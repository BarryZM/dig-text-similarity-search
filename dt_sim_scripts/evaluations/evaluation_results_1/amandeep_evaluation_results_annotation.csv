"Will the Sri Lankan government carry out an execution before 8 September 2018?
",1041a02dedcd90fb2ac021e3da396523cbaa496d56994ce1cef1e056037b4194,"Pakistan, Aug. 7 -- This weekend heavy protests broke out in Dhaka when a vehicle killed two teenagers. Many young students protested and the government resorted to excessive use of force. The police fired rubber bullets and used tear gas against the protesters. Reportedly, pro-government mobs attacked the peaceful protestors and more than one hundred protesters were injured.<br/><br/>Shahidul Alam was one of the photojournalists who recorded this demonstration. This Sunday evening, he told Al Jazeera that the reason behind the protests was dissatisfaction with the government's performance and not just road safety. On Monday morning, 20 officers in plain clothes abducted Alam from his home. A police officer told AFP that Alam is being interrogated for ""giving false information to different media and for provocative comments.""<br/><br/>Later, he was produced in a court. He told AFP that he was beaten, and his blood-soaked clothes were washed before he appeared in the court.<br/><br/>Bangladesh is currently ranked as number 146 on the World Press Freedom Index. The Reporters Without Borders, an organization that monitors press freedom and safety across the world, raised concerns about the ""endemic violence"" against journalists and the ""systematic impunity"" enjoyed by the violators.<br/><br/>""In Bangladesh, it is a bad idea to criticize the constitution or Islam, although the country is officially secular,"" the report said. The Information and Communication Technology ACT 2006 (ICT Act), under which Shahidul Alam is due to be tried, is controversial, to say the least. The Section 57 of the statute has been allegedly used to harass journalists and activists. This statute punishes ""obscene or false"" information with seven years in prison and heavy fines.<br/><br/>The aggressive crackdown on the protests by youngsters and now the arrest of an internationally acclaimed photojournalist will do the Bangladeshi government no good. Right now, not only the country's reputation but its commitment to democracy is under question. Hopefully, the Bangladeshi government will realise the grave mistake and release Shahidul Alam. *<br/><br/>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily Times.

"Will Iran execute or be targeted in an acknowledged national military attack outside of Syria involving Israel or any G7 nation between 23 August and 7 September 2018?
",19a1380091d82d9563b252804027cf65d0faa0e93783dc43f083b97ceff8626e,"Iran's reaction to latest deadly strikes to determine the length and intensity of confrontation, say analysts.<br/><br/> Israeli raids against alleged Iranian targets inside Syria have raised fears of a major confrontation in the Middle East.  Amid international calls for restraint and calm, Israeli officials said Thursday's attacks were not aimed at opening a new front in Syria's war, but analysts say much will depend on Iran's response.  The Israeli military has said that its warplanes targeted intelligence, logistics, storage and vehicles in response to rocket fire targeting its forces in the occupied Golan Heights, which it blames on Iran.  Avigdor Lieberman, Israel's defence minister, said the Israeli assault struck ""almost all of the Iranian infrastructure in Syria"", and added that Israel will desist from launching any further attacks. <br/><br/> ""I hope we finished this chapter and everyone got the message,"" he said, but warned that ""if it rains on us [Israel], it will pour on them [Iran].""  Iran has not commented on the rocket fire.  Situation unclear  The situation remains unclear, with an independent war monitor claiming  the rockets followed a ""first Israeli bombardment on the town of Baath"" in Quneitra province.  Also on Tuesday, Syrian state media reported attacks on a military base in Kisweh, south of Damascus, and accused Israel of carrying out the raid.  The strikes on Kisweh came shortly after President  Donald Trump  announced US withdrawal from the 2015  Iran nuclear deal , and resulted in the deaths of 15 people, eight of whom were Iranians, according to the war monitor.    Iranian forces based in Syria reportedly retaliated the next day, launching 20 rockets in the direction of the Israeli-occupied Syrian territory of Golan Heights.  The Israeli military accused Iran's Revolutionary Guard (IRGC) and its Quds Force, headed by General Qassem Suleimani, of being behind the attack.  Analysts said the Israeli retaliation was meant to signal Tel Aviv's resolve, without allowing the conflict spiral out of control.  ""I don't think Israel is interested in continuing a prolonged war with Iran because this might spill over to other theatres, including in Lebanon with Hezbollah, effectively making it a proxy war,"" Yossi Mekelberg, a professor of international relations at Regent's University, London, told Al Jazeera.  ""Israel runs the risk, by doing what it did, that Iran will feel almost obliged and forced to retaliate again.  ""That's the danger when things like this start, you don't know how and who's going to stop. You know how it starts, but you don't know how it will end.""  'We'd like to stop'  Mekelberg said the message that Israel was trying to get across is that it was not interested in escalation.  By saying ""we achieved our objectives, Israel is effectively saying 'we'd like to stop'"", he said.  However, ""the ball is now in the court of Iran.""  Ghanbar Naderi, an Iranian political analyst, said it was unlikely that Iran will pull back and relinquish all the gains it has made in Syria in recent years.    In Naderi's view, the attacks on Iranian outposts are a last-ditch attempt by Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, to save face as he struggles to accept the Syrian government and its Iranian backers' successive victories.  ""At the end of the day, this is a limited campaign in order to send the message that they have not lost the war.  ""I think they have lost the war and should call it quits and allow Syria to reconstruct itself from scratch,"" Naderi said.  Naderi, however, is unequivocal about Iran's willingness and ability to retaliate in the event of future Israeli aggression.  ""This is not the first time that Israel attacks Syria from the Golan Heights and certainly won't be the last one,"" he says.  ""We are expecting more attacks in the coming weeks and months. But the simple fact is that Iran is going to stay in Syria.  ""If Israel hits Syrian or Iranian forces, there will be retaliation. This is no longer the Syria of five or six years ago.""",19a1380091d82d9563b252804027cf65d0faa0e93783dc43f083b97ceff8626e_30,"""If Israel hits Syrian or Iranian forces, there will be retaliation.",0.2337058335542679,13.005064249038696,3

Israel fired dozens of missiles at what it said were Iranian positions in Syria on Thursday, hours after it said its forces in the occupied Golan Heights had been targeted by Iranian rockets. The brief but intense confrontation raised fears the region may be sliding into an unprecedented direct conflict between the two archenemies. <br/><br/>Here is a look at why the two countries are at each's other throats and why Syria could be the ground for a showdown. Why Syria? Iran sent massive military help to its ally, Assad, to rescue his rule against armed rebellion during that country's seven-year-old civil war. With the war winding down in favor of Assad, Israel   which saw him as the lesser of two evils compared with Islamic hard-liners among rebels   is now finding that his victory has brought Iran closer to its borders. Israel has increasingly warned that it sees Iranian influence in Syria as a threat, pointing to Iran's military presence inside the country as well as that of Iranian-backed militiamen. Israeli officials have said that 80,000 Shiite fighters in Syria are under Iranian control, including forces of Lebanon's Hezbollah and Iraqi and Afghan fighters. Iranian officials and their allies have spoken of securing a corridor from Iran to Lebanon, through Syria and Iraq. Israel fears that will allow Iran to more easily transfer weapons to Hezbollah, Lebanon's powerful Shiite guerrilla force, and reinforce the militant group's influence over the region. During the civil war, Israel is believed to have carried out hundreds of strikes in Syria, mainly hitting weapons shipments. Tension has been building. An airstrike on a military base in Syria last month, which Iran and Russia blamed on Israel, killed seven Iranians. In February, Israel shot down an Iranian drone that entered its airspace, triggering a clash in which an Israeli warplane crashed after being struck by Syrian anti-aircraft fire. What does the nuclear deal have to do with rising tensions? Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a sharp critic of the Iran nuclear deal. Now, with President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from it, Netanyahu may be emboldened to pursue his confrontation with Iran. Tehran, meanwhile, is under pressure from the U.S. and Western allies to negotiate a new deal, one that goes beyond restricting the nuclear program to curb Iran's military power in the region. Iranian officials have rejected any new accord. Tehran has not completely walked away from the nuclear deal, since the Europeans are still participating. But if it collapses and the U.S. imposes heavy new sanctions on Iran, prospects for major fallout with Israel are higher. Have Israel and Iran always been mortal enemies? During the rule of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, Iran had close relations with Israel, starting in the 1950s, including diplomatic representations and direct flights. The two countries were the main allies of the United States in the region, and Iranian oil was shipped to Israel during the 1973 war. But the 1979 Islamic Revolution ousting the shah ended that. The revolution's leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, declared Israel an ""enemy of Islam"" and cut all ties. Hostile rhetoric has escalated over the decades since. Israel considers the government in Iran an existential threat. But unlike Israel and its Arab neighbors, the two countries have never had a direct confrontation. Instead, Israel has fought Iran's ally, Hezbollah, the last time in a 2006 war that saw massive destruction in southern Lebanon and concentrated rocket fire on Israeli cities. Is the Mideast sliding toward an all-encompassing war? The reported Iranian attack on Israeli positions in the Golan and Israel's bombardment of suspected Iranian posts in Syria appeared to be warnings by each side that it is willing to respond   but not necessarily that they want to plunge into war. But if they do escalate, the region could face one of its worst cross-border conflicts in decades, one that could potentially drag in the United States, a major ally of Israel, and Russia, which is Syria's mightiest ally. Although Iran may not be a match for Israel's military power, it has a variety of allies and ways to hit back if corned by the U.S., Israel and Saudi Arabia, Iran's regional rival. Iran has an ally in Hamas, the Palestinian militant group in Gaza. In Lebanon, Hezbollah would stand ready to support its patron Iran. In Iraq, Iran sponsors a range of Shiite militias and has close ties to the political leadership. In Yemen, the war in its fourth year is seen as a proxy between Saudi Arabia and Iran and can be a place for Tehran to retaliate and increase pressure.

The revolution's leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, declared Israel an ""enemy of Islam"" and cut all ties. Hostile rhetoric has escalated over the decades since. Israel considers the government in Iran an existential threat. But unlike Israel and its Arab neighbors, the two countries have never had a direct confrontation. Instead, Israel has fought Iran's ally, Hezbollah, the last time in a 2006 war that saw massive destruction in southern Lebanon and concentrated rocket fire on Israeli cities. Is the Mideast sliding toward an all-encompassing war? The reported Iranian attack on Israeli positions in the Golan and Israel's bombardment of suspected Iranian posts in Syria appeared to be warnings by each side that it is willing to respond   but not necessarily that they want to plunge into war. But if they do escalate, the region could face one of its worst cross-border conflicts in decades, one that could potentially drag in the United States, a major ally of Israel, and Russia, which is Syria's mightiest ally. Although Iran may not be a match for Israel's military power, it has a variety of allies and ways to hit back if corned by the U.S., Israel and Saudi Arabia, Iran's regional rival. Iran has an ally in Hamas, the Palestinian militant group in Gaza. In Lebanon, Hezbollah would stand ready to support its patron Iran. In Iraq, Iran sponsors a range of Shiite militias and has close ties to the political leadership.

",4f6d2d03f13767aea022196f327b3dec3d4c6ed35856fe04ca16df9130b9c0d4,"May 12, 2018( Voice of America: http://www.voanews.com Delivered by Newstex)  In the escalating confrontation between Israel and Iran, Israel's defense minister called on Syria's President Bashar al-Assad on Friday to rid his country of Iranian forces based there, warning their presence would only cause more trouble for the war-ravaged country.  Avigdor Lieberman's comments were followed by threats from an Iranian cleric that Tel Aviv or Haifa would be in danger if Israel did ""anything foolish.""  The war of words followed the worst faceoff to date between Israel and Iran. Israel fired dozens of missiles at what it said were Iranian positions in Syria on Thursday, hours after it said its forces in the occupied Golan Heights had been targeted by Iranian rockets. The brief but intense confrontation raised fears the region may be sliding into an unprecedented direct conflict between the two archenemies. <br/><br/>Here is a look at why the two countries are at each's other throats and why Syria could be the ground for a showdown. Why Syria? Iran sent massive military help to its ally, Assad, to rescue his rule against armed rebellion during that country's seven-year-old civil war. With the war winding down in favor of Assad, Israel   which saw him as the lesser of two evils compared with Islamic hard-liners among rebels   is now finding that his victory has brought Iran closer to its borders. Israel has increasingly warned that it sees Iranian influence in Syria as a threat, pointing to Iran's military presence inside the country as well as that of Iranian-backed militiamen. Israeli officials have said that 80,000 Shiite fighters in Syria are under Iranian control, including forces of Lebanon's Hezbollah and Iraqi and Afghan fighters. Iranian officials and their allies have spoken of securing a corridor from Iran to Lebanon, through Syria and Iraq. Israel fears that will allow Iran to more easily transfer weapons to Hezbollah, Lebanon's powerful Shiite guerrilla force, and reinforce the militant group's influence over the region. During the civil war, Israel is believed to have carried out hundreds of strikes in Syria, mainly hitting weapons shipments. Tension has been building. An airstrike on a military base in Syria last month, which Iran and Russia blamed on Israel, killed seven Iranians. In February, Israel shot down an Iranian drone that entered its airspace, triggering a clash in which an Israeli warplane crashed after being struck by Syrian anti-aircraft fire. What does the nuclear deal have to do with rising tensions? Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a sharp critic of the Iran nuclear deal. Now, with President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from it, Netanyahu may be emboldened to pursue his confrontation with Iran. Tehran, meanwhile, is under pressure from the U.S. and Western allies to negotiate a new deal, one that goes beyond restricting the nuclear program to curb Iran's military power in the region. Iranian officials have rejected any new accord. Tehran has not completely walked away from the nuclear deal, since the Europeans are still participating. But if it collapses and the U.S. imposes heavy new sanctions on Iran, prospects for major fallout with Israel are higher. Have Israel and Iran always been mortal enemies? During the rule of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, Iran had close relations with Israel, starting in the 1950s, including diplomatic representations and direct flights. The two countries were the main allies of the United States in the region, and Iranian oil was shipped to Israel during the 1973 war. But the 1979 Islamic Revolution ousting the shah ended that. The revolution's leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, declared Israel an ""enemy of Islam"" and cut all ties. Hostile rhetoric has escalated over the decades since.

",bb0e0edaaee7651610c0d01ee0b9fe3782b540d206a29e2d0fd053a065dfb778,"The Middle East woke up to a more unstable and less certain world on Wednesday. Much remains unknown about the implementation and impact of US President Donald Trump's May 8 decision to reimpose all nuclear-related sanctions on Iran. But consequences will be multidimensional, and they will almost certainly hit the region a lot sooner than the up to six-month deadline Washington has given companies to cut commercial ties with Iran. Already, a full-scale war is threatening to break out between Israel and Iranian forces amid tit-for-tat strikes on military bases in Syria and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.<br/><br/>Another inflection point is Washington's already fraught relationship with Ankara. Next week, a US court is expected to deliver sentencing in a case implicating Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Iran sanctions violations, with potential billion-dollar fines looming ( EC Jan.12'18 ). In the coming days, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu is due to meet with new US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Washington. In addition to attempting to muffle the political fallout from the court case, the two have to address multiple points of confrontation -- including over Syria and its Kurds, arms purchases from Russia and US asylum for the Turkish cleric, Fethullah Gulen, accused of being behind the failed July 2016 coup attempt ( EC Apr.13'18 ).<br/><br/>Ankara's cooperation in Washington's aggressive new effort to isolate Tehran is critical. In addition to its regional clout, Turkey is the fourth-largest importer of Iranian crude, buying some 219,000 barrels per day over the last 12 months. But for Washington to have any hope of gaining traction in moderating Turkish commercial ties with Iran, some form of compromise is probably going to be needed on its other many points of dispute with Ankara.<br/><br/>So far, Tehran has said it will stay committed to its nuclear deal, provided Europe stays onside and the deal continues to deliver benefits. But on the face of it, Trump's announcement looks set to not just kill Iranian ambitions to attract Western investment to its upstream but also to smother already challenged regional energy projects -- particularly if the US decides to widen its sanctions campaign to include gas. Both Turkey, the biggest importer of Iranian gas, and Iraq, which also depends on Iranian gas, would bitterly oppose such a move, while Oman is also eyeing Iranian gas flows. Iraq also aims to export Kirkuk crude to northern Iranian refineries.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, increased aggression on the part of Iranian hard-liners and their regional proxies can be expected -- with the reimposition of Iranian oil sanctions as likely to play out in battlefields in Syria and Yemen as it is on international oil markets ( EC May4'18 ). That's already happening between Israel and Iran in Syria. For a still-fragile Iraq, the Iran decision is an unwelcome wildcard as it goes to the polls on May 12 ( EC Apr.27'18 ).<br/><br/>Opec, and US-Saudi, Tripwire?<br/><br/>Implementation of Washington's new Iran policy is likely to be a slower, more haphazard process than Trump would wish for ( related ). But there will be a supply impact, and it comes at a delicate time for Opec. The Saudi energy ministry on Wednesday vowed to ""mitigate the impact of any potential supply shortages,"" and Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said he would be ""connecting with other producers and major consumers over the next few days to ensure market stability.""<br/><br/>But Riyadh has a difficult balancing act. On a political level, it has been pushing for a concerted international effort against alleged Iranian regional aggression. But unwritten Opec rules dictate that any supply response to a shortage be consensual. In addition to destroying hard-won Opec unity, any unilateral Saudi action could threaten current cooperation with Russia-led non-Opec producers and unravel attempts to build a new Opec/non-Opec market management structure ( EC Mar.2'18 ). Gulf Opec sources tell <em>Energy Compass</em> that Riyadh will not back any action to respond to a short-term price spike and that a rollover is the most likely outcome of Opec's Vienna meeting in June ( related ).<br/><br/>Higher oil prices are already a problem in Saudi-US relations, with Trump last month tweeting complaints about Opec policy ( EC May4'18 ). The US leader told Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman during his April visit to Washington that he was losing sleep over the fact that Russia and Iran were reaping hundreds of millions of dollars a day in oil revenue as a result of high prices, one source tells <em>Energy Compass</em>. Saudi Arabia needs firm prices to balance the books and to lay the groundwork for a planned initial public offering (IPO) of Saudi Aramco. But price stability is paramount, and the last thing Riyadh wants is for high prices to spark such a surge in US shale output that it triggers another sustained price slump.<br/><br/>Trump has also voiced concern over Saudi Arabia's new energy alliance with Russia, the source adds. With historically frosty relations and opposing positions on Syria, Riyadh and Moscow are unlikely bed partners. But Russia's participation in the Opec/non-Opec deal and planned joint investments, including potentially a Russian stake in Aramco and Saudi investment in Russian LNG projects, serve both sides well. The danger is what happens if escalating international tensions prompt Washington to lean on Riyadh to ditch its new Russia alliance. <br/><br/>This has been a good two years for Opec. Al- Falih has presided over a period of strong price recovery, organizational cohesion and unprecedented cooperation with non-Opec. But Trump’s Iran sanctions move threatens a cardinal tenet of Opec policy -- that oil and politics should not mix -- and how the organization responds is going to be critical. <br/><br/>Rafiq Latta, Nicosia, and Amena Bakr, Dubai<br/><br/>  Compass Points:<br/><br/>• SIGNIFICANCE: The Iran nuclear deal was already slowly dying, but Trump's May 8 announcement has closed off avenues to revive it while escalating regional tensions.<br/><br/>• CONTEXT: Progress on North Korean nuclear talks will impact how much capacity the severely understaffed US administration has to devote to Iran sanctions implementation.<br/><br/>• NEXT: Watch out for a politically damaging oil price surge, and major Mideast turmoil. Both will have Trump's fingerprints all over them, and could influence critical US midterm elections in November.",bb0e0edaaee7651610c0d01ee0b9fe3782b540d206a29e2d0fd053a065dfb778_3,"Already, a full-scale war is threatening to break out between Israel and Iranian forces amid tit-for-tat strikes on military bases in Syria and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.

",a036f96561d61b3517a8781f1b326ffa6f8b79a229f2655d25605012bd52857c,"LAST week, Google held its I/O conference in California. As you'd expect, it was a technophile's dream. Google demoed how its personal assistant will soon be able make phone calls on your behalf and sound like a real human being. This new feature is powered, of course, by artificial intelligence (AI). Google photos will be upgraded to automatically suggest tweaks that improve your snaps. Again, this uses AI. Gmail will get a new feature called Smart Compose, which uses AI to suggest phrases as you type. And Google News is also getting a revamp, thanks to, you guessed it, AI.<br/><br/>The new Google News brings together several existing news products into one app and website. It will analyse the constant flow of news information as it hits the web in real time, and organise it into storylines.<br/><br/>Users can look forward to a daily briefing of five stories, personalised according to the users' reading habits. Simple controls will allow them to see more or less of a topic or from a particular publisher. There's a new visual format called newscasts, which offer different perspectives by bringing together articles, videos and quotes on a single topic from a host of sources. Plus, there's a feature called full coverage, which will allow users to get a deeper understanding of a story.<br/><br/>But it's not just readers that Google is courting with this new News product. It's batting its eyelashes at publishers, too. Google News promises to play nice with paywalls. Users will be able to subscribe for paid content with their Google account. There'll be no complex sign-up processes, no credit card numbers, and no new passwords. Users will be able to access paid content on all platforms and devices, on Google News, Google Search, and on publishers' own websites. Of course, Google will take a small cut of the subscription fee.<br/><br/>It all sounds impressive. But is this the future of news, or just another aggregator? Well, the first hurdle that Google will have to clear is the filter bubble issue that Facebook fell foul of with its news feed. Personalised news services will always be guilty of the sin of omission. Read a news website, or a newspaper and something interesting happens: serendipitous discovery of news. You find and read stories that you may not necessarily have gone looking for. Sometimes these are about difficult societal issues, sometimes they're informed opinions on something you know nothing about, sometimes they're utterly flippant.<br/><br/>However, they've made it onto the page because the publication in question deems them culturally relevant. In designing a newsfeed that kept users hooked for as long as possible, Facebook ditched this principal.<br/><br/>Google has said an algorithm fed by a few hundred signals will have the job of surfacing stories from trusted sources. And it will undoubtedly add that the user has full control over what appears in their daily briefing or newscasts. But it will be interesting to monitor how these features are populated, and what behaviours the new Google news promotes.<br/><br/>Privacy is another issue that Google news needs to address. With GDPR and a greater awareness of how firms like to store and use personal data, it will be interesting to see whether most people will be willing to trade privacy for personalised news. Given the amount of information Google holds on us thanks to products like Chrome, Android, Gmail and more, chances are convenience will win out.<br/><br/>Perhaps a more difficult issue will be keeping publishers sweet. Along with Apple, Facebook and a few others, it's a gatekeeper, controlling access to digital news. With Facebook deprioritising news, Apple likely to launch its own digital subscription product soon, and Google owning its own chunk of the audience, how long before publishers stop relying on their digital frenemies as online intermediaries? How long before they realise they should have a direct relationship with their customers? But the most interesting question relates to Google's all-pervasive AI crusade. Google's stated aim here is to save users' time by taking troublesome tasks off their plate. But let's look at the tasks they're trying to speed up. Making phonecalls. Writing emails. Staying informed.<br/><br/>Google may be able to shave nanoseconds off these activities, but are these really the tasks we need help with? Wouldn't we all be better off if we took the time to communicate with each other and stay informed, rather than outsourcing these activities to the apogee of surveillance capitalism? How much personalisation will it take before the world becomes a very impersonal place?",a036f96561d61b3517a8781f1b326ffa6f8b79a229f2655d25605012bd52857c_22,"But is this the future of news, or just another aggregator?",0.6759961247444153,14.72986650466919,0

Amid international calls for restraint and calm, Israeli officials said Thursday's attacks were not aimed at opening a new front in Syria's war, but analysts say much will depend on Iran's response.  The Israeli military has said that its warplanes targeted intelligence, logistics, storage and vehicles in response to rocket fire targeting its forces in the occupied Golan Heights, which it blames on Iran.  Avigdor Lieberman, Israel's defence minister, said the Israeli assault struck ""almost all of the Iranian infrastructure in Syria"", and added that Israel will desist from launching any further attacks. <br/><br/> ""I hope we finished this chapter and everyone got the message,"" he said, but warned that ""if it rains on us [Israel], it will pour on them [Iran].""  Iran has not commented on the rocket fire.  Situation unclear  The situation remains unclear, with an independent war monitor claiming  the rockets followed a ""first Israeli bombardment on the town of Baath"" in Quneitra province.  Also on Tuesday, Syrian state media reported attacks on a military base in Kisweh, south of Damascus, and accused Israel of carrying out the raid.  The strikes on Kisweh came shortly after President  Donald Trump  announced US withdrawal from the 2015  Iran nuclear deal , and resulted in the deaths of 15 people, eight of whom were Iranians, according to the war monitor.    Iranian forces based in Syria reportedly retaliated the next day, launching 20 rockets in the direction of the Israeli-occupied Syrian territory of Golan Heights.  The Israeli military accused Iran's Revolutionary Guard (IRGC) and its Quds Force, headed by General Qassem Suleimani, of being behind the attack.  Analysts said the Israeli retaliation was meant to signal Tel Aviv's resolve, without allowing the conflict spiral out of control.  ""I don't think Israel is interested in continuing a prolonged war with Iran because this might spill over to other theatres, including in Lebanon with Hezbollah, effectively making it a proxy war,"" Yossi Mekelberg, a professor of international relations at Regent's University, London, told Al Jazeera.  ""Israel runs the risk, by doing what it did, that Iran will feel almost obliged and forced to retaliate again.  ""That's the danger when things like this start, you don't know how and who's going to stop. You know how it starts, but you don't know how it will end.""  'We'd like to stop'  Mekelberg said the message that Israel was trying to get across is that it was not interested in escalation.  By saying ""we achieved our objectives, Israel is effectively saying 'we'd like to stop'"", he said.  However, ""the ball is now in the court of Iran.""  Ghanbar Naderi, an Iranian political analyst, said it was unlikely that Iran will pull back and relinquish all the gains it has made in Syria in recent years.    In Naderi's view, the attacks on Iranian outposts are a last-ditch attempt by Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, to save face as he struggles to accept the Syrian government and its Iranian backers' successive victories.  ""At the end of the day, this is a limited campaign in order to send the message that they have not lost the war.  ""I think they have lost the war and should call it quits and allow Syria to reconstruct itself from scratch,"" Naderi said.  Naderi, however, is unequivocal about Iran's willingness and ability to retaliate in the event of future Israeli aggression.  ""This is not the first time that Israel attacks Syria from the Golan Heights and certainly won't be the last one,"" he says.  ""We are expecting more attacks in the coming weeks and months. But the simple fact is that Iran is going to stay in Syria.  ""If Israel hits Syrian or Iranian forces, there will be retaliation. This is no longer the Syria of five or six years ago.""",19a1380091d82d9563b252804027cf65d0faa0e93783dc43f083b97ceff8626e_30,"""If Israel hits Syrian or Iranian forces, there will be retaliation.",0.2337058335542679,15.588939189910887,1

Israel fired dozens of missiles at what it said were Iranian positions in Syria on Thursday, hours after it said its forces in the occupied Golan Heights had been targeted by Iranian rockets. The brief but intense confrontation raised fears the region may be sliding into an unprecedented direct conflict between the two archenemies. <br/><br/>Here is a look at why the two countries are at each's other throats and why Syria could be the ground for a showdown. Why Syria? Iran sent massive military help to its ally, Assad, to rescue his rule against armed rebellion during that country's seven-year-old civil war. With the war winding down in favor of Assad, Israel   which saw him as the lesser of two evils compared with Islamic hard-liners among rebels   is now finding that his victory has brought Iran closer to its borders. Israel has increasingly warned that it sees Iranian influence in Syria as a threat, pointing to Iran's military presence inside the country as well as that of Iranian-backed militiamen. Israeli officials have said that 80,000 Shiite fighters in Syria are under Iranian control, including forces of Lebanon's Hezbollah and Iraqi and Afghan fighters. Iranian officials and their allies have spoken of securing a corridor from Iran to Lebanon, through Syria and Iraq. Israel fears that will allow Iran to more easily transfer weapons to Hezbollah, Lebanon's powerful Shiite guerrilla force, and reinforce the militant group's influence over the region. During the civil war, Israel is believed to have carried out hundreds of strikes in Syria, mainly hitting weapons shipments. Tension has been building. An airstrike on a military base in Syria last month, which Iran and Russia blamed on Israel, killed seven Iranians. In February, Israel shot down an Iranian drone that entered its airspace, triggering a clash in which an Israeli warplane crashed after being struck by Syrian anti-aircraft fire. What does the nuclear deal have to do with rising tensions? Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a sharp critic of the Iran nuclear deal. Now, with President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from it, Netanyahu may be emboldened to pursue his confrontation with Iran. Tehran, meanwhile, is under pressure from the U.S. and Western allies to negotiate a new deal, one that goes beyond restricting the nuclear program to curb Iran's military power in the region. Iranian officials have rejected any new accord. Tehran has not completely walked away from the nuclear deal, since the Europeans are still participating. But if it collapses and the U.S. imposes heavy new sanctions on Iran, prospects for major fallout with Israel are higher. Have Israel and Iran always been mortal enemies? During the rule of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, Iran had close relations with Israel, starting in the 1950s, including diplomatic representations and direct flights. The two countries were the main allies of the United States in the region, and Iranian oil was shipped to Israel during the 1973 war. But the 1979 Islamic Revolution ousting the shah ended that. The revolution's leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, declared Israel an ""enemy of Islam"" and cut all ties. Hostile rhetoric has escalated over the decades since. Israel considers the government in Iran an existential threat. But unlike Israel and its Arab neighbors, the two countries have never had a direct confrontation. Instead, Israel has fought Iran's ally, Hezbollah, the last time in a 2006 war that saw massive destruction in southern Lebanon and concentrated rocket fire on Israeli cities. Is the Mideast sliding toward an all-encompassing war? The reported Iranian attack on Israeli positions in the Golan and Israel's bombardment of suspected Iranian posts in Syria appeared to be warnings by each side that it is willing to respond   but not necessarily that they want to plunge into war. But if they do escalate, the region could face one of its worst cross-border conflicts in decades, one that could potentially drag in the United States, a major ally of Israel, and Russia, which is Syria's mightiest ally. Although Iran may not be a match for Israel's military power, it has a variety of allies and ways to hit back if corned by the U.S., Israel and Saudi Arabia, Iran's regional rival. Iran has an ally in Hamas, the Palestinian militant group in Gaza. In Lebanon, Hezbollah would stand ready to support its patron Iran. In Iraq, Iran sponsors a range of Shiite militias and has close ties to the political leadership.

",bb0e0edaaee7651610c0d01ee0b9fe3782b540d206a29e2d0fd053a065dfb778,"The Middle East woke up to a more unstable and less certain world on Wednesday. Much remains unknown about the implementation and impact of US President Donald Trump's May 8 decision to reimpose all nuclear-related sanctions on Iran. But consequences will be multidimensional, and they will almost certainly hit the region a lot sooner than the up to six-month deadline Washington has given companies to cut commercial ties with Iran. Already, a full-scale war is threatening to break out between Israel and Iranian forces amid tit-for-tat strikes on military bases in Syria and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.<br/><br/>Another inflection point is Washington's already fraught relationship with Ankara. Next week, a US court is expected to deliver sentencing in a case implicating Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Iran sanctions violations, with potential billion-dollar fines looming ( EC Jan.12'18 ). In the coming days, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu is due to meet with new US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Washington. In addition to attempting to muffle the political fallout from the court case, the two have to address multiple points of confrontation -- including over Syria and its Kurds, arms purchases from Russia and US asylum for the Turkish cleric, Fethullah Gulen, accused of being behind the failed July 2016 coup attempt ( EC Apr.13'18 ).<br/><br/>Ankara's cooperation in Washington's aggressive new effort to isolate Tehran is critical. In addition to its regional clout, Turkey is the fourth-largest importer of Iranian crude, buying some 219,000 barrels per day over the last 12 months. But for Washington to have any hope of gaining traction in moderating Turkish commercial ties with Iran, some form of compromise is probably going to be needed on its other many points of dispute with Ankara.<br/><br/>So far, Tehran has said it will stay committed to its nuclear deal, provided Europe stays onside and the deal continues to deliver benefits. But on the face of it, Trump's announcement looks set to not just kill Iranian ambitions to attract Western investment to its upstream but also to smother already challenged regional energy projects -- particularly if the US decides to widen its sanctions campaign to include gas. Both Turkey, the biggest importer of Iranian gas, and Iraq, which also depends on Iranian gas, would bitterly oppose such a move, while Oman is also eyeing Iranian gas flows. Iraq also aims to export Kirkuk crude to northern Iranian refineries.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, increased aggression on the part of Iranian hard-liners and their regional proxies can be expected -- with the reimposition of Iranian oil sanctions as likely to play out in battlefields in Syria and Yemen as it is on international oil markets ( EC May4'18 ). That's already happening between Israel and Iran in Syria. For a still-fragile Iraq, the Iran decision is an unwelcome wildcard as it goes to the polls on May 12 ( EC Apr.27'18 ).<br/><br/>Opec, and US-Saudi, Tripwire?<br/><br/>Implementation of Washington's new Iran policy is likely to be a slower, more haphazard process than Trump would wish for ( related ). But there will be a supply impact, and it comes at a delicate time for Opec. The Saudi energy ministry on Wednesday vowed to ""mitigate the impact of any potential supply shortages,"" and Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said he would be ""connecting with other producers and major consumers over the next few days to ensure market stability.""<br/><br/>But Riyadh has a difficult balancing act. On a political level, it has been pushing for a concerted international effort against alleged Iranian regional aggression. But unwritten Opec rules dictate that any supply response to a shortage be consensual. In addition to destroying hard-won Opec unity, any unilateral Saudi action could threaten current cooperation with Russia-led non-Opec producers and unravel attempts to build a new Opec/non-Opec market management structure ( EC Mar.2'18 ). Gulf Opec sources tell <em>Energy Compass</em> that Riyadh will not back any action to respond to a short-term price spike and that a rollover is the most likely outcome of Opec's Vienna meeting in June ( related ).<br/><br/>Higher oil prices are already a problem in Saudi-US relations, with Trump last month tweeting complaints about Opec policy ( EC May4'18 ). The US leader told Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman during his April visit to Washington that he was losing sleep over the fact that Russia and Iran were reaping hundreds of millions of dollars a day in oil revenue as a result of high prices, one source tells <em>Energy Compass</em>. Saudi Arabia needs firm prices to balance the books and to lay the groundwork for a planned initial public offering (IPO) of Saudi Aramco. But price stability is paramount, and the last thing Riyadh wants is for high prices to spark such a surge in US shale output that it triggers another sustained price slump.<br/><br/>Trump has also voiced concern over Saudi Arabia's new energy alliance with Russia, the source adds. With historically frosty relations and opposing positions on Syria, Riyadh and Moscow are unlikely bed partners. But Russia's participation in the Opec/non-Opec deal and planned joint investments, including potentially a Russian stake in Aramco and Saudi investment in Russian LNG projects, serve both sides well. The danger is what happens if escalating international tensions prompt Washington to lean on Riyadh to ditch its new Russia alliance. <br/><br/>This has been a good two years for Opec. Al- Falih has presided over a period of strong price recovery, organizational cohesion and unprecedented cooperation with non-Opec. But Trump’s Iran sanctions move threatens a cardinal tenet of Opec policy -- that oil and politics should not mix -- and how the organization responds is going to be critical. <br/><br/>Rafiq Latta, Nicosia, and Amena Bakr, Dubai<br/><br/>  Compass Points:<br/><br/>• SIGNIFICANCE: The Iran nuclear deal was already slowly dying, but Trump's May 8 announcement has closed off avenues to revive it while escalating regional tensions.<br/><br/>• CONTEXT: Progress on North Korean nuclear talks will impact how much capacity the severely understaffed US administration has to devote to Iran sanctions implementation.<br/><br/>• NEXT: Watch out for a politically damaging oil price surge, and major Mideast turmoil. Both will have Trump's fingerprints all over them, and could influence critical US midterm elections in November.",bb0e0edaaee7651610c0d01ee0b9fe3782b540d206a29e2d0fd053a065dfb778_3,"Already, a full-scale war is threatening to break out between Israel and Iranian forces amid tit-for-tat strikes on military bases in Syria and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.

",7f8a80f4e5323b278260ccaf654516a67d05fdddfb362f1226f199c029c04857,"Members of the British parliament will be offered a chance to vote on remaining in the European Economic Area (EEA) after leaving the European Union, following a surprise vote in the House of Lords late on Tuesday (8 May).<br/><br/>Despite neither the UK government nor the opposition Labour party leadership approving it, an amendment to the EU withdrawal bill obliging the UK to stay in the European Economic Area after it leaves the EU in 2019 was backed by a majority of 245 Lords against 218.<br/><br/>The vote result came as a surprise, because Labour had urged its peers to abstain in the vote. But 83 Labour peers revolted against Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's strategy and secured the majority by voting for the amendment.<br/><br/>As all amendments that are passed by the Lords must automatically be considered and voted on by MPs, the Commons will now need to vote on it too, which could happens as soon as next week.<br/><br/>The Norway model<br/><br/>The EEA is also known as the 'Norway model', because Norway is the most important of the three non-EU countries currently using the model for their relations with the European Union.<br/><br/>Legally EEA members are all the EU countries plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.<br/><br/>Under the model Norway has agreed to accept all EU legislation regarding the single market, and to accept all future legislation that the EU might adopt for the single market in return for free access to the European single market.<br/><br/>The amendment in the House of Lords to stay in the EEA was tabled by Labour Lord Alli, who asked fellow Lords to ""support it and ensure that common sense prevails over political dogma"".<br/><br/>Eurosceptics argue that it would leave Britain as ""a vassal state"" to Brussels.<br/><br/>Stephen Kinnock, a Labour MP and a member of the Select Committee on Exiting the European Union supported in a comment in the Guardian the Norway model, saying that staying in the European Economic Area ""would not transgress the prime minister's red lines on the single market or on ECJ jurisdiction"".<br/><br/>""By committing to an EEA-based Brexit the government would be providing business, consumers and our entire country with the certainty and stability that is so desperately needed,"" Kinnock added.<br/><br/>Under EEA has Norway effectively renounced the right to adopt national legislation that may be in violation of the single market's legislation.<br/><br/>In return, Norwegian businesses and citizens get free access to the European single market.<br/><br/>Norwegian companies are able to compete for contracts on equal terms with EU companies and Norwegians can travel to and work in other EEA member states, while citizens of the EEA can travel to and work in Norway.<br/><br/>The EEA agreement does not come however free of charge. In the 2014-2021 agreement period, Norway will pay a total of almost â‚¬2.8bn.<br/><br/>A separate Surveillance Authority and Court of Justice ensures that obligations under the EEA agreement are fulfilled.<br/><br/>Stronger EEA<br/><br/>Theoretically, Norway can say ""no"" to new legislation if Norway feels it conflicts with its national interests or is irrelevant to the EEA. But until now, this has not happened.<br/><br/>There has also been surprisingly little debate in Norway about the agreement.<br/><br/>The reason is that it forms part of Norway's national compromise on its relationship with the EU.<br/><br/>A December opinion poll from Nationen and Klassekampen newspapers showed that a majority of 52 percent of Norwegians would vote yes to the EEA if a referendum was held tomorrow. While a larger majority of 66 percent would vote no to EU membership.<br/><br/>According to the Norwegian government would the EEA membership expire automatically when the United Kingdom leaves the EU.<br/><br/>The procedures are governed by Article 127 of the EEA Agreement but the article does not contain specific provisions for the negotiation of a withdrawal agreement, as provided for in Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union.<br/><br/>The article states that at least twelve months' notice must be given in writing for a country to leave the EEA, but so far has the UK not asked to withdraw, despite there being currently less than a year to when Britain leaves the EU.",7f8a80f4e5323b278260ccaf654516a67d05fdddfb362f1226f199c029c04857_28,"The article states that at least twelve months' notice must be given in writing for a country to leave the EEA, but so far has the UK not asked to withdraw, despite there being currently less than a year to when Britain leaves the EU.",0.4539358019828797,15.660131692886353,3

Quebec City, however, is about a two hour drive away from La Malbaie and the public wont be able to get anywhere near the key sites.<br/><br/>Civil society groups planning to gather peacefully during the summit warn the imposing battalion of police and the webs of metal barriers will unduly constrain their democratic right to be heard.<br/><br/>In the past, however, some demonstrations outside major international summits have erupted into violence.<br/><br/>To ensure theres enough muscle on the ground to protect the G7 sites, Ottawa will start ferrying officers from the RCMP and other forces to Quebec City later this month on chartered flights from seven other provinces, according to a tender notice issued by the government.<br/><br/>Related government documents dated Tuesday show that Ottawa awarded three contracts for the chartered flights totalling more than $2.2 million.<br/><br/>These charter aircraft are required to transport an estimated 3,000 RCMP and other police forces personnel and their personal and duty-related belongings, from across Canada to perform various site security functions for the 2018 G7 summit, said the statement of work on the notice.<br/><br/>The contract says the RCMP requires planes that can transport up to 200 passengers per flight.<br/><br/>It also outlined specific carry-on requirements for those on board.<br/><br/>All passengers are peace officers who have an operational requirement to access their firearm immediately before and immediately after the flight and are therefore required to carry their unloaded personal firearm on board the aircraft, said the document.<br/><br/>Ammunition, it also noted, would be packed in the checked baggage.<br/><br/>The aircraft companies will also be required to transport dog masters and their police service dogs, which are described in the document as German shepherds each between 70 and 100 pounds. The dogs, up to three per flight, will be kept in crates while on board and their handlers will be responsible for caring for them during the flights, the notice said.<br/><br/>The contract also requires the aircraft companies to provide in-flight meals and snacks, but notes that they will be accompanied by non-alcoholic drinks.<br/><br/>The document includes an example flight schedule, which lists 26 flights to Quebec City before the summit starting May 23. There will be 16 return flights for the officers  the first one will leave Quebec City on June 9, the final day of the summit, the schedule said.<br/><br/>The thick security in the region is a big concern for organizations hoping to send messages to the powerful G7 leaders on issues ranging from income inequality, to the need for greater environmental protection, to Indigenous rights.<br/><br/>These types of measures  whether its thousands of police, or soldiers, or 10-foot fences, or millions of dollars spent on security  just push those voices away and its a further disconnect from the elite gathering that the G7 represents, said Brent Patterson, political director for the Council of Canadians.<br/><br/>Theyre trying to make it as unfriendly and unwelcoming as possible.<br/><br/>Pattersons organization is planning to participate in events in Quebec City and La Malbaie during the G7 and its members will try to get as close to the summit site as possible.<br/><br/>In its February budget, the federal government earmarked about $600 million to cover security and logistics for the leaders summit and other G7-related events Canada will host this year.<br/><br/>A separate tender notice, which closes Thursday, is seeking bids to supply the RCMP with 238 rental vehicles for the G7.<br/><br/>The fleet, the document said, must include 118 short-term rentals of seven-passenger vans to transport security personnel, employees and equipment.<br/><br/>Most of the vans will be used to provide security for delegates in several locations, including the Fairmont Le Manoir Richelieu, which will host the summit, the Quebec City airport and the Bagotville air force base, where the G7 leaders aircraft will touch down.<br/><br/>In addition, the notice said the Mounties also require another 57 vans, which each hold 15 passengers, and 63 full-size sedans. 2018 Global Data Point.",142aff622a68dc631f0c04540753b8260bd7d7bc8a23e0028cbe8accbcaf58a2_16,"The document includes an example flight schedule, which lists 26 flights to Quebec City before the summit starting May 23.",0.6246614456176758,15.662435293197632,0

Results are expected on Monday, electoral officials said.<br/><br/>Iraq's three main ethnic and religious groups – the majority Shiite Arabs and minority Sunni Arabs and Kurds – have been at odds for decades. Sectarian divisions remain deep despite all three groups joining forces in 2014 to fight ISIS, which had seized large areas of northern and western Iraq and at one point seemed poised to move on Baghdad.<br/><br/>Mr Al Sistani, who in 2014 criticised Mr Al Maliki for security failures that helped ISIS storm the country, has repeatedly encouraged Iraqis to vote into power a new political class to combat corruption, in remarks considered to be a renewed attack on the former prime minister.<br/><br/>The poll came at a time when tensions are surging between Iran and the United States after President Donald Trump pulled out of a 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran this week. His withdrawal has raised fears of a renewed power struggle in Iraq between Tehran and Washington and the potential for a new outbreak of conflict in the Middle East.<br/><br/>Saudi Arabia, which in 2016 reopened its embassy in Baghdad and has seen ties with Iraq improve since, also has a lot at stake. Mr Al Abadi has maintained a middle ground approach to Iraq's foreign policy. However if Mr Ameri's Fateh bloc or Mr Al Maliki's State of Law coalition increase their number of seats in parliament, Baghdad could swing closer to Tehran.<br/><br/>Roughly 24.5 million Iraqi voters were eligible to cast ballots in a poll in which the dominant Shiite powerbrokers were split, the Kurds in disarray and the Sunnis sidelined. Overall, just under 7,000 candidates were standing, seeking a place in the 329-seat parliament in Baghdad.<br/><br/>Over 15 blood-sodden years since the US-led ousting of Saddam Hussein, disillusionment is widespread and politics is dominated by old faces from an elite seen as mired in corruption and sectarianism.<br/><br/>No attacks on polling stations were reported. In comparison, Iraq's elections in 2010 were marred by widespread violence and insecurity, with dozens of people killed on polling day by roadside bombs, rocket and mortar attacks in Baghdad, Tikrit, Baquba, Samarra, Mosul and Fallujah.<br/><br/>On Saturday, at a polling station in the majority Shiite Baghdad district of Karrada, 74-year-old Sami Wadi appealed for change ""to save the country"".<br/><br/>""I call on all Iraqis to participate in the elections to prevent those who have controlled the nation since 2003 from staying in power,"" the retiree said.<br/><br/>In Mosul, Iraq's second city and the former ISIS bastion that now lies in ruins after the nine-month battle to oust the group, residents spoke of struggling to put their lives back together.<br/><br/>""I am voting for security and the economy to stabilise and for a better future,"" said 26-year-old labourer Ali Fahmi.<br/><br/>But others saw little point in backing familiar faces who many say have failed to make good on campaign promises. ""Each election is the same - nothing ever changes,"" said Mounes Fauzi, a 27-year-old barber from Baghdad who did not bother to vote.<br/><br/>Ranj Alaaldin, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution suggested that disillusionment was a likely factor in Saturday's turn out.<br/><br/>""There isn't anything particularly refreshing,"" he told The National. ""The usual players that have dominated the political scene are likely to continue their corrupted, dysfunctional rule of the country.

The Prime Minister should directly lead the National Counter Terrorism Authority (NACTA) as terrorism and sectarianism are main threats to the country. The Parliament and Provincial Assemblies should regularly debate and discuss progress on NAP.<br/><br/>Policymakers need to fulfill the governance gaps that are giving space to anti-nationalist forces that, if ignored, may takeroot in Pakistan. The Criminal Justice System needs serious attention and reforms. These were some of the conclusions drawn and recommendations put forward by the Panel Discussion on National Action Plan: Imperatives and Impediments organized by the Islamabad Policy Research Institute, here in Islamabad today.<br/><br/>In his welcome address, Ambassador (R) Abdul Basit, President IPRI, said that during the past three years, there has been a significant decrease in terror attacks in Pakistan. However, there are areas such as social mobilization, regrouping of terror outfits under new names and terror financing which remain key challenges. He outlined that the purpose of the discussion was not only to revisit NAP and review its implementation,but also to identify problem areas and solutions.<br/><br/>Giving an overview of NAP'srationale and the status of implementation of eachof its 20points using the Traffic Light Methodology, Ms. Aasiya Riaz, Joint Director, Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (PILDAT), highlighted that while NAP is a landmark blueprint for combating terrorism and violent extremism in Pakistan(achieved through rare consensus of otherwise bitterly opposed political forces besides being a civil-military agreement),the country is not out of the woods yet.<br/><br/>She outlined that one major issue in this regard is lack of consensus on differentiation between terrorist groups; and lack of a holistic policy on counter-terrorism and national security. Ms Riaz pointed out that another major problem with NAP is the relative opaqueness about its monitoring with there being no clarity on who is chiefly responsible for oversight and implementation -NACTA, National Security Advisor, or the Prime Minister's Office.<br/><br/>She also said that the role and work of the apex committees at the federal and provincial levels for coordination remain nonfunctional, with neither being proactive in sharing implementation status. 'Of all the 20points, revamping of the Criminal Justice System has been the biggest failure under NAP due to continuing lack of initiative by provincial and federal governments in this area,' she stressed. 'For NAP to work, piecemeal approach will never work.Policy andinstitutional reforms need more commitment, especially by the civilian leadership,' she concluded.",ef74862f60db9d89b7118679e4f299aca7055c88f287941394a940aee6ce2f24_6,"In his welcome address, Ambassador (R) Abdul Basit, President IPRI, said that during the past three years, there has been a significant decrease in terror attacks in Pakistan.",0.5360639095306396,16.243075132369995,0

",00819314d076c85edea1cc076e61351b4fad40d1cda4e678fd78fb063036aa41,"(CNN) --  Here's some background information about Ebola, a virus with a high fatality rate that was first identified in Africa in 1976.<br/><br/>Facts: Ebola hemorrhagic fever is a disease caused by one of five different Ebola viruses. Four of the strains can cause severe illness in humans and animals. The fifth, Reston virus, has caused illness in some animals, but not in humans. <br/><br/>The first human outbreaks occurred in 1976, one in northern Zaire (now Democratic Republic of the Congo) in central Africa: and the other, in southern Sudan (now South Sudan). The virus is named after the Ebola River, where the virus was first recognized in 1976, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).<br/><br/>Ebola is extremely infectious but not extremely contagious. It is infectious, because an infinitesimally small amount can cause illness. Laboratory experiments on nonhuman primates suggest that even a single virus may be enough to trigger a fatal infection.<br/><br/>Ebola could be considered moderately contagious because the virus is not transmitted through the air. <br/><br/>Humans can be infected by other humans if they come in contact with body fluids from an infected person or contaminated objects from infected persons. Humans can also be exposed to the virus, for example, by butchering infected animals.<br/><br/>While the exact reservoir of Ebola viruses is still unknown, researchers believe the most likely natural hosts are fruit bats. <br/><br/>Symptoms of Ebola typically include: weakness, fever, aches, diarrhea, vomiting and stomach pain. Additional experiences include rash, red eyes, chest pain, throat soreness, difficulty breathing or swallowing and bleeding (including internal).<br/><br/>Typically, symptoms appear eight to 10 days after exposure to the virus, but the incubation period can span two to 21 days.<br/><br/>Unprotected health care workers are susceptible to infection because of their close contact with patients during treatment.<br/><br/>Ebola is not transmissible if someone is asymptomatic and usually not after someone has recovered from it. However, the virus has been found in semen for up to three months, and ""possibly"" is transmitted from contact with that semen, according to the CDC.<br/><br/>Deadly human Ebola outbreaks have been confirmed in the following countries: Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Gabon, South Sudan, Ivory Coast, Uganda, Republic of the Congo (ROC), Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.<br/><br/>There are five subspecies of the Ebola virus: Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV), Bundibugyo ebolavirus (BDBV), Sudan ebolavirus (SUDV), Taï Forest ebolavirus (TAFV) and Reston ebolavirus (RESTV)<br/><br/>Click here for the CDC's list of known cases and outbreaks. <br/><br/>2014-2016 West Africa Outbreak: (Full historical timeline at bottom)<br/><br/>March 25, 2014 - The CDC issues its initial announcement on an outbreak in Guinea, and reports of cases in Liberia and Sierra Leone. ""In Guinea, a total of 86 suspected cases, including 59 deaths (case fatality ratio: 68.5%), had been reported as of March 24, 2014.
