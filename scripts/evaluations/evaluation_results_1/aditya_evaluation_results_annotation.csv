"Will the Sri Lankan government carry out an execution before 8 September 2018?
",80309,"Pakistan, Aug. 7 -- This weekend heavy protests broke out in Dhaka when a vehicle killed two teenagers. Many young students protested and the government resorted to excessive use of force. The police fired rubber bullets and used tear gas against the protesters. Reportedly, pro-government mobs attacked the peaceful protestors and more than one hundred protesters were injured.

Shahidul Alam was one of the photojournalists who recorded this demonstration. This Sunday evening, he told Al Jazeera that the reason behind the protests was dissatisfaction with the government's performance and not just road safety. On Monday morning, 20 officers in plain clothes abducted Alam from his home. A police officer told AFP that Alam is being interrogated for ""giving false information to different media and for provocative comments.""

Later, he was produced in a court. He told AFP that he was beaten, and his blood-soaked clothes were washed before he appeared in the court.

Bangladesh is currently ranked as number 146 on the World Press Freedom Index. The Reporters Without Borders, an organization that monitors press freedom and safety across the world, raised concerns about the ""endemic violence"" against journalists and the ""systematic impunity"" enjoyed by the violators.

""In Bangladesh, it is a bad idea to criticize the constitution or Islam, although the country is officially secular,"" the report said. The Information and Communication Technology ACT 2006 (ICT Act), under which Shahidul Alam is due to be tried, is controversial, to say the least. The Section 57 of the statute has been allegedly used to harass journalists and activists. This statute punishes ""obscene or false"" information with seven years in prison and heavy fines.

The aggressive crackdown on the protests by youngsters and now the arrest of an internationally acclaimed photojournalist will do the Bangladeshi government no good. Right now, not only the country's reputation but its commitment to democracy is under question. Hopefully, the Bangladeshi government will realise the grave mistake and release Shahidul Alam. *

",1245795,"Pakistan is alarmed after India threatened to take former prime minister Nawaz Sharif's controversial statement on the 2008 Mumbai attacks to the International Court of Justice.

Senior officials at the foreign ministry told The Nation that India was planning to 'play' with the statement in the ICJ: although there were little chances such a plea would be accepted.

One official said: 'They (India) have indicated they might do that (move the ICJ on Sharif's statement). We are alarmed but hopeful that this would not be taken seriously by the ICJ.'

He added: 'Even if the statement (of Sharif) is taken as a big news by India, it is not a compelling evidence. The statement just means an opinion.'

In an interview to an English daily, Sharif had claimed that those who attacked the hotel in Mumbai in 2008 were from Pakistan. Sharif asked if 'we should allow non-state actors 'to cross the border and kill 150 people in Mumbai.' He said: 'Militant organizations are active. Call them non-state actors, should we allow them to cross the border and kill 150 people in Mumbai? Explain it to me. Why can't we complete the trial?'

On Monday, Pakistan's civil and military leadership rejected the statement. The National Security Committee meeting presided over by Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi reviewed the recent statement and unanimously termed it 'incorrect' and 'misleading'.

Legal experts said the ICJ had no jurisdiction to try individuals accused of war crimes or crimes against humanity and as it was not a criminal court it did not have a prosecutor able to initiate proceedings.

Pakistan and India are already fighting convicted Indian spy Kulbushan Jadhav's case in the ICJ.  Pakistan is hopeful the ICJ will ultimately dismiss the Jadhav's case.

Last year, the ICJ asked Pakistan to stay Jadhav's execution until a final verdict. 'Pakistan shall take all measures at its disposal to ensure that Jadhav is not executed pending the final decision in these proceedings,' the ICJ ruled. India had approached the top UN court after Jadhav was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court for his role in terrorism.

The RAW agent was found guilty of conducting espionage activities in the country. Ignoring all evidence, India, however, maintains he was kidnapped from Iran last year. The trial against Jadhav was conducted under the Pakistan Army Act 1952 and Official Secret Act of 1923. Pakistan is expected to file its counter rejoinder on or before July 17 in the ICJ relating to the case of the Indian spy.

After the Mumbai attacks in 2008, a US Republican lawmaker had said that the perpetrators of such crime should be tried by an international tribunal. Edward Randall Royce said those involved in planning these attacks should be transferred to face trial before the international community in The Hague.

Another official at the foreign ministry said the threats from India about moving the ICJ on Sharif's statement was 'hoax'. 'They cannot move this case to the ICJ. This is not the mandate of the ICJ. In fact, the ICJ is not mandated to even hear Jadhav's case,' he insisted.

The official said Pakistan would be ready to defend its case if India did go to the ICJ on the issue. 'We can't stop them (from moving the ICJ) but we know it is not a case for the ICJ,' he said.

Tensions between Pakistan and India have been high since the killing of a Kashmiri freedom fighter Burhan Wani in July 2016. An attack on Indian forces in September 2016: that killed 19 soldiers in Uri area of held Kashmir: further heightened the tensions. India also claimed it had carried a 'surgical strike' to avenge the Uri attack. Pakistan rejected the Indian claim.

Reports said that cross-border clashes between nuclear-armed Pakistan and India had reached the highest levels in 15 years. Hundreds of people have been killed or wounded in the clashes instigated by India. The nuclear-armed neighbours have fought three wars since gaining independence from the British in 1947.",19,"Pakistan shall take all measures at its disposal to ensure that Jadhav is not executed pending the final decision in these proceedings,' the ICJ ruled.",0.46808737516403204,4.849451541900635,1

",582587,"India, Aug. 10 -- The Centre told the Supreme Court it does not concur with the Tamil Nadu government's proposal to release seven convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, saying remission of their sentence will set a ""dangerous precedent"" and have ""international ramifications"".

A bench of justices Ranjan Gogoi, Navin Sinha and K M Joseph took the document, filed by the Ministry of Home Affairs, on record and adjourned the matter.

On January 23, the apex court had asked the Centre to take a decision within three months on a 2016 letter by the Tamil Nadu government seeking its concurrence on releasing the seven convicts.

The letter, written on March 2, 2016, had said the state government has already decided to release the seven convicts, but it is necessary to seek the Centre's concurrence as per an apex court order of 2015.

""The central government, in pursuance of section 435 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, does not concur to the proposal of the government of Tamil Nadu contained in its communication letter dated March 2, 2016 for grant of further remission of sentence to these seven convicts,"" said the reply filed by MHA Joint Secretary V B Dubey.

The ministry said the trial court had given ""cogent reasons"" for imposing death penalty upon the accused and pointed out that even the Supreme Court had termed the assassination an ""unparallel act"" in the annals of crimes committed in this country.

"". Releasing the four foreign nationals who had committed the gruesome murder of former prime minister of this country, along with 15 others most of whom were police officers, in connivance with three Indian nationals will set a very dangerous precedent and lead to international ramifications by other such criminals in the future,"" the Centre said.

Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated on the night of May 21, 1991 at Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu by a woman suicide bomber, identified as Dhanu, at an election rally. Fourteen others, including Dhanu herself, were also killed.

This was perhaps the first case of suicide bombing which had claimed the life of a high-profile global leader.

The MHA in its reply said that the case involves the assassination of a former prime minister in a brutal manner in pursuance of a ""diabolical"" plot carefully conceived and executed by a foreign terrorist organisation.

It said the assassination brought the democratic process in the country to a ""grinding halt"" as elections to the Lok Sabha and some state assemblies had to be postponed.

Convicts V Sriharan alias Murugan, T Suthendraraja alias Santham, A G Perarivalan alias Arivu, Jayakumar, Robert Payas, P Ravichandaran and Nalini have been in jail for 25 years.

The Supreme Court had on February 18, 2014, commuted the death sentence of three convicts - Murugan, Santhan and Perarivalan - citing inordinate delay by the executive in deciding their mercy plea.

A day after on February 19, 2014, the then J Jayalalitha government in Tamil Nadu wrote a letter to the then UPA government at the Centre seeking its opinion on the remission of the sentences awarded to all the seven convicts.

Instead of giving its opinion, the Centre had rushed to the Supreme Court claiming itself as the competent authority to decide on remission and not the state government, under the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

The apex court on February 21, 2014, passed an interim order and stayed the release of all seven convicts in the case and referred the matter to a five-judge constitution bench.

The Centre had asserted that the killers of the former prime minister did not deserve any mercy as the assassination was the result of a conspiracy involving foreign nationals.

The Tamil Nadu government, on the other hand, had said that the states have power to grant remission under the law and trashed the accusations that its decision to release the seven convicts was ""political and arbitrary"".

On December 2, 2015, the constitution bench held that the Centre has ""primacy"" over state's right to grant remission and its ""concurrence"" is necessary before freeing the convicts in certain cases.

",424054,"Dhanbad: The judicial ceasework by 3,000 lawyers, in protest against the arrest of a colleague who is accused of molesting a minor, was called off on Thursday after advocate-general Ajit Kumar visited the coal town and promised a ""fair inquiry"".

Advocate Ashwini Kumar, a resident of Purana Bazaar, was taken into custody in the small hours of April 28, allegedly in a show of police high-handedness, after the 13-year-old girl's family lodged a complaint. Civil court work had remained suspended since May 2 after Kumar's colleagues announced their indefinite strike.

A day after Jharkhand High Court termed the form of protest ""illegal and unconstitutional"", the advocate-general met office-bearers of Dhanbad Bar Association.

Ajit Kumar held a second round of talks with deputy commissioner A. Dodde, SSP Manoj Ratan Chothe and others at Circuit House, and a third round of talks with lawyers staging a dharna on civil court premises. The Bar association, under the chairmanship of president Radheyshyam Goswami, thereafter took a decision to end the strike.

""All issues have been resolved amicably. On behalf of the state government, an impartial probe has been promised (into the arrest of Ashwini Kumar). The process will begin with a proper police inquiry, as assured by the SSP,"" the advocate-general said.

Disgruntled lawyers had been demanding a judicial probe and Ajit Kumar said that would be the next step, if needed.

Bar president Goswami said lawyers would join work from Friday. But, association general secretary Bidesh Kumar Dan warned that they would not hesitate to resume protest if ""sentiments of lawyers is hurt"".",10,"The process will begin with a proper police inquiry, as assured by the SSP,"" the advocate-general said.

",614594,"Post-IndependenceFollowing elections in April 1962, Milton Obote, leader of the Uganda People's Congress, or UPC, became the first prime minister of independent Uganda.  The country gained independence from Britain in October 1962.In succeeding years, Obote and the UPC supported the creation of a strong centralized state. Opposition groups, principally those associated with pre-colonial Bantu monarchies, favored a loose federation and a strong role for tribally based local kingdoms. This issue was particularly salient in the region of Buganda.

Political maneuvering climaxed in February 1966 when Prime Minister Obote suspended the constitution, assumed all government powers and removed the ceremonial head of state (the Kabaka) from office. In September 1967, Obote and the UPC promulgated a new constitution that proclaimed Uganda a republic, gave the president greater powers, abolished the traditional kingdoms and sent the Kabaka into exile.Idi Amin  Dissatisfaction with Obote's rule, especially concerning his insistence on centralization of power, decreased his popularity. This situation created an opening for the armed forces commander, Idi Amin, to oust Obote's government in a military coup on Jan. 25, 1971. Amin declared himself president, dissolved the parliament, and amended the constitution to give him absolute power.  Idi Amin's eight-year rule produced severe economic decline, social disintegration and massive human rights violations. The Acholi and Langi tribes were particular objects of Amin's political persecution because Obote and many of his supporters belonged to those tribes. In 1978, the International Commission of Jurists estimated that more than 100,000 Ugandans had been murdered during Amin's reign; some authorities place the figure much higher.  In October 1978, Tanzanian armed forces repulsed an incursion of Amin's troops into Tanzanian territory. In retaliation for Uganda's invasion, the Tanzanian army, backed by Ugandan exiles, waged a war of liberation against Amin. On April 11, 1979, Kampala was captured and Amin fled with his remaining forces.The 1980s  After Amin's removal, the Uganda National Liberation Front, or UNLF, a loose assemblage of anti-Amin politicians, formed an interim government with Yusuf Lule as president. This government adopted a ministerial system of administration and created a quasi-parliamentary organ known as the National Consultative Commission, or NCC. The NCC and the Lule cabinet reflected widely differing political views.  In June 1979, following a dispute over the extent of presidential powers, the NCC replaced Pre sident Lule with Godfrey Binaisa. In a continuing dispute over the powers of the interim presidency, Binaisa was also removed in May 1980. Thereafter, a military commission chaired by Paulo Muwanga ruled Uganda.The December 1980 elections returned the UPC to power under the leadership of President Obote. However, widespread irregularities in the election process led many observers to question the election's legitimacy.In early 1981, to protest the results of the election, Yoweri Museveni and his National Resistance Army, or NRA, began a guerrilla war to oust Obote and the UPC from power. In their efforts to stamp out the NRA insurgency, Obote's army laid waste to a substantial section of the country, especially in the Luwero area north of Kampala. Under Obote, Ugandan security forces had one of the world's worst human rights records.Obote ruled until July 27, 1985, when an army brigade, composed mostly of Acholi tr oops and commanded by Lt. Gen. Basilio Olara-Okello, took Kampala and proclaimed a military government. Obote fled to exile in Zambia.The new regime, headed by former Defense Force Commander Gen. Tito Okello (no relation to Lt. Gen. Olara-Okello), opened negotiations with the NRA. In the meantime, massive human rights violations continued as the Okello government murdered civilians and ravaged the countryside in order to destroy the NRA's support.Negotiations between the Okello government and the NRA were conducted in Nairobi in the fall of 1985, with Kenyan President Daniel Moi seeking a cease-fire and a coalition government in Uganda. Although agreeing in late 1985 to a cease-fire, the NRA continued fighting, seized Kampala in late January 1986, and assumed control of the country forcing Okello to flee north into Sudan. Museveni's forces organized a government with Museveni as president. Museveni formed a cabinet in February 1986 comprised of members from several political groups, but mostly from the National Resistance Army and the political arm of the NRA, the National Resistance Movement.Two important political initiatives marked the early years of Museveni's power. The first was the establishment of the NRM as an alternative to political parties as a means of organizing political expression. Under the ""movement"" system, all Ugandans are assumed to be members of the movement and elections are contested on the basis of the candidate's personal qualities rather than on the basis of party affiliation.Although the NRM government in Uganda is a de facto single party state, political parties are not illegal. The old political parties, principally the UPC and the Democratic Party, or DP, are allowed to maintain national headquarters and to publish newspapers, but they are not allowed to organize public gatherings or to organize election camp aigns. The second significant political initiative of the early NRM years concerned the establishment of the Resistance Council, or RC, system. The RC system was a six-stage pyramid of committees that originated with direct elections at the lowest level. An electoral college consisting of all committee members from the next lower level indirectly elected all committees above the lowest level. The first NRM government also promised that national elections would be held by 1989.The first years of the NRM government were notable for the improved security situation in Western, Central and much of Eastern Uganda. However, anti-government insurgencies, as well as the government's efforts to quell the insurgents, contributed to political and economic disruption in northern Uganda. The early years of NRM were also marked by a rapidly expanding economy and the government's embrace of neo-liberal economic policies recommended by donor nations and international financial institutions notably the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.The first national elections under the new government were held in February 1989. Uganda's legislative body during this period, the National Resistance Council, or NRC, was expanded to 278 members, with 210 positions open for election. President Museveni appointed the remaining seats. At this time, a committee to draft a new constitution was also established. In a controversial move, in October 1989, the NRC extended the NRM's mandate to govern for another five-year period.The 1990sThe 1994 national elections were held for a Constituent Assembly, or CA, to revise and approve a new constitution for Uganda. These elections, widely acknowledged to have been conducted on a free and fair basis, produced an assembly dominated by supporters of the NRM. The most significant issue facing the CA concerned whether or not the new constitution would allow open political competition in a multi-party system, or retain the movement system that severely limits the activities of political parties.The final version of the constitution, promulgated in September 1995, allowed for a national referendum to be held in the year 2000 to decide whether to maintain the non-party movement system, or adopt a multi-party political system.The first presidential elections under the new constitution were held in May 1996. Yoweri Museveni took 74.2 percent of the vote followed by Paul Ssemogerere of the Democratic Party with 23.7 percent and Kibirig Mayanga with 2.1 percent. Legislative elections followed in June, with the NRM securing most of the 214 elected seats. The rest of the 276 seats (reduced from 278) were reserved for nominated representatives of the army, disabled population, youth and 39 seats for women from each of the 39 districts.Elections of 2001The second presidential elections under the movement system were held on March 12, 2001. Yoweri Museveni won with 69.3 percent followed in a distant second by Dr. Kizza Besigye with 27.8 percent and Aggrey Siryoyi Awori with 1.4 percent. There was a slight decline in Museveni's popularity. Despite the fact that in the June 2001 parliamentary elections multiparty activists doubled their parliamentary strength, Museveni's all embracing movement was still dominant.The elections were highly controversial, marked by violence, intimidation and extensive cheating. However, while politically-motivated efforts did tarnish the Museveni's international reputation as a statesmen, the elections appear to have been lost by the inept organization of the opposition as much as they were won by Museveni. Post-election violence was prevalent in sev eral towns, most notable Kasese. Human Rights abuses continued for more than a month while some opposition leaders were harassed. Col. Besigye was ordered not to leave the country. He filed a petition challenging the election to which President Museveni filed a defense.Politics, Parties and PowerAt the beginning of 2002, the most prominent domestic political issue continued to revolve around the question of what kind of political system was appropriate for Uganda. President Museveni and the NRM government argued that Uganda was not sufficiently politically mature to support a multiparty political system. The regime associates political parties with Uganda's history of political instability that led to political and economic decay in Uganda. President Museveni and the NRM suggested that political parties in Uganda base their support on ethnic, regional and religious affili ation, all factors that tend to exacerbate political divisions rather than contributing to political compromise and national unity. Museveni and the NRM have thusly favored a ""non-party"" system that in theory overcomes the potential for political division in Uganda's plural society.Opposition leaders have favored returning Uganda to a multiparty political system. The opposition pointed out that the regime's restrictions on political association violate basic human rights. Kizza Bessigye, who was President Museveni's main challenger in the March presidential elections, has argued that continued suffocation of political parties has undermined the legitimacy of the movement system and killed the principles of democracy and individual rights.Many international observers have been sympathetic to the opposition's rights-based arguments, but most donors and the international financial institutions have continued to support t he government of Museveni due to its relatively successful economic program and the government's record for having improved the general security situation in most of the country.In the earlier June 2000 referendum held to determine whether Uganda should keep the movement system or change to a multiparty system, both government and opposition leaders claimed victory in the referendum. The government claimed victory because over 90 percent of voters supported the movement form of government. However, the opposition, which called for voters to boycott the election, also claimed victory because turnout for the election was relatively light (around 50 percent of eligible voters). Thus, the government did not gain enthusiastic endorsement for its movement system, but it did gain a wide margin of approval among people who went to the polls. The question of how to organize Ugandan politics, whether under the de facto single party movement system, or unde r a multiparty system, is the key issue in Ugandan politics for the foreseeable future.In this regard, party politicians, most people in northern Uganda and most elites (both foreign and domestic) favor a return to multiparty politics, while the government and its patrons, as well as most of the rural population of southern Uganda continue to support the movement system.Despite the half-hearted endorsement the movement system received in the June 2000 political system referendum, President Museveni and the NRM continued to dominate Ugandan politics. Since 1986, the NRM government's legitimacy was based on an expanding economy and provision of relatively good security for most Ugandans. Save for limits on democratic participation imposed by the government, the NRM government's record remained strong, especially in comparison with other post-independence governments in Uganda. However, declining levels of economic gr owth, government corruption scandals and foreign policy entanglements have tarnished the government's reputation and emboldened the government's critics.Indeed, in December 1998, the World Bank charged that Uganda was one of the most corrupt countries in the world. Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index rated Uganda 87 on a scale in which a score of one is least corrupt and a score of 100 is most corrupt which confirmed this evaluation. Again, in its 2001 report Transparency International rated Uganda as one of the 10 most corrupt nations in the world. The 2002 report suggested little movement for Uganda's rating from the previous year, as it was featured once again as one of the 10 most corrupt nations in the world. (Editor's Note: In the last year, Uganda's rating was 102 on a scale of 1 to 145.)It was estimated that approximately $300 million is drained from the country every year due to the misuse of funds. Several reasons were outlined for this behavior including low salaries, poor supervision and lack of job security. Several government ministers were implicated in embezzlement and were either sacked or shuffled within the cabinet. The vice president, Specioza Kazibwe, in her capacity as minister of agriculture, was implicated in a scandal in which more than three million dollars was unaccounted for in a massive dam construction project. As such, corruption in government has become a significant political liability for the NRM regime.A more favorable domestic issue for the current government was its sweeping reforms to enhance education. A Universal Primary Education, or UPE, program, implemented in 1997, doubled primary school enrollment. Another program was in the planning stage and, like the UPE, would focus on increasing enrollment and constructing school facilities.In addition to UPE, the Ugandan government continued to work to eradicate poverty and increase employment throughout the country. In addition to millions of dollars in donations and loans from foreign entities, the government has significantly increased its financial commitment to this effort. In the budget for 1999-2000, the Poverty Action Fund was increased by 85 percent to $110 million dollars. Areas of development for this fund include improving the infrastructure and encouraging local manufacturing operations. These measures are significant since it is estimated that 42 percent of the Ugandan population lives under the poverty line.However, government efforts to stimulate the economy have not resulted in significant improvements for the majority of Ugandans. Indeed, for most Ugandans, the government's programs of privatization of government-owned industries and a mild economic downturn over the past two years have resulted in economic hardship. Symptomatic of th e economic difficulties is the fact that several major banks closed in 1999 due to employee fraud and bad debts. In April 1999, the Greenland Bank, Ltd. was shut down due to bad debts and insolvency. The following month The Cooperative Bank closed. The closing of these major banks resulted in a rush by depositors in the Housing Finance Company of Uganda to withdraw all of their money. The closing of the banks, in addition to declining coffee exports, resulted in plummeting value of the Ugandan shilling against the dollar.After about 15 years in office,  Museveni and the NRM had lost some of their luster, but they maintain a firm grip on power. The  balance of power favored the NRM regime, but this balance appeared to rely on the leadership qualities of President Museveni. But, according to the 1995 constitution, Museveni would not be allowed to stand for a third term as president in 2006 and without Museveni as leader of the NRM, prosp ects for a continuation of the movement in power appeared problematic.Still, by the early 2000s, the NRM managed to achieve complete political dominance on one hand, and a restriction on the opposition on the other hand, along with the occasional harassments of opposition parties. According to Amnesty International, the Ugandan government created an increasingly hostile environment for opposition politicians since President Museveni was re-elected in 2001.Following the elections, in August 2001, Besigye -- who came second in the elections as noted above -- fled to the U.S. after security forces hounded him and twice prevented him from leaving the country. Also, in August 2001, the government harassed Winnie Banyima, an MP of Mbarara town who is also the wife of Besigye.Rebels, Resistance and Human RightsThere were, a s well, rebel forces opposed to NRM government in many areas of Uganda. These have included the West Nile Bank Front, Uganda National Rescue Front II, the Lord Resistance Army operating in northern Uganda from Sudanese area bases and the Allied Democratic Forces operating in the Ruwenzori Mountains in western Uganda. In Eastern Uganda, rebel groups include the Anti Referendum Army, the Uganda Salvation Army and the Citizen's Army for Multiparty Politics. According to Human Rights Watch, conflicts between these forces and the military have led to charges of serious human rights abuses, including arbitrary arrests and detention and torture. In some cases the use of excessive force is applied when civilians refuse to comply with orders to move into ""protected camps."" On the other side of the equation, human rights abuses have been recorded in the ranks of the rebel and resistance movements.Another related issue to abuse of civilian population has been th e abduction of children by rebel groups operating in western and northern Uganda. This concern led the United Nations Commission on Human Rights to adopt a resolution on the abduction of children in northern Uganda during its 1999 session.As far as the international donor community was concerned, there was a notable change in attitude. Increasingly, it became critical of the no-party system, as well as Uganda's involvement in the neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo, which has led to increased defense spending, and lack of fundamental human rights. Still, with notable movements toward peace and stability advanced by mid-2002, it was hoped that much of this external critique might be alleviated.Meanwhile, several human rights organizations have remained active in Uganda and have shown remarkable interest in human rights matters in the country. However, the government continued to control civil societ y through a registration process by which civil organizations are required to be registered as non-sectarian and non-political.In October 2002, Uganda's political and human rights situation took a nosedive as resistance rebels killed at least 52 villagers in northern Uganda, according to the army. The rebels in question were the Lord's Resistance Army, which has been in conflict with the government. The resistance rebels intensified their violent attacks in 2002, especially in northern Uganda. The resistance rebels have been known to carry out revenge killings against deserters and their families; they also have a record of abducting civilians, regardless of gender, for military use in their resistance efforts, or in the case of females, to function as sex slaves for rebel commanders.The Ugandan army has stated that it will crush the resistance movement, which, as noted above, is allegedly supported by forces in the Sudan. By March 2003, more conflict spurred by Lord's Resistance Army had ensued.Meanwhile, in late December 2002, the government signed a peace deal with the Uganda National Rescue Front (UNRF) rebels after more than five years of negotiations. The rebels had been calling for conditions that the government could not accept such as the absorption of all rebels into the Ugandan army, and at least one ministerial post. In the peace deal that was finally reached, about 700 of the rebels would be integrated into the Ugandan army while the remainder would be given resettlement packages, including cash. The total cost of the peace deal for the Ugandan government was estimated to be more than US$2 million.Central African CrisisOriginally backers of the former president, Laurent Kabila, who took power in the Democratic Republic o f Congo (DRC) in mid-1997, both Uganda and Rwanda have supported anti-Kabila rebels in the DRC since 1998. Uganda's interest in the region stemmed from disappointment with the DRC's ability to control its eastern borders. In the late 1990s and continuing to date, rebel factions mounted attacks on Western Uganda from bases in Eastern DRC. The rebel factions included, the Islamic fundamentalist/Hutu group, the Allied Democratic Front, or ADF, and the West Nile Bank Front, or WNBF. In addition, lack of security in Western Uganda hurt Uganda's small, but potentially lucrative tourism industry. An Interhamwe Rwandan rebel group carried out attacks from bases in the DRC against border towns in 1999 and was blamed for the abduction and murder of tourists in the Bwindi National Park in Southwest Uganda in  1999. Also in 1999, ADF rebels killed 80 students in the western region, earning the group strong condemnation from the U.N.Initially justified as a means of elim inating cross-border incursions, the Ugandan military has extended its influence in the DRC by supporting a political faction in DRC politics. Although Uganda's efforts to control its Western frontier have been moderately successful, the NRM government's political reputation has suffered from its presence in the DRC due declining relations between Rwanda and Uganda. Rwanda and Uganda back opposing factions in the ongoing civil war in the DRC, and the countries' forces in the DRC have clashed repeatedly over the past years. In addition, the expense of maintaining forces in the DRC has become a political issue in domestic politics as opposition politicians criticize the government for expending scarce resources maintaining Uganda's military presence in the DRC. Uganda's involvement in the DRC is also an issue in Uganda's relations with donor groups who are reluctant to help Uganda finance foreign wars. The 2002 peace agreement between the two countries, however, was hoped to help assu age the international community.  By 2003, however, ongoing violence, including repprts of massacres, included charges against various pro-government forces in the region and allied militias.  The United Nations mission in Congo DRC confirmed that violent confrontations had occurred. The mission also stated that while it did not have an actual estimate of the number of people killed, the reported high numbers were plausible. Rebel leaders accused Uganda and a Rwandan-backed group of being complicit in the killings, although Ugandan and the Rwandan cadres disputed the claim.Meanwhile, the Ugandan army remained in the Congo DRC, presumably to deal with cross-border issues. As such, the Rwandan government, which had withdrawn its forces under the previous year's peace agreement, now threatened to return to DRC. Both Rwanda and Uganda said that their involvement in DRC has been for the purpose of maintaining regional stability, and, indeed, were former allies in this regard. Their troops, however, have become increasingly antagonistic to one another.Nevertheless, in May 2003, Uganda pulled out the last of its troops from eastern DRC as the latest part of a plan to return control of DRC to its people after four years of war. The United Nations had asked Uganda to keep some troops there to maintain law and order but then accused Ugandan soldiers of plundering DRC's resources. As a result, Uganda had been under international pressure to withdraw. Tens of thousands of DRC civilians were reported to have sought asylum in Uganda.Political Developments between 2003 and 2006On a more local level, the government's decision-making body recommended lifting a 17-year-ban on political party activity in March 2003. Traditionally, political parties have been severely restricted and an arrangement know as the ""Movement"" system has been in place. However, Uganda's National Executive Committee recommended that political parties be free to operate, subject to a referendum in 2004. If implemented this recommendation would end more than 17 years of severe restrictions on political parties in Uganda.By late July 2003, the United Nation's World Food Programme (WFP) announced that food aid was urgently needed for more than 1.6 million people in northern and eastern Uganda in the worst humanitarian crisis the country has seen for years. Over one million people were at that time displaced by the ongoing conflict with the rebel Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) in the north, not all of whom were accessible by humanitarian workers. The fear of abductions by the LRA, killings and looting have also severely hampered people's ability to produce, or even buy food. While foodstocks were available for August, WFP estimated there would be a ""pipeline crisis"" by September.Former Ugandan dictator Idi Amin died in exile in a hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia in August 2003. Some 2,000 people attended a religious service in Uganda for the former dictator despite President Museveni's declaration that he was not in mourning for Amin and would not grant Amin a state funeral.In 2003 and 2004, Uganda was continually plagued by horrific violence at the hands of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA). The LRA killed 10 civilians in Apac and 20 members of a civilian militia, the Arrow Group, in the east in September 2003. More than 80 civilians were killed in Lira in October and November.  This trend continued throughout 2004.  The apex of the violence was reached when the LRA executed more than 190 civilians at a refugee camp in the northern part of the country in February 2004. The massacre included attacks on civilians as they attempted to flee. Many people in a camp near the town of Lira were forced into their huts, which were then torched leaving the people inside to be burned alive. The victims of these deadly attacks included one soldier, five government militiamen, as well as several children. In another massacre at a refugee camp, also near Lira, rebels disguised themselves as Ugandan soldiers and after infiltrating the area, killed about 50 people.  At the end of 2003, the United Nations Under Secretary for Humanitarian Affairs called Uganda one of the worst humanitarian situations in the world.The government response to the attacks by the LRA has been widely condemned.  While the government had reported killing a few dozen rebels and reportedly freed several hundred abductees, little tangible progress was made against the LRA for much of 2004.  Thirty-four MPs walked out of parliament over the government's inaction concerning the LRA in November 2003.  In April 2004, President Museveni offered peace t alks if the rebels would lay down their weapons.  Little progress was made however until 300 LRA fighters accepted the governments offer of amnesty and joined the Ugandan armed forces.In January 2004, the government of Uganda appealed to the International Criminal Court to investigate war crimes at the hands of the LRA.  The  ICC began a war crimes investigation in July 2004.By the close of 2004, tensions were renewed between combative neighbors Rwanda, Uganda  and Democratic Republic of the Congo.  Rwandan and Ugandan troops clashed as they crossed into the territory  of the Democratic Republic of Congo.  Rwanda's presence in the area was purportedly to flush out Interahamwe militia who crossed over the border.  Rwanda was trying to negotiate for joint operations with Congo to manage the rebels, but  threatened to mount attacks alone if the Congolese government did not cooperate.  For its part, Uganda deployed its troops after receiving reports that Rwandan troops were operating in the area and had crossed over into Congolese territory.On Sept. 30, 2005, the deadline expired for the exodus from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) of foreign militias.  The Congolese government in Kinshasa promised to act against any militias remaining in the country, and against any new invasions by outside forces.Observers said that ever since President Joseph Kabila issued the ultimatum earlier in September, however, there was no sign of compliance by militias from countries like  Rwanda and Uganda.  Indeed, Uganda issued its own threats against Lord's Resistance Army rebels, which are known to operate from within the DRC.  In part, Uganda has explained the presence of the rebels operating from strongholds in the DRC as its rationale for crossing the border. Indeed, a day before the expiration of President Kabila's deadline, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni emphatically promised that his military would enter the DRC if rebels from the Lord's Resistance Army were not disarmed.The presence of Ugandan and Rwandan rebels and military in the DRC has often been associated with sparking the Congolese civil war which as brought officially to an end via the 2002  peace deal.  However, despite the official existence of the peace agreement, there is little control over the eastern part of the DRC where rebel groups and militias have run rampant. Presumably, part of the problem faced by the government of the DRC has been the poor state of the country's military, with some soldiers leaving the ranks to join rebel groups. The presence of close to 20,000 peacekeeping forces from the United Nations has also had a limited effect on restoring normalcy to the DRC.Meanwhile, in August 2005, following the death of former rebel leader and Sudanese Vice President, John Garang, in a helicopter crash, a Ugandan radio journalist was charged with sedition.  The Ugandan government said that the arrest of Andrew Mwenda had taken place because of the risk of genocide at a time when ethnic tensions were heightened.  Even though Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni warned the media not to report speculation about the crash, Mwenda voiced controversial views about Garang's death. In response, Information Minister, Nsaba Buturo, warned that national and regional security had been compromised by the airing of conspiracy theories about the Sudanese Vice President's death. Mwenda later apologized for his inappropriate remarks.  Since Mwenda was only one of many media figures espousing intemperate remarks, and because controversial conspiracy theories were running rampant throughout Uganda's media, opposition leaders accused the government of going too far. They were particularly critical of the decision to temporarily close down the radio station where Mwenda worked.In October 2005, the International Criminal Court (ICC) complete an investigation into alleged atrocities committed by the notorious Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) and issued the indictments of the group's five senior leaders.  The war crimes charges included murder, rape, and forcible enlistment of children.  The five individuals indicted included Joseph Kony, the leader of the LRA, as well as Raska Lukwiya, Vincent Otti, Okot Odhiambo and Dominic Ongwen. All five were yet to be apprehended. According to the ICC, it would be Uganda's responsibility to ensure that all five individuals were brought into custody to face trial.In November 2005, opposition leader, Kizza Besigye, was arrested after returning from exile on charges of treason due to his links with key rebel groups.  In response, Besigye denied having any connection to the rebel groups at issue, such as the Lord's Resistance Army and the People's Redemption Army. Opposition politicians said that Besigye's arrest, which came following a rally in the capital city of Kampala, was intended to prevent him from contesting the presidential election scheduled for March 2006.  Indeed, Besigye, who had once been President Museveni's doctor, has been viewed as a strong challenger to the president. He was registered as a candidate with the Forum for Democratic Change (FDC). As thousands of his supporters gathered outside the police station where he was being held, police used tear gas to disperse the crowd.  The chaos outside the police turned violent with clashes between the protestors and authorities.A week after the unrest involving Besigye's arrest began, President Museveni said that he would contest  the next elections, despite the expectation that he would step down from office after being in power for close to 20 years.In December 2005, the country's election commission said that arrested opposition leader, Kizza Besigye, could contest the presidential elections. The decision came after the Attorney General said he should be barred from running because his candidacy was ""tainted with illegalities"" -- an apparent reference to charges of  treason, terrorism and rape that led to Besigye's arrest.  But the opposition leader argued that these very charges, as well as his arrest, had been orchestrated specifically for the purpose of stopping him from running for the presidency in 2006.  The decision by the election commission cleared one hurdle for Besigye, however, with the High Court declining to order his release from prison, and with a decisions yet to be made by the Constitutional Court, it was unclear whether or not he would be legally able to stand for election from behind bars. Besigye has been linked with violent rebel groups operating in Uganda -- another charge he denies -- and has said that his desire is to end the rule of President Yoweri Museven, which he has characterized as a ""dictatorship.""On December 19, 2005, Besigye pled not guilty to charges of treason and rape at the High Court. The trials were then delayed until January 2006, which meant that it was possible that they would not be completed before the elections set for February 2006.  On the other hand, if the trials were completed and he were to be convicted, Besigye would be barred from contesting the election. Besigye was also due to face a separate court-martial on charges of terrorism and weapons offences.Uganda's High Court released Besigye on bail a month later.Following his release on bail, the judge said that the extension of a military warrant keeping Besigye in jail was illegal and as such, his release was ordered. Following his release, thousands of his supporters celebrated in the streets of the capital city of Kampala.  Although their activities were reported to have been peaceful, police fired tear gas to disperse the crowds.  The court ruling presented a temporary victory for Besigye since the country's military can still re-arrest him on the grounds that its own court is not subordinate to the High Court of the country.Meanwhile in December 2005, the International Court of Justice  ruled in favor of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in a case about the invasion of Congolese territory by Uganda during the war in Central Africa that took place between 1998 and 2003, and which left millions dead. The DRC accused Uganda -- and other African neighbors such as Rwanda and Burundi -- of invading its territory and killing civilians.  In response, Uganda and the other African countries have said that its entered Congolese territory only to pursue rebels operating across the border. Although Uganda withdrew its troops in 2003, the DRC has said that the Ugandan military still operates across the border.  The court orderd Uganda to pay compensation to the Democratic Republic of Congo for exploitation of that country's natural resources -- gold, diamonds and timber -- during that period. The court also found Uganda responsible for human rights abuses. The government in Kinshasa said that it would seek between $6bn and $10bn in compensation from Uganda.Also in  late December 2005, the Ugandan army killed seven civilians and injured 16 people in a spate of violence near Gulu in the northern part of the country.  The incident occurred in a camp where the  victims had taken refuge from attacks by  the notorious rebel group, the Lord's Resistance Army. The shooting apparently occurred after they protested the death of a youth who had been misidentified as a rebel and killed.Special Entry: International Aid and Debt ReliefOn June 11, 2005, at a pre-G8 summit meeting in London, world leaders agreed to write off $40 billion in debt owed by the world's poorest countries. Under the plan, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the African Development Fund would write off 100 percent of the money owed to them by 18 countries. In about a year to 18 months, another nine countries would also benefit from debt relief.  Then, eleven other countries would be eligible for such relief, provided that they successfully dealt with corruption and met targets for good governance.  With those additional two phases, the entire plan would involve $55 billion in debt relief.The countries benefiting immediately from the plan expressed gratitude that they would no longer be saddled with debilitating debt and that they could, instead, work toward economic development. Anti-poverty activists also expressed support for the plan but said that more countries should also be able to benefit.With the plan for debt relief agreed upon, British Prime Minister Tony Blair traveled to Moscow on  June 12, 2005, for another meeting in a series of pre-G8 summit talks with world leaders.  On the agenda were matters such as African aid and development, as well as transnational measures to deal with climate change. The United Kingdom, which holds the presidency of the G8 grouping of the world's eight wealthiest countries, was hoping to advance a significant increase in developmental aid to help benefit the world's most impoverished countries, especially in Africa.Editor's Note: Twenty-seven countries, which are eligible for debt relief under the HIPC (highly-indebted poor countries initiative), are listed following, with the 18 countries qualifying for immediate debt relief identified by asterisk: Benin*, Bolivia*, Burkina Faso*, Cameroon, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana*, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Guyana*, Honduras*, Madagascar*, Malawi, Mali*, Mauritania*, Mozambique*, Nicaragua*, Niger*, Rwanda*, Sao Tome, Senegal*, Sierra Leone, Tanzania*, Uganda*, and Zambia*Elections of 2006In mid-February 2006, multi-party presidential and parliamentary elections ensued in Uganda with long lines of voters waiting to cast their ballots.  Turnout was about 68 percent despite heavy rainfall at outdoor polling stations. There were some complaints by voters that their names were missing from electoral rolls, however, the elections appeared to have transpired in a peaceful manner.In the presidential race, incumbent President Yoweri Museveni was one of five candidates.  Museveni was criticized for changing the constitution to allow him to contest the election after being in power for two decades.  Still, he has been viewed as a popular and effective African leader with a record of higher living standards and improved security conditions in Uganda -- a sharp contrast to the years of rule under the likes of Idi Amin and Milton Obote.Museveni's main opponent was Dr. Kizza Besigye, who was arrested and charged with  treason and rape in 2005. Bisigye has said that he was the target of undue harassment leading up to the election.These charges notwithstanding, both Museveni and Besigye appeared to be in a close contest, according to opinion polls.  With two-thirds of the votes counted, results showed the president with a commanding lead of 63 percent.  Besigye had 34 percent.  In order to win an outright majority, a candidate would have to cross the 50 percent threshold, or face a run-off election with the other top vote-getter.By late February 2006, with all the votes counted, Museveni was re-elected for a third term with a clear margin of victory -- 59 percent of the vote cast.  Besigye garnered 37 percent of the vote, according to the Electoral Commission.  The parliamentary elections, Museveni's cadre showed less impressive results with some members of Museveni's government losing their seats.Besigye rejected the presidential election results and accused the authorities of massive fraud.  Specific charges included irregularities in the conduct of the polls, the attempted intimidation of voters via the deployment of soldiers near voting booths, and the exclusion of names from electoral rolls.  In these regards, the opposition leader told reporters, ""The FDC [Forum for Democratic Change] has taken a decision to reject the results."" There was some speculation about contesting the results in court. Meanwhile,  his supporters took to the streets of the capital city of Kampala, spurring clashes with police outside the headquarters of the FDC.There was, however, no major violence.For its part, the ruling National Resistance Movement (NRM) denied the allegations of fraud. Ofwono Opondo, the spokesman for the NRM characterized called the opposition as ""bad losers.""War Crimes and Peace TalksIn May 2006, the International Criminal Court warned that Uganda had to fulfill its obligations to arrest the five individuals from the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) who had been indicted in 2005 on war crimes charges including rape and murder. Included in the list of those indicted was LRA leader, Joseph Kony (as noted above).  For his part, President Museveni responded to the reminder by offering Kony a peace deal.  He said that Kony and the LRA had until the end of July to end and war and, in so doing, his safety would be guaranteed.  The ICC noted that because it was the Ugandan government which referred the case to the court in the first place, it was incumbent upon Uganda to honor its commitment to apprehend all five individual indicted on war crimes charges.In early June 2006, the international police agency, INTERPOL, issued wanted notices for the five indicted individuals (including Kony) on behalf of the ICC.  It was the first such set of notices issued by INTERPOL ever.

Later in June 2006, Kony was reported to have said that he and the LRA were not involved in any of the atrocities he and his group is alleged to have carried out, and indeed, have been charged with in the world's international court on criminality.  The human rights advocacy group, Human Rights Watch, responded by expressing disbelief at Kony's claim but reiterating the fact that he was obligated to face trial at the ICC.  Meanwhile, the Ugandan government dismissed Kony's claim as ""rediculous."" Ugandan government spokesman Robert Kabushenga  said, ""A lot of information, a lot of evidence has been given by people abducted into the LRA. Young children, people who were their commanders have all admitted publicly [to atrocities], and of course there are reports by journalists who have gone to areas where the LRA has been in and massacred.""         In early July 2006, peace talks were scheduled to commence in Sudan between the Ugandan government and the Ugandan rebel movement, the Lord's Resistance Army in Sudan. Before the start of the talks in Sudan, however, President Museveni promised that LRA leader, Joseph Kony, might be granted amnesty.  Museveni's office noted in a statement that Kony would be granted amnesty if he responded positively at the peace talks and renounced terrorism.         

The promise of amnesty by the Ugandan leader came (1) in the face of the aforementioned indictments of war crimes; and (2) despite  a warning by  the ICC that Uganda had to fulfill its obligations to arrest the five indicted individuals from the LRA.  The move was expected to draw the ire of human rights groups as well as victims' rights enclaves.

Overall, the situation laid bare the uncomfortable tension between the quest for peace and the quest for justice following two decades of brutality.         On July 12, 2006, as the aforementioned talks were scheduled to commence in Sudan between the government and rebels, it was revealed that the top leadership of the LRA would not be in attendance.  The Ugandan government wanted to negotiate peace directly with a senior delegation, and as noted above, it even promised amnesty as a possibility for leaders wanted under international law.  However, had any of the individuals who were accused of crimes appeared at the talks, they would have been subject to arrest.  It was not known whether or not their absence at the peace talks in Sudan was driven by the threat of arrest, or if it would affect the prospects for peace.  That said, there was some speculation about the government's attendance at the talks as a result.  Nevertheless, peace talks ensued in Sudan, albeit without the presence of high ranking officials from the LRA.         With the peace talks underway, LRA rebel leader Joseph Kony held a formal meeting with Southern Sudanese vice-president and head peace mediator, Riek Machar, as well as a Ugandan official.  The talks on August 1, 2006 were held in a clearing of a forest on the border between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Sudan, rather than at the official talks within Sudan since the rebels did not want to risk detainment. At that meeting, Kony called for a ceasefire with the government.  Kony said, ""We wish to categorically state that no meaningful negotiations can take place without a cessation of hostilities."" Also, during interviews with journalists, he was asked if he thought he would ever stand trial in The Hague for charges of war crimes.  He reiterated his earlier denial of carrying out war crimes saying, ""No, no, no... because I did not do anything.""         On August 4, 2006,  the LRA announced an immediate unilateral ceasefire.  LRA Deputy Chief Vincent Otti said in a telephone  interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation that all field commanders had been instructed to cease attacks against the Ugandan  army.  In response, Ugandan Interior Minister Ruhakana Rugunda said that his government wanted to see if the ceasefire announcement would actually go into effect on the ground.          

Meanwhile, the peace talks which had taken a short hiatus were scheduled  to resume in the Sudanese town of Juba in the second week of August 2006.But a  week after the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) declared a unilateral ceasefire, the Ugandan army  announced on August 13, 2006 that it had killed a senior member of that rebel enclave.  A military spokesman said that Raska Lukwiya, who was wanted for war crimes, was shot dead in Kitgum after his group launched an ambush.  A soldier and a civilian were also killed in the altercation.  Lukwiya was described as the LRA's third highest ranking leader. It was not known how his death would affect peace talks, which ended without agreement and resulted in the absence of LRA representatives at talks following their truce announcement.With questions abounding a regarding the prospects for a solution,  President Yoweri Museveni set a deadline of September 12, 2006 by which a final peace deal had to be forged.  A day before that deadline,  LRA rebels converged on Juba in Sudan to reconvene for peace talks.A month later, the truce between the Ugandan army and the rebel Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) was underway, although it was quickly compromised.  In mid-October 2006, both sides violated the terms of their ceasefire, which was aimed at ending two decades of conflict.  LRA rebels violated the agreement by failing to assemble at both of the two points specified in southern Sudan -- a requisite element for amnesty.  On the other side of the equation, Ugandan forces approached a rebel stronghold in violation of the ceasefire deal.  LRA rebels said that fear of attack prevented them from assembling at the two sites, while the government said that the army had approached the rebel safe haven to check on the status of the LRA.  Both sides accepted responsibility for their respective violations, which highlighted the climate of mistrust between them.In mid-2007, the LRA said that it did not have the funding to pay for foreign travel.  As such, its ability to contact commanders located in remote areas would be difficult, and thusly, delay the peace negotiations.  Nevertheless, by August 2007,  in Juba in the Sudan, the LRA and the government were on track to forge a permanent ceasefire.For its part, the LRA has operated across borders in an area that traverses at least four countries. In 2008, LRA leader, Joseph Kony, refused to sign a peace deal until the International Criminal Court (ICC) withdrew its arrest warrants.  This action was followed by a joint-offensive by the governments of Uganda, DRC and Sudan in an effort to stamp out the rebels.  While the peace deal was eventually signed, since late 2008, LRA rebels have nonetheless continued to attack villages.By the start of 2009, the wide expanse of area from Central African Republic, through Sudan and into the DRC, has been part of the LRA terrain, although it is primarily based in DRC.  In an effort to repel the LRA, the government of the Central African Republic said that it would deploy its own troops to the border with the DRC.The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said at the start of 2009 that Ugandan rebels, known as the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), were carrying out vicious attacks on civilians in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and southern Sudan.

According to local accounts to the UNHRC, rebel attacks on  villages in Duru in the DRC resulted in the killing of a four-year old girl, the abduction of a nine-year old boy, and the mauling of two men. As well, the LRA rebels looted homes before burning them to the ground.  Survivors were forced to flee to the forested areas around the village. In the forest, people were being forced to live without food, water, medicine or sanitation since movement could lead to further attacks by the LRA.

According to an Anglican bishop in the southern Sudanese town of Mundri, an attack by LRA rebels resulted in the abduction of two boys.  When two of his parishioners attempted to rescue them, they were caught and faced brutal retribution by the rebels.  Indeed, the two boys who were subsequently rescued reported that while they were still alive, the hands and legs of the two parishioners were hacked off; they were then beaten to death.

Editor's Note:

During the 20-year long conflict between the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) and the Ugandan government, tens of thousands of people have died and two million have been displaced.  The LRA gained notoriety during this period for its gross violations of human rights, such as rape, torture, mutilation, murder and abduction of children for the purpose of making them either child soldiers or sex slaves.  United Nations Humanitarian Affairs head, Jan Egeland, has described the LRA's activities as being akin to the worst form of terrorism in the world.  He has also characterized the situation in Central Africa as a horrific humanitarian crisis.       Recent Developments       In September 2009, more than 600 people were arrested, at least 80 people were injured, and around 15 people were killed, as violent clashes raged in Uganda's capital of Kampala between government forces and loyalists of a traditional kingdom.  At issue was the decision by President Yoweri Museveni to ban King Ronald Mutebi II, the ruler of the Baganda tribe, from traveling to an area dominated by a rival group. The issue appeared to ignite simmering tensions between the government and the Buganda kingdom over land, power and sovereignty. While traditional kings have ceremonial roles related to traditions and cultural affairs, they do not have political authority.  Loyalists to the king reacted to the travel ban by protesting in the streets.  The situation quickly escalated into full-scale riots in which cars and tires were burned, buildings were set ablaze and stores were looted.  The riots were  ongoing for several days as police and the military sought to quell the violence. With a crackdown underway, Ugandan authorities moved on to launching investigations into the unrest and promised that the number of people arrested for inciting violence could well increase.       

In November 2009, leaders from  Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi were set to meet in Nairobi to sign a common market treaty. The East African Community was proposed a decade ago with efforts moving forward towards its adoption.  Once the agreement was signed, it was expected that the East African Community  would come into being by mid-2010.In the first part of 2010, the United States-based human rights and anti-genocide group, Enough Project, said in a report that Ugandan rebels notorious for their brutality had found safe haven in Sudan.  Enough Project said that the notorious Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), known for their horrific mutilations of victims and child abductions, was now operating in Sudan's western Darfur region.  The report, which was released in an advance copy to the news agency, Reuters,  noted that the LRA ""has taken refuge in areas of south Darfur, Sudan, controlled by the government of Sudan.""  For its part, the government of Sudan dismissed these claims as false.On July 11, 2010, scores of people died in double explosions in the Ugandan capital of Kampala. Local Ugandans as well as foreigners were among the victims. Ugandan police said the bombs exploded at a rugby club and at a restaurant as football fans watched the final match of the World Cup. In an interview with Agence France Press, Inspector General of Police Kal Kayihura said, ""These bombs were definitely targeting World Cup crowds.""

While there was no conclusive information about those behind the attacks, Police Chief Kaihura expressed the view that Somalia's extremist Islamic militia — al-Shabab, which has been linked with al-Qaida -- may have been to blame. Indeed, the feared Somali militants certainly made threats against Kampala, perhaps because of the fact that Ugandan troops were deployed in Mogadishu. Only days earlier, al-Shabab commander, Sheik Muktar Robow, demanded that militants attack venues in Uganda and Burundi since both countries have contributed troops to the African Union force in Mogadishu. Meanwhile, another al-Shabab commander, Sheik Yusuf Sheik Issa, refused to confirm or deny his group's role in the Kampala twin bombings but expressed happiness that they occurred at all. During an interview with the Associated Press, he said, ""Uganda is one of our enemies. Whatever makes them cry, makes us happy. May Allah's anger be upon those who are against us.""

With all available indications suggesting that Somali-based al-Shabab was responsible for the attacks, the group itself removed doubt by claiming responsibility for what appeared to be its first terror attack outside Somalia's borders. For its part, the Obama administration in the United States pledged help to track down those responsible. At the same time, the United States Department of States made it clear that it was focused on al-Shabab as a threatening entity with global jihadist aspirations. As well, it pointed to Executive Order 13536, signed by United States President Barack Obama, which was intended to block the finances of militant extremist Islamists in Somalia deemed to be a threat to the peace process in that country.      

Primer on 2011 presidential and parliamentary elections in Uganda

Voters went to the polls in Uganda on Feb. 18, 2011 to vote in presidential and parliamentary elections in that country. At the presidential levels, incumbent President Yoweri Museveni was hoping to hold onto power. President Museveni took power in 1986 but was elected since that time in repeated elections, illustrating his popular support.  The most recent elections were held in 2006.  His main rival was  Kizza Besigye, who said that if the election went off in a free and fair manner, he expected to win the presidency.  There were six other candidates contesting the nation's highest office.

Also at stake were the 332 seats in the unicameral National Assembly.  Of those 332 seats, 215 members are elected by popular vote, 104 nominated by legally established special interest groups,  and there are 13 ex officio members; all members serve five-year terms.  The last parliamentary elections were held in 2006 with the ruling National Resistance Movement or NRM (of the president) dominating the legislative body.  The main opposition party, the  Forum for Democratic Change or FDC, led by Besigye, was hoping to expand its presence in the legislative body.

The  European Union, which had election monitors on the ground in Uganda, asserted that while there may have been isolated problems, election day itself went off in a  relatively peaceful manner.  Still, the vote was not without its problems. A journalist was shot in the eastern part of the country when soldiers opened fire on an opposition politician.  Across the country, scores of people were reported to have been injured in election-related violence. It should also be noted that there was some criticism of the ruling party for using state funds to bribe voters, raising questions about the complete integrity of the election process.

Two days after the elections were held, Museveni was declared to be the winner with 68 percent of the vote share, effectively  extending his 25 years at the helm of power in Uganda. His main  challenger, Besigye, secured  26 percent of the vote, according to the Ugandan electoral authorities.  In the parliamentary elections, the ruling  National Resistance Movement or NRM of the president claimed victory.  Museveni's victory was likely helped by the fact that the opposition ranks in Uganda have been so sharply divided.   

Besigye responded to the news of his defeat by accusing the Museveni administration of election fraud and refused to accept the result.  Besigye was already on the record threatening to organize demonstrations if the vote did not go off in a free and fair manner.  By Feb. 25, 2011, Besigye had issued a call for demonstrations saying, ""The time is now for the people of Uganda to rise and peacefully protest against the outcome of the 2011 elections.""  For his part, President Museveni made it clear that he would not countenance such protests.

Meanwhile, President Museveni's victory was emblematic of the political landscape in the country.  The northern part of the country -- not a typical stronghold for the president with people living in squalid and poverty-stricken conditions -- swung their vote in his direction in 2011.  This shift was attributed to President Museveni's attempt to crackdown on the brutal  Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) in the region. The LRA was responsible for some of Africa's most heinous and most violent crimes against the residents of the region, displacing people already beset by the ravages of poverty. Museveni was likely rewarded at the polls for his efforts to address the inhumane attacks by the LRA in that region of Uganda.  Museveni also gained support from across the entirety of the country for the introduction of a free and universal educational program, which has more than doubled the enrolment of students in school.  Museveni additionally  had a strong record of economic accomplishment from which to draw support.  Under his leadership, Uganda's economy has seen expansion -- even gaining him accolades from the international spheres.  That being said, Museveni still was faced with challenges as he entered a new terms in office. Of key importance has been accusations of that some of his key officials were guilty of corruption -- a claim that led to the suspension of funds from the  Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. As well, the World Bank has warned that Uganda has been  suffering from a widening gap between the rich and the poor, despite the overall performance of the economy.   Recent Developments   In the April 2011, Ugandan security forces arrested opposition leader, Kizza Besigye, following repeated rounds of protests in which demonstrators took to the streets to register discontent over the high price of commodities and the increasing rate of inflation.  As well, students railed against a proposal to double tuition fees.

By the third week of April 2011, Bisigye had been arrested several times for his involvement in the protests, and was being charged with inciting unrest. Security forces also fired tear gas at the protesters, with an eye on breaking up the demonstrations.  Protesters responded by hurling stones at the police.  According to reports on the ground in Uganda, whereas Besigye had, until this point, been released following detainment, in this case, he was being taken to a courthouse in Nabweru. He was subsequently released from custody.

At the close of the month, Besigye was dragged from his car at gunpoint by police, sprayed with pepper gas,  and arrested once again, as protests raged on in Uganda.  Again, Besigye was taken to court; however, due to his injuries, he was unable to offer a plea.  The judge found the opposition leader to be suffering from ill health and the case against him was adjourned until May 2, 2011.

For his part, Besigye emphasized that he was not interested in stirring the public's anger for the purpose of overthrowing the government.  Instead, he said that people had the right to express their frustrations over rising prices and economic hardship.  The situation spurred a rare comment from the United States diplomatic corps as Assistant Secretary of State Johnnie Carson urged the Ugandan authorities to act in a""responsible and civil"" manner toward protesters.

Earlier, in February 2011, Besigye lost the presidential election to incumbent leader, President Yoweri Museveni, who enjoyed a decisive victory.  At the time,  Besigye accused the Museveni administration of election fraud and refused to accept the result. He also threatened to organize demonstrations against the government to protest the election result.  In April 2011, it was clear that Besigye could draw upon the economic cause to rally people in the streets.  That being said, President Museveni made it clear that he would not countenance unrest in Uganda.  The repeated arrests of Besigye illustrated this stance, and were underscored by the decision of the government to block the social media networks, Twitter and Facebook.

By May 2011, President Museveni was sworn into office for another term in the capital city of Kampala.  On the outskirts of the city, opposition protesters took to the streets to register their discontent and were confronted by security forces who fired tear gas at them.  There were also reports that at least one Bisigye supporter was shot to death.  Security forces said that the protesters were hurling stones at the convoy transporting officials to the inauguration and, therefore, they were justified in their actions.  Then by the middle of the month, Besigye was reported to have been placed under house arrest on the basis of being a threat to national security.  According to Ugandan authorities, Besigye was inciting unrest and police had evidence that he was plotting to commit a crime -- essentially, trying to create an Egyptian-style uprising.

Note: These developments collectively contributed to questions about President Museveni's commitment to democracy in Uganda.In mid-2011, a  food and drought crisis was  affecting the countries of the Horn of Africa including Somalia, Kenya, Ethiopia, Djibouti and Uganda.In October  2011, the Ugandan  parliament voted to suspend new oil sector deals amidst claims that several current or former cabinet ministers received bribes worth millions of dollars. The vote translated into the fact that the government's ability to sign on to new oil deals would now be blocked until petroleum legislation was passed into law.The charges of corruption included an accusation by Member of Parliament Gerald Karuhanga that the British-based company, Tullow Oil, paid bribes to Ugandan government ministers, which were intended to influence favorable decisions.  As reported by BBC News, Karuhanga submitted documents to parliament that he said showed Tullow Oil had given bribes to  Prime Minister Amama Mbabazi, Foreign Minister Sam Kutesa, and former Energy Minister Hilary Onek.  Kutesa and Onek both responded by saying that Karuhanga's claims were false.  For its part, Tullow rejected these claims, characterizing them as ""outrageous and wholly defamatory"" allegations, and said it intended to refute the accusations.  In parliament, Prime Minister Mbabazi read a letter from Tullow, which suggested that the whole controversy was based on  ""misunderstandings about how the global oil and gas industry works."" Regardless of the veracity of any of the competing claims, the scenario could not be viewed as anything but a political blow to Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni.

Uganda set to pass anti-gay law as ""Christmas gift"" to advocates In mid-November 2012, the speaker of the parliament of Uganda declared  the country would pass new legislation against  homosexuality by the end of 2012.The so-called ""anti-gay law"" broadly prohibits the ""promotion"" of gay rights and ensures the punishment of persons funding, sanctioning, or abetting homosexuality.  It would  ensure harsh jail terms, including  life sentences in certain circumstances, against those convicted of the aforementioned ""promotional"" acts associated with homosexuality, which was already illegal in Uganda. According to a report by the Associated Press, Speaker Rebecca Kadaga observed that Ugandans were ""demanding"" the law be passed and so it would be advanced by year's end as a  ""Christmas gift"" to its sponsors in this socially  and culturally conservative country.  Kadaga reportedly said: ""Ugandans want that law as a Christmas gift. They have asked for it and we'll give them that gift."" While this move might please conservative constituents in Uganda, it was being met with horror by human rights advocates and western leaders.  United States President Barack Obama characterized the legislation as ""odious.""  As well, Canadian Foreign Minister John Baird warned Uganda not to undermine human rights.  Meanwhile, foreign donors were threatening to cut aid to Uganda if the legislation went forward.  Opposition leader arrested On June 20, 2013, the Ugandan capital city of Kampala was hit by an episode of unrest as a result of an unsanctioned opposition rally. Reports suggested that Ugandan authorities arrested Kizza Besigye -- the country's main opposition leader -- for convening a  rally at the Kiseka market. They also accused him of ""seeking to incite violence.""  Besigye's detainment was not well-received by the crowds, with his supporters to hurling rocks and stones at the police to register their anger.  For their part, the police fired tear gas to disperse the crowd.  There were some reports that the police also used live rounds of ammunition leading to unconfirmed reports of one fatality. Notorious LRA leader Joseph Kony reported to be in ""surrender talks"" in CAR In the last part of November 2013,  Joseph Kony -- the notorious  warlord and leader of the violent and bloodthirsty Lord's Resistance Army -- was reported to be in talks with the government of the  Central African Republic (CAR)  aimed at securing his surrender.  A spokesperson for the government of the CAR said in an interview with BBC News that Kony was in that country but would not surrender until or unless  his security was guaranteed.  Assuming that condition was met, Kony would have to face justice at the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes.  As discussed below, Kony and the LRA have been on the radar of international powers and grassroots movements due to their horrific record of violence and abuse, including the massacre of villages, rape, abduction, and the conscription of child solders and sex slaves. 

It should be noted that in 2011, United States President Barack Obama  authorized the deployment  of approximately 100 combat-equipped  forces to Uganda  to assist regional forces in dealing with the LRA.  The precise mission was the ""removal from the battlefield"" – meaning capture or killing of --  LRA leader, Joseph Kony, and other senior leadership.  The forces would be working in a cross-border zone encompassing Uganda, South Sudan, Central African Republic (CAR), and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and would be operating with the consent of the participating African countries. In a letter dispatched to House Speaker John Boehner, Republican of Ohio, President Obama explained that ""although the U.S. forces are combat-equipped, they will only be providing information, advice, and assistance to partner nation forces, and they will not themselves engage LRA forces unless necessary for self-defense.""  Of course, the action was consistent with prevailing legal norms in the United States, due to legislation passed unanimously by Congress more than a year earlier in May 2010, called the ""Lord's Resistance Army Disarmament and Northern Uganda Recovery Act,"" which expressed congressional support ""for increased, comprehensive United States efforts to help mitigate and eliminate the threat posed by the LRA to civilians and regional stability.""  President Obama also noted that this deployment in 2011 would advance ""United States national security interests and foreign policy, and will be a significant contribution toward counter-LRA efforts in central Africa."" In March 2012, Joseph Kony -- the leader of the notorious and brutal entity, the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) -- became the target of a viral  video.  The 30-minute piece titled ""Kony 2012""  was posted onYouTube and was the work of the advocacy group, Invisible Children. It  has gained steam as it was posted and posted by individuals across the world via social media networks such as  Facebook.  The video aimed to draw attention to the gross atrocities committed by LRA leader Kony.  Among his alleged crimes have been massacres of villages, rape, abductions,  and the conscription of child solders.  To date, Kony remains at large despite the issuance of an indictment by the International Criminal Court on more than 30 counts of violations of international law, including war crimes, in 2005. The significance of the ""Kony 2012"" case aside, the group Invisible Children has been accused of drawing attention to the matter without accomplishing anything of actual value.  That is to say, there was no evidence that the viral effect of ""Kony 2012"" would actually contribute to the apprehension of Kony, or his cohorts, far less for helping solve the atrocious and pervasive problem of child soldiers in war zones across the globe.  Invisible Children's reputation was not helped by the fact that the director of the ""Kony 2012"" video, Jason Russell, was arrested on charges of licentious behavior in March 2012.  Russel's family said that he was suffering the effects of stress. As March 2012 entered its final week, the African Union (AU) said it would deploy 5,000 troops to search for Kony. Francisco Madeira, the African Union's special envoy on the LRA, said that Uganda, the Central African Republic, South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo -- all countries where the LRA has been active -- would contribute troops to the effort to apprehend Kony. The new troops would work with the 100 United States military advisers that United States President Barack Obama ordered to Uganda to assist that country in dealing with the LRA threat.  The AU further said  that the operation would continue until Kony was captured or killed.  At the close of April 2012, joint African and American troops were asserting their success in their search for Kony, who was believed to be  moving between Sudan and the Central African Republic.  According to Colonel Felix Kulayigye, a Ugandan military spokesman who was interviewed by CNN, part of the difficulty in locating Kony has been the fact that he can move freely across national borders in the region of Central Africa.  Kulayigye said: ""This is the strategy that he has used for the last four to five years. When the pressure is too much here, he runs across the border because he knows we are not allowed to go after him. Whenever pressure is high, he just switches to north Sudan. It hampers our operation.""  Nevertheless, progress was being made in the efforts of joint African and American troops  to capture Kony and his cadre. Abou Moussa, the United Nations' special representative for Central Africa, explained: ""Contrary to what Kony used to do -- that he would stay one month, two months on the ground -- he is now moving almost every other day which means the pressure is mounting on him.""  By mid-May 2012, the Ugandan army had captured a senior  commander and military strategist of the LRA.  Caesar Achellam was reportedly apprehended following a struggle between Ugandan soldiers and a group of LRA rebels  in the Central African Republic. The Ugandan army touted the capture of Achellam as a major development in the fight to defeat the LRA.  To date, Kony remains at large despite the 2005 issuance of an indictment by the International Criminal Court on more than 30 counts of violations of international law, including war crimes and  crimes against humanity.  Kony and his followers have been accused of maiming and killing civilians, as well as kidnapping children and forcing them to be either soldiers or sex slaves.As discussed above, as of November 2013, Kony was engaged in surrender talks with the government of the CAR. The rationale for Kony's interest in surrender was unknown.  However, it was possible that the pressure upon the LRA since 2011 due to  the campaign to arrest the group's leadership, in conjunction with reports of Kony's ill health, may have contributed to his decision to consider the path of surrender.Editor's Note:The Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) is one of the most brutal entities operating in the world today. During the 20-year long conflict between the LRA and the Ugandan government, tens of thousands of people have died and two million have been displaced.  Despite periodic peace overtures by the government, and in defiance of their own ceasefire declarations, the LRA has gone on to repeatedly carry out violent attacks on civilian populations in Uganda and surrounding border zones.  Indeed, the LRA has operated across borders in an area that traverses several countries, compelling a joint-offensive by regional powers in an effort to stamp out the rebels. Nevertheless, by 2010, the United States-based human rights and anti-genocide group, Enough Project, said the LRA had found safe haven in Sudan and was operating in Sudan's western Darfur region.The LRA gained notoriety for its gross violations of human rights, such as rape, torture, murder, abduction of children for the purpose of making them either child soldiers or sex slaves, and vicious mutilation.  United Nations Humanitarian Affairs head Jan Egeland has described the LRA's activities as being akin to the worst form of terrorism in the world.  He has also characterized the situation in Central Africa as a horrific humanitarian crisis.In 2004, the International Criminal Court of the United Nations commenced a war crimes investigation into the atrocities committed by  the LRA. A year later in 2005, the ICC completed the inquest and issued the indictments of the group's five senior leaders.  The war crimes charges included murder, rape, and forcible enlistment of children.  The five individuals indicted included Kony, the leader of the LRA, as well as Raska Lukwiya, Vincent Otti, Okot Odhiambo and Dominic Ongwen. All five were yet to be apprehended. According to the ICC, it would be Uganda's responsibility to ensure that all five individuals were brought into custody to face trial.In 2006, with no progress on the capture of the LRA leadership by Ugandan authorities, the international police agency, INTERPOL, issued wanted notices for the five indicted individuals (including Kony) on behalf of the ICC.In mid-October 2011, United States President Barack Obama  authorized the deployment  of approximately 100 combat-equipped  forces to Uganda  to assist regional forces in dealing with the notorious Lord's Resistance Army.  The precise mission was the ""removal from the battlefield"" – meaning capture or killing of --  LRA leader Joseph Kony and other senior leadership.  The forces would be working in a cross-border zone encompassing Uganda, South Sudan, Central African Republic (CAR), and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and would be operating with the consent of the participating African countries. In March 2012, the African Union announced the deployment of 5,000 troops in this effort.  More than a month later, these joint forces expressed the view that they were making progress in mission to deal with the LRA threat and apprehend the group's leadership.  As discussed above, as of November 2013, Kony was engaged in surrender talks with the government of the CAR.Special Report:  Ugandan troops in South SudanIn -January 2014, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni confirmed that his country's troops were involved in the fight against South Sudan rebels.

South Sudan -- the world's newest independent nation state -- was gripped by a complex ethno-political crisis  in late 2013 and well into the start of 2014 as a result of a power struggle between President Salva Kiir, an ethnic Dinka,  and his former deputy, Riek Machar, an ethnic Nuer, who was now leading a rebel movement. This internal  conflict between Dinkas and Nuers was yielding tragic results in the form of mass upheaval and ethnic killing.  In addition to being on the precipice of a civil war, South Sudan was also dealing with a humanitarian crisis.  Thus the involvement of Ugandan troops in South Sudan to aid the effort of government troops.

President Yoweri Museveni also added that Ugandan forces had been involved in the defeat of the  rebels during a ""big battle""  to the north of the capital city of Juba.  The Ugandan leader acknowledged that some of his country's forces had suffered casualties in the battle.  As January 2014 entered its third week,  government troops were advancing on the city of Bor, the capital of Jonglei state, with an eye on regaining control there. To that end,  South Sudan's military soon announced that it had recaptured the strategic town  from rebel forces.  Ugandan forces were reportedly involved in the operation.  Attention was soon shifting to  the town of Malakal, which was still partially under rebel control.  

Note on ElectionsPresidential and parliamentary elections were scheduled to be held in Uganda on Feb. 18, 2016.The previous elections were held in 2011; it was to be seen if the voters of Uganda in 2016 would opt for a transition of power.In the previous presidential contest of 2011, the incumbent President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, of the ruling National Resistance Movement or NRM, was re-elected to power, handily beating his main rival and opposition figure, Kizza Besigye, by landslide victory.In 2016, it was to be seen if President Museveni's political domination would prevail at the polls where he would be faced with seven opponents. The general consensus was that the 2016 contest would be a far more competitive endeavor than the election of 2011.  The other presidential candidates included -- but were not limited to  -- the aforementioned opposition figure Besigye, who was released from house arrest and who would be the candidate of the main opposition Forum for Democratic Change or FDC,  as well as former Prime MinisterJohn Patrick Amama Mbabazi, who would be representing the GoForward bloc.At stake in the parliamentary elections would be the composition of the unicameral National Assembly with its 338 seats. In that legislative body,  238 members are directly elected in single-seat constituencies by simple majority vote; there are 112 seats earmarked for women who are directly elected in single-seat constituencies by simple majority vote, and there are 25 ""representatives"" reserved for special interest groups from the army (10 seats), the disabled (five seats), youth (five seats), labor 5; there are 13 ex-officio members who are appointed by the president.In 2011, the  ruling National Resistance Movement or NRM  of the president won the vast majority of the seats, with a minority of seats going to opposition parties including the main opposition Forum for Democratic Change or FDC, led by Besigye.  In 2016, it was to be seen if the elections would produce a similar result as before or if voters would opt for change.In the days leading up to the elections, Uganda was beset by political violence, largely spurred by rock-throwing opposition supporters. The  police entered the fray and used both bullets and tear gas to disperse the crowds.  Several people were reported to have been wounded during these clashes.It should be noted that ahead of the voting, Besigye -- the opposition leader -- was placed under house arrest as part of the Ugandan authorities' attempt to stop the violence.Finally, on Feb. 18, 2016, voters went to polling stations to cast their ballots in Uganda's presidential and parliamentary elections.  Once the vote tally was complete, the country's Electoral Commission declared that incumbent President Yoweri Museveni secured his re-election with more than 60 percent of the vote share against the opposition leader, Kizza Besigye, who garnered 35 percent.While the president's supporters celebrated his victory, the opposition Forum for Democratic Change (FDC) rejected  the final results.  Indeed, the opposition leader, Besigye,  alleged fraud in a statement that read as follows:  ""We have just witnessed what must be the most fraudulent electoral process in Uganda.""  He also demanded an independent audit of the results.In the days after the elections, Ugandan authorities seemed determined to crackdown on those deemed to be a political threat of sorts.  Of note was the fact that police raided the headquarters of the opposition Forum for Democratic Change (FDC) and arrested several people there.Faced with criticism for this move, a spokesperson for the police said the arrests were intended to stave off acts of violence in the capital of Kampala.Meanwhile, the international community decried the climate of repression that has come to characterize the Ugandan political landscape, with election observers from the European Union and the Commonwealth noting that the election ensued an  atmosphere of intimidation that fell short of democratic standards.As noted by Eduard Kukan, the chief observer for the European Union mission, ""The EC (electoral commission) lacks independence, transparency and the trust of stakeholders.""  Kikan added that the dominance of President  Museveni's ruling National Resistance Movement (NRM) party ""distorted the fairness of the campaign and state actors created an intimidating atmosphere for both voters and candidates.""

Opposition leader in Uganda charged with treason   In mid-May 2016, the main  opposition leader in Uganda,  Kizza Besigye,  was charged with treason for challenging the election victory of long-serving leader, President Yoweri Museveni, in February 2016.   Of note was the fact that Besigye self-declared himself to be the country's ;leader despite actually losing the election to Museveni.    Following his arrest, Besigye was  charged with treason at a court in Moroto and then remanded to jail.         A spokesperson for the government, Shaban Bantariza, explained the move, saying Besigye had been charged with treason due to the fact that he had himself ""an alternative president."" Bantariza said, ""He has openly declared his intention to topple this government, that's not constitutional.""  The charge of treason would carry with it  the death penalty ad could trigger unprecedented tensions in Uganda in recent times, should such an end seem likely.   -- January 2017

",419345,"Bangladesh, Aug. 9 -- Women domestic helps who returned home were denied justice in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), workers and rights activists said.

Though a significant number of women workers came back home from the oil-rich country due to exploitation, not a single case was filed against their employers, they said.

According to them, since January of the current calendar year at least 1,500 maids have returned home only from Bangladesh embassy's safe home in Riyadh and Saudi immigration camps.

Most of these women faced tortures like sexual, psychological and physical abuses. Lack of proper food and wages also forced them to return home.

The workers and rights campaigners said if punishment is not ensured, Saudi employers will continue torturing housemaids.

Bangladesh embassy should make an all-out effort to bring the offenders to book, they observed.

Human rights lawyer Salma Ali said Bangladesh embassy should not deny access to justice for victim women.

""If necessary, the government should train up labour officials to help the women run legal procedures properly,"" she said.

Until or unless justice is ensured, Bangladeshi women workers will not feel safe at their workplaces in Saudi Arabia,Ms Ali noted.

Talking to the FE, several women alleged that Bangladesh embassy did not take any initiative to bring the employers to justice.

Officials at the safe homes listened to their stories, but they did not file any case with the labour court there.

They still want to tell their stories before the court. They also want to show their bodies wounded by their masters and get back wage dues.

Rubina Begum (penname), who hails from Gaibandha district, said at least 455 women took shelter at the same safe home where she resided in. But no woman got legal assistance.

Many of them became traumatised because of maltreatment. Broken legs and burnt bodies were also common problems being faced by migrant women, she mentioned.

""Officials interviewed us, but they did not take any action against the employers,"" Rubina said.

Had the embassy helped them, she thinks, every woman might have lodged a complaint against their masters and recruiting agents concerned.

When asked, the woman said she was forced to work about 20 hours a day. ""My madam beat me when I requested for taking rest.""

After some days, the situation became unbearable when her madam's husband returned from the USA.

""The man offered me to have a sexual relationship. I rejected her offer. But he insisted regularly,"" she mentioned.

""After that I fled from the house,"" she added.

Saleha Begum (penname), another Saudi returnee woman, also echoed the same, saying that no worker residing in safe home was provided with legal assistance and compensation.

Instead of legal support, police arrested the women on theft charges, she said. Even the embassy did not want to hear their problems, she added.

""Staffers of the safe home only ask about dues of wages. At the same time, they also suggested that the women should not claim wages as it will take long time in repatriating them home,"" she added.

""Of course, I want justice as I am still bearing wounds in different parts of my body. I am also suffering from backache,"" the woman said in reply to a query.

Shariful Islam, head of BRAC Migration Programme, said so far there is no example of bringing any employer to justice for abuse of Bangladeshi women workers.

If punishment was ensured, exploitation would not increase in such a way, he said.

A large number of women returned home in last six months. Still the influx of women continues. So, Bangladesh should take necessary action to bring the offenders to book.

""If necessary, they can collect DNA in case of rape victims,"" he added.

Preferring anonymity, a representative of BRAC Migration Programme, said at least 21 women became traumatised severely and underwent treatment at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH).

Some of them became pregnant and they are now abandoned by their families, said the BRAC official who received some of these women.

The future of women who returned home is now uncertain. The families and societies are considering them as a burden. If these women get compensation, they can survive, he added.

The officials at the Ministry of Expatriates' Welfare and Overseas Employment said women don't want to go for legal action against their employers as they want to come back home quickly.

The officials also said a few number of women were subjected to abuse which is very 'natural'.

When contacted, Aminul Islam, additional secretary of the ministry, said Bangladesh embassy has sufficient logistics and legal experts to address legal issues.

But women don't want to file any case against their employers as they want to come back home quickly, he said.

""When a woman will lodge a case, she will not get a job. So, how will the woman stay in that country?"" he posed a question.

Shakirul Islam, chairman of Ovibashi Karmi Unnayan Programme (OKUP), said if women don't want to be plaintiffs, the embassy itself should lodge cases.

Through power of attorney, the embassy can also continue the cases if women return home, he explained.

""So, there is no obstacle to run the cases if women are not present in that job destination country,"" Mr Islam said.

Bangladesh and Saudi Arabia inked a deal on recruitment of domestic helps in 2015. Since then, over 0.2 million women went to the Gulf nation, according to official data.

Sector insiders said some 5,000 women returned home from Saudi Arabia in last three years alleging workplace exploitation.

About 0.7 million Bangladeshi women workers went abroad with jobs since 1991.

",442359,"PAKISTAN has unsettled borders with India and Afghanistan. Its relations with India are warlike and with Afghanistan full of mistrust. Islamabad and Tehran have normal relations. Presently, only China considers Pakistan a reliable neighbour and thereby both states have been developing China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. Pakistan's socio-economic prosperity needs peaceful neighbourhood not only economic cooperation with one neighbouring state and a mere normality with the other and conflicts with the remaining. Therefore, the new government's primary responsibility is to identify challenges and sincerely work for improving Islamabad's relations with the neighbouring states.

Imran Khan, the Prime Minister-in-waiting, promised to endeavour to improve the international community confidence in Pakistan and also make better bilateral relations with the neighbouring countries. He announced that the solution of conflicts with the neighbouring countries should be found through dialogue process. Indeed, a dialogue is the best mean to resolve the conflicts. Are the neighbours prepared for a result-oriented dialogue process? Theoretically, sustainable peace between Pakistan and its neighbours seems possible. Practically, improving trust with both the Indian and Afghan leadership is a Herculean task.

Political and military competition with India remains the centrepiece of Pakistan's foreign and strategic policy. India has been using hybrid warfare tactics to bleed Pakistan economically and jeopardize its internal security. The challenge for the new government will be to engage India in a dialogue process to resolve the bilateral disputes. New Delhi seems not prepared to restart a sustainable dialogue process to resolve the mutual conflicts peacefully and prevent the escalation of border skirmishes into total war. Indeed, total war between the nuclear weapon states will be catastrophic for the entire region.

The positive development is that on July 30, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi telephoned Khan and congratulated him on his party's victory in the general election and conveyed him that India is ready to enter in a new era of relations with Pakistan and 'to make progress on mutual matters both the countries should adopt a joint strategy.' It sounds a mere diplomatic nicety. What is meant by joint strategy? Premier Modi has been using the military machine to quash the right of self-determination movement of the Kashmiris in the Indian Occupied Kashmir. He demands that either government of Pakistan talk with Kashmiri leaders or with his government. According to him, the Kashmiri leaders are terrorists. Hence, his offer to adopt a joint strategy is a nonstarter.

Being a neighboring state, Pakistan has a legitimate interest in Afghanistan's political stability. The continuity of civil war and the presence of transnational terrorist sanctuaries, such as Daesh, TTP, etc. have a devastating spillover impact on Pakistan. Therefore, the new government ought to work for improving the situation in Afghanistan. President Ashraf Ghani showed interest in working with Khan. He tweeted on July 29, that both sides had also 'agreed to overcome the past and to lay a new foundation for a prosperous political, social and economic future of both countries Afghanistan and Pakistan.' The recent inauguration of the Afghanistan-Pakistan Action Plan for Peace and Solidarity (APAPPS) foster a hope for improving the trust between Kabul and Islamabad. The new government will ensure the execution of APAPPS.

Pakistan-Iran relations have been transformed from cordial to normal since the mid-1970s to date. This shift in relations was due to several reasons, such as, Iranians perception that their Revolution was Islamic as opposed to simply being Iranian; sectarian (shia-sunni) clashes in Pakistan; Islamabad's cordiality with Saudi Arab and United Arab Emirates; Indo-Iran geo-strategic convergence entailing to signing of defense pact in November 2003; Pakistan's strategic alliance with the United States; political competition in Afghanistan. Though these factors often strain bilateral relations, yet neither country faces a real security threat from the other, nor did they suspend diplomatic relations.

Since 2014, Islamabad has been maintaining a neutral position in the Middle Eastern and Persian/Arabian Gulf states' affairs. This approach has improved mutual trust between Iran and Pakistan. On August 4, 2018, Khan's meeting with the Iranian Ambassador Mehdi Honardoost was very promising. Khan told the Iranian Ambassador that his government will enhance cooperation in the regional development, and will also expand trade with Iran. The best option for the new government will be to start the construction on Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline project.

To conclude, though the work on the CPEC project has been progressing smoothly, yet without improving the internal and external security environment, attracting foreign investment in Pakistan is impossible. Hence, the peaceful neighbourhood is imperative for efficiently utilizing the geographical location of the country for the socio-economic prosperity of the people of Pakistan.",31,"The new government will ensure the execution of APAPPS.

"Will the Sri Lankan government carry out an execution before 8 September 2018?
",614043,"India, May 12 -- The abduction of seven Indians in Afghanistan has raised two questions. One relates to the incident itself and the second on what it signifies in terms of the drift of events in that country and its implications for India

The abduction of seven Indian engineers and their Afghan driver in Afghanistan's Baghlan Province on Sunday, May 6, raises two sets of questions. The first relates to the incident itself and the second, what it signifies in terms of the drift of events in that country and its implications for India. According to some reports, the Taliban carried out the abductions under the mistaken impression that the victims were employees of the Afghan Government. They, it was further reported, had said that those abducted would be returned soon.

They have not been returned till the time of writing and, according to reports, are being held in the Taliban-controlled village of Dand-i-Sahabuddin in the outskirts of the town Pul-i-Khumri in Baghlan. A clue to unravelling whether the abduction was actually a mistake perhaps lies in the fact that the engineers were travelling without armed escort because both local contractors and the Taliban had assured that they would not be harmed. This suggests that the Taliban knew that they would be travelling and, hence, could not have mistaken them for Government employees. In any case, it is not frightfully difficult to distinguish Indians from Afghans working for their Government.

On what basis did the local contractors, who also said that the Taliban would not attack the engineers, form their opinion? If it was trust in the Taliban's assurance, then it was, to put it mildly, an unbelievable act of naivete. Baghlan Province was on the verge of falling to the Taliban who had been launching furious assaults in several areas as part of their spring offensive, Al Khandak. Besides, they are known to be prepared to do anything to get Al Bakhtiyar, one of their foremost leaders in the Province whom the Government forces have taken prisoner, released. This also means that even if the abduction of seven Indians was a mistake, it is quite on the cards that they may now seek to exchange them in lieu of Al Bakhtiyar.

As could be expected, the role of Pakistan and its Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate (ISI) has come under scrutiny. Was it behind the incident if the latter was not an accident? If not, is it, post-abduction, trying to fish in troubled waters and, as has been reported, pressing the Taliban to delay the return of the engineers? The answer is likely to be in the positive, as such a gambit would fit smoothly into its design of reversing the spread of India's influence in Afghanistan.

Denying India space in Afghanistan would require a Government there which is a creature of Pakistan and not one that is independent of it and friendly toward New Delhi. It is well-known that Pakistan wants such a Government partly because of its pathological hatred for India, which is a major driving force behind its foreign and military policies, and partly a result of its desire for using Afghanistan to gain what it calls strategic depth against India. The abduction and prolonged detention of the seven Indians, one can reasonably argue, could well have been a part of implementing this wider design.

It would frighten off power companies like the KEC, an Indian outfit for which the abductees worked and which, along with other Indian companies active in the area, is playing a key role in Afghanistan's power front, where New Delhi's contribution is greatly appreciated by the people. In Pakistan's calculation, a continued proliferation of such attacks, may lead, to start with, India's exit from the power front, and, eventually, to a freezing of all of New Delhi's developmental activities in the country. This may halt the expansion of India's popularity and then put it in the reverse gear.

India can hardly be indifferent to Pakistan's skullduggery given its historic ties with Afghanistan, which have been deepened and reinforced by the close ties developed in recent years. It has already poured $2 billion dollar and it is committed to invest $1 billion more. It signed a strategic partnership agreement with Afghanistan in 2011; has been providing assistance to help rebuild Afghanistan's infrastructure and institutions and education and technical assistance to re-build indigenous Afghan capacity in different areas. It has been encouraging investment in Afghanistan's natural resources, providing duty free access to the Indian market for Afghanistan's exports, supporting an Afghan-led broad-based and inclusive process of peace and reconciliation, and advocating the need for a sustained and long-term commitment to Afghanistan by the international community.

All this would be in jeopardy if Afghanistan has a Government controlled by Islamabad. What can be done to prevent it from coming to power? One cannot expect the Afghans to do it. Despite occasional successes, the Government's Armed Forces have not been able withstand the Taliban's offensives at most places. Apart from being heavily outnumbered in some places, they have been severely handicapped by poor leadership and inadequate training, weapons and equipment. They have virtually no heavy weaponry and the apology of an air force. Unless the insufficiencies in each of these areas are addressed, one cannot rule out the possibility of the Afghan forces going under.

Critically important, therefore, will be the United States' role, particularly that of its military. There are 14,000 American troops in Afghanistan now and President Trump has indicated that he would give Pentagon the authority to add several thousand more troops, give the generals more autonomy to attack the Taliban in Afghanistan and the objective was winning and not nation-building. He has also been scathing in his criticism of Pakistan's duplicitous role of clandestinely supporting some terrorist groups while claiming to fight terrorism.

Unfortunately, things have not changed significantly on the ground and, given Trump's new pre-occupations with Iran and North Korea and the growing criticism of his conduct and policies at home, one wonders whether they will. On the other hand, both China and Russia are beginning to take a hand in Afghanistan in cooperation with Pakistan. The question is: Where does all this leave India?

India cannot bank on the United States given Trump's pre-occupations and the lack of consistency and resolution - swinging from an avowal of its determination to rout the Taliban to talking about withdrawal - that has characterised American policies in Afghanistan so far. As of now, the other option of teaming up with Russia and China does not seem likely to be realised soon if India follows the kind of route it has been following. It has to make Russia and China realise that it needed to be taken on board. For this, it must show its willingness to support the Kabul regime not only with investments and financial and technological aid but military support. It has so far provided it with four attack helicopters and training for its military personnel. It must now consider giving it heavy artillery and combat aircraft and tanks being phased out by the IAF but good enough for strafing the Taliban. It may not even have to actually do so. The very announcement that it would, may take Beijing and Moscow take serious note of its concerns.

",340966,"Iran's reaction to latest deadly strikes to determine the length and intensity of confrontation, say analysts.

 Israeli raids against alleged Iranian targets inside Syria have raised fears of a major confrontation in the Middle East.  Amid international calls for restraint and calm, Israeli officials said Thursday's attacks were not aimed at opening a new front in Syria's war, but analysts say much will depend on Iran's response.  The Israeli military has said that its warplanes targeted intelligence, logistics, storage and vehicles in response to rocket fire targeting its forces in the occupied Golan Heights, which it blames on Iran.  Avigdor Lieberman, Israel's defence minister, said the Israeli assault struck ""almost all of the Iranian infrastructure in Syria"", and added that Israel will desist from launching any further attacks. 

 ""I hope we finished this chapter and everyone got the message,"" he said, but warned that ""if it rains on us [Israel], it will pour on them [Iran].""  Iran has not commented on the rocket fire.  Situation unclear  The situation remains unclear, with an independent war monitor claiming  the rockets followed a ""first Israeli bombardment on the town of Baath"" in Quneitra province.  Also on Tuesday, Syrian state media reported attacks on a military base in Kisweh, south of Damascus, and accused Israel of carrying out the raid.  The strikes on Kisweh came shortly after President  Donald Trump  announced US withdrawal from the 2015  Iran nuclear deal , and resulted in the deaths of 15 people, eight of whom were Iranians, according to the war monitor.    Iranian forces based in Syria reportedly retaliated the next day, launching 20 rockets in the direction of the Israeli-occupied Syrian territory of Golan Heights.  The Israeli military accused Iran's Revolutionary Guard (IRGC) and its Quds Force, headed by General Qassem Suleimani, of being behind the attack.  Analysts said the Israeli retaliation was meant to signal Tel Aviv's resolve, without allowing the conflict spiral out of control.  ""I don't think Israel is interested in continuing a prolonged war with Iran because this might spill over to other theatres, including in Lebanon with Hezbollah, effectively making it a proxy war,"" Yossi Mekelberg, a professor of international relations at Regent's University, London, told Al Jazeera.  ""Israel runs the risk, by doing what it did, that Iran will feel almost obliged and forced to retaliate again.  ""That's the danger when things like this start, you don't know how and who's going to stop. You know how it starts, but you don't know how it will end.""  'We'd like to stop'  Mekelberg said the message that Israel was trying to get across is that it was not interested in escalation.  By saying ""we achieved our objectives, Israel is effectively saying 'we'd like to stop'"", he said.  However, ""the ball is now in the court of Iran.""  Ghanbar Naderi, an Iranian political analyst, said it was unlikely that Iran will pull back and relinquish all the gains it has made in Syria in recent years.    In Naderi's view, the attacks on Iranian outposts are a last-ditch attempt by Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, to save face as he struggles to accept the Syrian government and its Iranian backers' successive victories.  ""At the end of the day, this is a limited campaign in order to send the message that they have not lost the war.  ""I think they have lost the war and should call it quits and allow Syria to reconstruct itself from scratch,"" Naderi said.  Naderi, however, is unequivocal about Iran's willingness and ability to retaliate in the event of future Israeli aggression.  ""This is not the first time that Israel attacks Syria from the Golan Heights and certainly won't be the last one,"" he says.  ""We are expecting more attacks in the coming weeks and months. But the simple fact is that Iran is going to stay in Syria.  ""If Israel hits Syrian or Iranian forces, there will be retaliation. This is no longer the Syria of five or six years ago.""",31,"""If Israel hits Syrian or Iranian forces, there will be retaliation.",0.2337058335542679,4.3207972049713135,3
"Will Iran execute or be targeted in an acknowledged national military attack outside of Syria involving Israel or any G7 nation between 23 August and 7 September 2018?
",656717,"May 12, 2018( Voice of America: http://www.voanews.com Delivered by Newstex)  In the escalating confrontation between Israel and Iran, Israel's defense minister called on Syria's President Bashar al-Assad on Friday to rid his country of Iranian forces based there, warning their presence would only cause more trouble for the war-ravaged country.  Avigdor Lieberman's comments were followed by threats from an Iranian cleric that Tel Aviv or Haifa would be in danger if Israel did ""anything foolish.""  The war of words followed the worst faceoff to date between Israel and Iran. Israel fired dozens of missiles at what it said were Iranian positions in Syria on Thursday, hours after it said its forces in the occupied Golan Heights had been targeted by Iranian rockets. The brief but intense confrontation raised fears the region may be sliding into an unprecedented direct conflict between the two archenemies. 

Here is a look at why the two countries are at each's other throats and why Syria could be the ground for a showdown. Why Syria? Iran sent massive military help to its ally, Assad, to rescue his rule against armed rebellion during that country's seven-year-old civil war. With the war winding down in favor of Assad, Israel   which saw him as the lesser of two evils compared with Islamic hard-liners among rebels   is now finding that his victory has brought Iran closer to its borders. Israel has increasingly warned that it sees Iranian influence in Syria as a threat, pointing to Iran's military presence inside the country as well as that of Iranian-backed militiamen. Israeli officials have said that 80,000 Shiite fighters in Syria are under Iranian control, including forces of Lebanon's Hezbollah and Iraqi and Afghan fighters. Iranian officials and their allies have spoken of securing a corridor from Iran to Lebanon, through Syria and Iraq. Israel fears that will allow Iran to more easily transfer weapons to Hezbollah, Lebanon's powerful Shiite guerrilla force, and reinforce the militant group's influence over the region. During the civil war, Israel is believed to have carried out hundreds of strikes in Syria, mainly hitting weapons shipments. Tension has been building. An airstrike on a military base in Syria last month, which Iran and Russia blamed on Israel, killed seven Iranians. In February, Israel shot down an Iranian drone that entered its airspace, triggering a clash in which an Israeli warplane crashed after being struck by Syrian anti-aircraft fire. What does the nuclear deal have to do with rising tensions? Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a sharp critic of the Iran nuclear deal. Now, with President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from it, Netanyahu may be emboldened to pursue his confrontation with Iran. Tehran, meanwhile, is under pressure from the U.S. and Western allies to negotiate a new deal, one that goes beyond restricting the nuclear program to curb Iran's military power in the region. Iranian officials have rejected any new accord. Tehran has not completely walked away from the nuclear deal, since the Europeans are still participating. But if it collapses and the U.S. imposes heavy new sanctions on Iran, prospects for major fallout with Israel are higher. Have Israel and Iran always been mortal enemies? During the rule of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, Iran had close relations with Israel, starting in the 1950s, including diplomatic representations and direct flights. The two countries were the main allies of the United States in the region, and Iranian oil was shipped to Israel during the 1973 war. But the 1979 Islamic Revolution ousting the shah ended that. The revolution's leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, declared Israel an ""enemy of Islam"" and cut all ties. Hostile rhetoric has escalated over the decades since. Israel considers the government in Iran an existential threat. But unlike Israel and its Arab neighbors, the two countries have never had a direct confrontation. Instead, Israel has fought Iran's ally, Hezbollah, the last time in a 2006 war that saw massive destruction in southern Lebanon and concentrated rocket fire on Israeli cities. Is the Mideast sliding toward an all-encompassing war? The reported Iranian attack on Israeli positions in the Golan and Israel's bombardment of suspected Iranian posts in Syria appeared to be warnings by each side that it is willing to respond   but not necessarily that they want to plunge into war. But if they do escalate, the region could face one of its worst cross-border conflicts in decades, one that could potentially drag in the United States, a major ally of Israel, and Russia, which is Syria's mightiest ally. Although Iran may not be a match for Israel's military power, it has a variety of allies and ways to hit back if corned by the U.S., Israel and Saudi Arabia, Iran's regional rival. Iran has an ally in Hamas, the Palestinian militant group in Gaza. In Lebanon, Hezbollah would stand ready to support its patron Iran. In Iraq, Iran sponsors a range of Shiite militias and has close ties to the political leadership. In Yemen, the war in its fourth year is seen as a proxy between Saudi Arabia and Iran and can be a place for Tehran to retaliate and increase pressure. Saudi Arabia already accuses Iran of providing missiles that Yemeni rebels have fired toward Riyadh.",35,The reported Iranian attack on Israeli positions in the Golan and Israel's bombardment of suspected Iranian posts in Syria appeared to be warnings by each side that it is willing to respond   but not necessarily that they want to plunge into war.,0.2363595962524414,4.3207972049713135,3

He said: ""I do not anticipate asking for more dollars. Should Iran do something, that is a different issue. But no, I am not coming to you with an additional supplemental funding request.""

Anwar Gargash, UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, tweeted that Iran had been emboldened by the nuclear deal, and ""its ballistic missile program became both offensive and exportable"".

Trump has employed similar arguments, criticising the accord for failing to address Iran's ballistic missile program, its nuclear activities beyond 2025, or its role in regional wars.

Mohammed, another Saudi businessman, said: ""He is supporting us not because we are Saudi Arabia or because we have oil, but because he thinks we are right.""

Oman, which orchestrated secret US-Iran contacts that helped pave the way for the deal in 2015, was more measured.

Its foreign ministry said: ""We believe the United States and the Islamic Republic of Iran are interested in realising peace and stability in the region, and the choice of confrontation is not in the interest of either side.""

",454075,"Israel has launched its most intensive attack on Iranian positions in neighbouring Syria since the civil war began in 2011, bringing two of the region's major powers closer to the brink of direct confrontation than ever before.

The early morning bombardment killed 23 people, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said. It was issued in response to what the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said was the first ever Iranian rocket attack on its troops, in the Golan Heights.

The confrontation on yesterday marks the most significant military skirmish between the two enemies to date amid a backdrop of escalating regional tensions.

Theresa May and French president Emmanuel Macron have both called for ""calm on all sides"". Mr Macron is due to discuss the issue with German chancellor Angela Merkel later in the day.

The White House condemned what it said was Iran's ""provocative rocket attacks from Syria against Israeli citizens"", emphasising ""Israel's right to act in self-defence.""

Russia also called the strikes a ""alarming development"" and urged for a de-escalation. During the overnight incident civilians in both the Golan Heights, the Damascus countryside and Syria's south were kept awake by the sound of low-flying military jets and explosions.

Israel has been on heightened alert in recent days in anticipation of an Iranian attack: Tehran has vowed retaliation for two other recent Israeli strikes in Syria which targeted and killed at least 13 Iranian nationals.

The IDF said 20 Fajr or Grad missiles were fired by the Iranian Quds Force at its positions in the Golan Heights border area, several of which were intercepted by Israel's missile defence systems. No Israelis were injured.

Iranian officials offered no immediate comment on Israel's claim about the missile fire. Yesterday Lebanon's al Manar TV quoted the vice-president of Iran's National Security Committee as saying, ""Iran has no relation to the missiles that hit the enemy entity yesterday.""

The blistering Israeli response targeted what officials said was almost all of Iran's military infrastructure inside Syria, including dozens of weapons storage sites and intelligence centres used by elite Iranian forces, as well as Syrian air defence systems. The Syrian systems did not damage any Israeli planes.

""They need to remember the saying that if it rains on us, it'll storm on them,"" Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman told media yesterday. ""I hope we finished this chapter and everyone got the message.""

According to the Russian military, Israel fired more than 70 missiles during the attack.

Sana, Syria's state news agency, quoted a Syrian military official as saying Israeli missiles hit air defence positions, radar stations and a weapons warehouse, but claimed most incoming rockets were intercepted. It said the hostilities were triggered by Israeli fire over the border - something which has not happened since 1974. SOHR also said it believed the incident began with a volley of fire on the Qunietra region town of Baath.

According to Syrian army command three people died and two were injured in the attack. It was not immediately clear whether the casualties were Iranian or Syrian. SOHR said at least five Syrian soldiers were killed. Israel has largely managed to stay out of the complex seven-year-old conflict next-door, although the Golan Heights is restive and authorities have retaliated to occasional stray rockets with reprisals.

Around 100 Israeli airstrikes in Syrian territory in the last few years have aimed to prevent weapons smuggling to the Iran-allied Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, which also fights alongside Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's troops. Hezbollah, like Iran, is committed to the destruction of the Jewish state.

As Assad has slowly regained control of the country, tensions between Iran and Israel have ratcheted up, with Israeli officials warning they will not accept a permanent Iranian military presence in Syria.

Donald Trump's announcement earlier this week that his country would unilaterally withdraw from the landmark 2015 nuclear deal agreed between Iran and world powers has also set the Middle East on edge.

While Iran has said Israeli aggression against its troops in Syria will not go unheeded, Tehran's technical ability to hit back is limited.

Iranian officials are also wary of being drawn into a wider military escalation while they are trying to garner international support to save the nuclear agreement, which gave Iran sanctions relief in return for curbs on its nuclear programme.

Yesterday's flare-up came just hours after Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu returned from a visit to Moscow, where he and Russian president Vladimir Putin discussed Syria's war.

Russia militarily intervened in the conflict in 2015, turning the tide of the war in Assad's favour. Mr Netanyahu's office said after the meeting that Russia was ""unlikely"" to limit Israel's armed actions in Syria.",31,"While Iran has said Israeli aggression against its troops in Syria will not go unheeded, Tehran's technical ability to hit back is limited.

",524702,"The Middle East woke up to a more unstable and less certain world on Wednesday. Much remains unknown about the implementation and impact of US President Donald Trump's May 8 decision to reimpose all nuclear-related sanctions on Iran. But consequences will be multidimensional, and they will almost certainly hit the region a lot sooner than the up to six-month deadline Washington has given companies to cut commercial ties with Iran. Already, a full-scale war is threatening to break out between Israel and Iranian forces amid tit-for-tat strikes on military bases in Syria and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.

Another inflection point is Washington's already fraught relationship with Ankara. Next week, a US court is expected to deliver sentencing in a case implicating Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Iran sanctions violations, with potential billion-dollar fines looming ( EC Jan.12'18 ). In the coming days, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu is due to meet with new US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Washington. In addition to attempting to muffle the political fallout from the court case, the two have to address multiple points of confrontation -- including over Syria and its Kurds, arms purchases from Russia and US asylum for the Turkish cleric, Fethullah Gulen, accused of being behind the failed July 2016 coup attempt ( EC Apr.13'18 ).

Ankara's cooperation in Washington's aggressive new effort to isolate Tehran is critical. In addition to its regional clout, Turkey is the fourth-largest importer of Iranian crude, buying some 219,000 barrels per day over the last 12 months. But for Washington to have any hope of gaining traction in moderating Turkish commercial ties with Iran, some form of compromise is probably going to be needed on its other many points of dispute with Ankara.

So far, Tehran has said it will stay committed to its nuclear deal, provided Europe stays onside and the deal continues to deliver benefits. But on the face of it, Trump's announcement looks set to not just kill Iranian ambitions to attract Western investment to its upstream but also to smother already challenged regional energy projects -- particularly if the US decides to widen its sanctions campaign to include gas. Both Turkey, the biggest importer of Iranian gas, and Iraq, which also depends on Iranian gas, would bitterly oppose such a move, while Oman is also eyeing Iranian gas flows. Iraq also aims to export Kirkuk crude to northern Iranian refineries.

Meanwhile, increased aggression on the part of Iranian hard-liners and their regional proxies can be expected -- with the reimposition of Iranian oil sanctions as likely to play out in battlefields in Syria and Yemen as it is on international oil markets ( EC May4'18 ). That's already happening between Israel and Iran in Syria. For a still-fragile Iraq, the Iran decision is an unwelcome wildcard as it goes to the polls on May 12 ( EC Apr.27'18 ).

Opec, and US-Saudi, Tripwire?

Implementation of Washington's new Iran policy is likely to be a slower, more haphazard process than Trump would wish for ( related ). But there will be a supply impact, and it comes at a delicate time for Opec. The Saudi energy ministry on Wednesday vowed to ""mitigate the impact of any potential supply shortages,"" and Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said he would be ""connecting with other producers and major consumers over the next few days to ensure market stability.""

But Riyadh has a difficult balancing act. On a political level, it has been pushing for a concerted international effort against alleged Iranian regional aggression. But unwritten Opec rules dictate that any supply response to a shortage be consensual. In addition to destroying hard-won Opec unity, any unilateral Saudi action could threaten current cooperation with Russia-led non-Opec producers and unravel attempts to build a new Opec/non-Opec market management structure ( EC Mar.2'18 ). Gulf Opec sources tell <em>Energy Compass</em> that Riyadh will not back any action to respond to a short-term price spike and that a rollover is the most likely outcome of Opec's Vienna meeting in June ( related ).

Higher oil prices are already a problem in Saudi-US relations, with Trump last month tweeting complaints about Opec policy ( EC May4'18 ). The US leader told Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman during his April visit to Washington that he was losing sleep over the fact that Russia and Iran were reaping hundreds of millions of dollars a day in oil revenue as a result of high prices, one source tells <em>Energy Compass</em>. Saudi Arabia needs firm prices to balance the books and to lay the groundwork for a planned initial public offering (IPO) of Saudi Aramco. But price stability is paramount, and the last thing Riyadh wants is for high prices to spark such a surge in US shale output that it triggers another sustained price slump.

Trump has also voiced concern over Saudi Arabia's new energy alliance with Russia, the source adds. With historically frosty relations and opposing positions on Syria, Riyadh and Moscow are unlikely bed partners. But Russia's participation in the Opec/non-Opec deal and planned joint investments, including potentially a Russian stake in Aramco and Saudi investment in Russian LNG projects, serve both sides well. The danger is what happens if escalating international tensions prompt Washington to lean on Riyadh to ditch its new Russia alliance. 

This has been a good two years for Opec. Al- Falih has presided over a period of strong price recovery, organizational cohesion and unprecedented cooperation with non-Opec. But Trump’s Iran sanctions move threatens a cardinal tenet of Opec policy -- that oil and politics should not mix -- and how the organization responds is going to be critical.

",407213,"JERUSALEM (AP) - The Latest on the war in Syria, where Israel responded to a rocket attack by launching a wave of missile strikes on Iranian positions (all times local):

11:30 p.m.

Israel's U.N. ambassador is calling on the U.N. Security Council and the secretary-general to immediately condemn Iran's missile attack and demand that Tehran remove its military presence from Syria.

Danny Danon said in letters to the council and U.N. chief Antonio Guterres that ""the international community must not stand idly by while a tyrannical regime attacks a sovereign nation and continues to threaten the very existence of a member-state of the United Nations.""

Danon said ""Israel is not interested in escalation, but under no circumstances will we allow Iran to establish a military presence in Syria whose purpose is to attack Israel and to deteriorate an already fragile situation in the region.""

The Security Council, which is deeply divided over Syria, is highly unlikely to issue a statement and no council member has asked for a meeting on the missile attacks against Israel and Syria. Secretary-General Guterres urged ""an immediate halt to all hostile acts"" to avoid ""a new conflagration"" in the Middle East.

___

8:55 p.m.

The United Nations says Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is urging ""an immediate halt to all hostile acts"" and provocative actions to avoid ""a new conflagration"" in the Middle East.

U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters the U.N. peacekeeping force on the Golan Heights has maintained contact with the Syrian and Israeli military, ""urging both parties to exercise maximum restraint"" and abide by the 1974 cease-fire agreement.

He said the secretary-general followed ""with utmost concern"" overnight reports of missile launches from Syria targeting Israeli positions and retaliatory strikes by Israel and is relieved at Thursday's ""partial normalization of the situation.""

Dujarric said Guterres is ""very engaged"" and has been in contact ""with various people at various levels"" about the attacks.

8:25 p.m.

Israel's prime minister says the strike on Iran's military installations inside Syria sent a ""clear message"" to President Bashar Assad not to attack Israel.

Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday in a statement that ""we are in a continuous campaign"" and that ""Israel's military had carried out very extensive strike against Iranian targets"" in Syria.

Netanyahu said Syrian batteries fired at Israeli forces ""and therefore we struck them.""

He warned ""whoever attacks us - we will attack them sevenfold and whoever prepares to attack us - we will act against them first.""

The prime minister issued the statement as Israel's security cabinet was meeting, according to media reports.

Israel said the targets of the strikes, its largest in Syria since the 1973 war, included weapons storage, logistics sites and intelligence centers used by elite Iranian forces in Syria.

Chancellor Angela Merkel's office says the German leader has condemned an Iranian rocket barrage on Israeli positions in the Golan Heights in a phone conversation with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani.

She also reaffirmed European powers' continued support for the Iran nuclear deal.

Merkel's office said the two leaders spoke Thursday. It said in a statement that Merkel underlined the support of Germany, France and Britain for the nuclear deal so long as Tehran continues to fulfill its obligations under that agreement. Merkel advocated opening talks with Iran on its ballistic missile programs and its activities in countries such as Syria and Yemen.

The statement said Merkel condemned the overnight attacks on Israeli positions ""and called on Iran to contribute to de-escalation in the region."" It didn't say how Rouhani responded.

3:45 p.m.

The White House has condemned Iran's ""provocative rocket attacks from Syria against Israeli citizens"" and expressed strong support for ""Israel's right to act in self-defense.""

The statement from press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders comes after the most serious direct military confrontation between the two bitter enemies to date. The Israeli military on Thursday said it attacked nearly all of Iran's military installations in neighboring Syria in response to what it described as an Iranian rocket barrage on Israeli positions in the occupied Golan Heights.

Sanders says: ""The Iranian regime's deployment into Syria of offensive rocket and missile systems aimed at Israel is an unacceptable and highly dangerous development for the entire Middle East.""

A top official from the Arab Gulf country of Bahrain is defending what he says is Israel's ""right"" to defend itself after Israel launched overnight strikes on Iranian targets in Syria.

Foreign Minister Khalid bin Ahmed Al Khalifa wrote on Twitter Thursday that so long as Iran uses its forces and missiles to try and destabilize the region, ""it is the right of any country in the region, including Israel to defend itself by destroying sources of danger.""

Israel says Iranian rocket attacks on Israeli positions in the Golan Heights prompted the overnight strikes. Iran has not commented on the accusations.

Bahrain, a close U.S. ally, considers Iran a regional threat. The tiny island-nation accuses its Persian Gulf neighbor of arming and training Shiite Bahraini protesters with the aim of destabilizing the Sunni-ruled country. Bahrain has also welcomed President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from the nuclear accord with Iran.

Russia says the Israeli strikes on Iranian facilities in Syria have marked a dangerous escalation, urging both Israel and Iran to avoid provoking each other.

Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Moscow sees Thursday's strikes as a ""very alarming development.""

He noted that in contacts with the leadership of both countries, including a meeting Wednesday between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, ""we underlined the necessity of avoiding any actions that might be mutually provocative."" Netanyahu visited Moscow Wednesday to attend celebrations marking the WWII victory anniversary.

Israel said it struck dozens of Iranian targets overnight in response to a rocket barrage on Israeli positions in the Golan Heights, the biggest Israeli strike in Syria since the 1973 war.

Britain has condemned ""in the strongest terms"" a suspected Iranian rocket attack against Israeli positions in the Golan Heights.

In a statement Thursday, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson urged Iran to refrain from actions that could destabilize the region. Johnson also called on Russia to press the Syrian government, its ally, to work toward a broader political settlement.

The attack in the Golan prompted Israel to launch a wave of missile strikes at Iranian targets inside Syria. Iran has not commented on the exchange of fire. Syria's military said the Israeli strikes killed three people and damaged a number of its air defense units.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron are calling for de-escalation in the Middle East after an alleged Iranian rocket barrage on Israeli positions in the Golan Heights prompted Israeli strikes on Iranian targets in Syria.

Merkel and Macron met in Aachen, Germany Thursday on the sidelines of a ceremony where Macron was awarded a prize for contributions to European unity. The German government said they discussed events in the Middle East and called for ""level-headedness and de-escalation in the region.""

Merkel alluded to the two countries' support for the Iran nuclear deal. She said: ""We know that we face an extremely complicated situation here. The escalation of the last few hours shows it is truly a matter of war and peace, and I can only call on all involved to exercise restraint.""

Syria's military says overnight Israeli airstrikes killed three people, wounded two and destroyed a radar station, an ammunition warehouse, and damaged a number of air defense units.

Syrian Brig. Gen. Ali Mayhoub, who read the statement on Syrian television Thursday, says Syrian air defense systems had intercepted ""the large part"" of the incoming Israeli strikes.

Mayhoub did not say whether Iranian forces or Iran-backed militiamen were among those killed or wounded.

Israel's defense minister says the military struck ""nearly all"" of Iran's military facilities in Syria. A Syrian war monitoring group says the strikes killed at least 23 people, including five Syrian soldiers.

The Russian military says Israel fired more than 70 missiles at Iranian facilities in Syria and that Syrian air defenses shot down more than half of them.

Israel says it struck dozens of Iranian targets overnight in response to a rocket barrage on Israeli positions in the Golan Heights. It was the biggest Israeli strike in Syria since the 1973 war.

The Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement that 28 Israeli F-15 and F-16 fighter jets launched about 60 air-to-surface missiles during the two-hour raid early Thursday. It says Israel also fired over 10 tactical surface-to-surface missiles.

Russia is a key ally of Syrian President Bashar Assad, and has been waging its own air campaign on his behalf since 2015.

12:45 p.m.

A Syrian war monitoring group says Israeli attacks on several sites in Syria have killed 23 fighters, including five Syrian soldiers.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says Thursday the overnight attacks struck several military posts for Syrian troops and Iranian-backed militias near the capital, Damascus, in central Syria and in southern Syria.

The head of the Observatory, Rami Abdurrahman, said five Syrian soldiers, including two officers, and 18 militia fighters were killed. Abdurrahman says it is not immediately clear if Iranians were among those killed.

He says the toll is likely to rise because some of the wounded are in critical condition.

The Observatory says the strikes targeted suspected locations of the Lebanese Hezbollah group, as well as areas where Iranian advisers are believed to be based.

Noon

Syrian President Bashar Assad has accused U.S. President Donald Trump of saying one thing one day and the opposite the next, saying ""I don't think in the meantime we can achieve anything with such an administration.""

Assad spoke in an interview with the Greek Kathimerini newspaper published Thursday, before Israel carried out airstrikes in Syria in response to what it said was a cross-border rocket attack by Iranian forces.

He appeared to be referring to conflicting messages from the White House on how long it plans to keep American troops in Syria and its plans going forward.

Assad says wise Russian leadership has managed to avoid a full-blown conflict with Washington. He says: ""I hope we don't see any direct conflict between these superpowers, because this is where things are going to be out of control for the rest of the world.""

Both Russia and Iran have provided crucial military support to Assad's forces.

Israel's defense minister says the military has struck ""nearly all"" of the Iranian infrastructure sites in Syria.

Avigdor Lieberman says Thursday Israel responded fiercely to an unprecedented rocket attack by Iranian forces in Syria against Israel. He says no one was harmed in Israel and all the rockets were either intercepted or fell short.

Lieberman told the Herzliya Conference, an annual security gathering north of Tel Aviv, that ""if it rains on us it will be a flood on them.""

Israel attacked dozens of Iranian targets overnight in response to the rocket barrage on Israeli positions in the Golan Heights. It was the most serious military confrontation between Israel and Iran to date and Israel's biggest strike in Syria since the 1973 war.

CYRIL VANIER, CNN ANCHOR (voice-over): Outrage in Iran. Protesters hit the streets after the U.S. pulls out of the Iran nuclear deal.

Also a teenage girl sentenced to death in Sudan for killing her husband. She says he raped her in a horrific act.

Plus mixed messages: the president's lawyer suggests Mr. Trump tried to block the AT&T-TimeWarner merger but it turns out that depends on whom you ask.

Live from the CNN Center here in Atlanta, I'm Cyril Vanier. Great to have you with us.

(MUSIC PLAYING)

VANIER: So just days after U.S. President Donald Trump rejected the historic nuclear deal with Iran, anti-American emotions were on full display in the Iranian capital. The fate of the nuclear agreement now hangs in the balance.

Foreign minister Javad Zarif heads to Brussels next week to meet with his counterparts from France, Germany and the U.K. They'll be seeking ways to keep the deal alive without the U.S. If that last- ditch effort fails, however, Tehran warns it may start its uranium enrichment program on a, quote, "" industrial scale.""

Complicating this situation is the potential for military clashes between Iran and Israel. CNN's Ian Lee is in the Golan Heights, which Israel says was attacked by Iranian rockets earlier this week.

Ian, we keep seeing these flare-ups between Iran and Israel and we've kept seeing them since the beginning of the year and they've been getting worse.

So where is this headed?

IAN LEE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That's a question a lot of people are wondering, Cyril. You're right. We do see these flare-ups from time to time and they have gotten progressively worse. This just last week, we saw that worse flare-up as the two exchanged blows and Israel struck dozens of targets.

But right now, it has calmed down. But it's likely we'll see a flare- up again, as Iran says they're not going to abandon Syria and Israel says that, if they see something that crosses one of their red lines in Syria, which is essentially Iran establishing a strong military presence, a permanent military presence, then they say they reserve the right to act.

But both sides, both President Rouhani of Iran as well as the Israeli government officials have said they want tensions to ease.

VANIER: Let's talk Iran nuclear deal now. Tehran is trying to save this agreement, despite the fact that the U.S. pulled out.

So can this deal survive?

LEE: That's very difficult. And that's going to be up for the diplomats to decide, Cyril, if they can salvage this deal. Right now, we know that Iran's foreign minister, Zarif, is visiting different European capitals, members, signatories of this Iran nuclear deal to see if they can salvage it.

That includes the U.K., France, Germany, also talking with the Russians and the Chinese to see if they can move forward without the United States' part of it.

But it is going to be very difficult because the United States has said they're going to reassert sanctions and keep that pressure on them. And Iran has said, listen, if this deal does fall apart, then they're going to start enriching uranium on an industrial scale.

Now that doesn't mean that they're going to start their nuclear program and kick it back up, their weapons program, rather; but this does make for a more tense time.

VANIER: You've got another being piece of news coming your way in the next 48 hours or so. The U.S. embassy in Israel officially being moved to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv on Monday.

What is -- or what is going to be the Palestinian response to this?

LEE: Well, the Palestinians are outraged by the United States' decision to move. Essentially they said that the United States can no longer be a fair broker in the peace process, basically sidelining the United States, which has put the peace process really on freeze.

But when it comes to the embassy that day, specifically, we're expecting to see protests in the West Bank and in Gaza and specifically in Gaza. Over the past month and a half, every Friday, we've seen protests called the March of Return, where Palestinians inside Gaza go to the border.

And they say they want to return to lands that were lost during the 1948-49 war with Israel. And Israel said anyone who tries to get to that border fence, who tries to cross over it, that is a red line. And they have used lethal force, killing dozens of people. They've been criticized for that, especially with children being shot and killed and journalists. But Israel says, talking to some officials, they saying they're going to investigate those but they say that red line maintains itself.

[03:05:00]

LEE: So we're expecting this Monday to be the largest protests that we've in Gaza, which, Cyril, usually leads to the largest amount of violence.

VANIER: Absolutely, Ian Lee reporting live from the Golan Heights, thank you for your input, Ian, thanks.

VANIER: Let's bring in CNN global affairs analyst Kimberly Dozier.

Kimberly, does Israel feel it has a green light from the U.S. to move aggressively against Iran and Syria?

KIMBERLY DOZIER, CNN GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST: I think it's felt it had that for quite some time.

But on the Iranian side, there was a certain check to their action. They were staying within the lines, conducting a shadow war that, while they were aggressively supporting the Assad regime in Syria and supporting Houthi rebels in Yemen, they weren't overtly attacking Israel except a few furtive ventures with the drone in recent months.

But after Bibi Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel, had that display, where he had those thousands of documents that he had produced on television to show that Iran had been hiding, lying about its nuclear weapons program years ago, a display that was mostly thought to be aimed at president Donald Trump ahead of his decision about the Iran deal, we've seen Tehran take the gloves off.

VANIER: And Iran has been fairly quiet in its response about these Israeli strikes so far. For about 36 hours, it didn't even acknowledge them.

Is Tehran laying low on this because it's got bigger fish to fry, namely, saving the Iran nuclear deal?

DOZIER: Well, at this point they have some options. They could go with a Hezbollah reaction. Hezbollah has, Israel says, 100, 000-plus missiles trained south at Israeli territory. But --

(CROSSTALK)

VANIER: So that's the Shiite militia in Lebanon, in Southern Lebanon.

DOZIER: -- exactly.

But right now we've got European nations saying they want to try to save their side of the Iran deal. Britain, France, Germany have all said they're going to have a meeting to try to figure out if they can continue trade, if they can keep Iran economically with its head above water so that it's worth staying within the deal.

So from Tehran's point of view, that's a reason not to escalate militarily because the people within Iran are still waiting for the economic rewards of this deal.

VANIER: And this deal, can it really survive now that the U.S. has pulled out?

DOZIER: From what I'm hearing from European officials, they are scrambling to figure out how they can maintain some sort of trade ties. But from their perspective, they see slowly companies across Europe making the decision that, in the long term, the U.S. is going to make it too hard to do business with Tehran and, therefore, not worth it.

So from the diplomats I've spoken to, they're afraid it's a lost cause but at least they've got to try.

VANIER: So look, I've got to ask you this, then.

If the deal falls through, do that to unleash a more aggressive response from Iran in the region, then?

DOZIER: Probably so. The actions that we've seen so far, the missile volley over the border into the Golan Heights, may just be the first step. But Iran also knows that they've got to carefully calibrate this. If they go too far, they can get into an absolute fight with Israel.

So I think what you're going to see is harassment in various different locations, just pushing at the edges, which is something they've done very skillfully, while they hope their European allies can pull something off.

VANIER: Kimberly Dozier, CNN global affairs analyst, good to talk to you. Thank you.

DOZIER: Thank you.

VANIER: U.S. stealth fighter jets have intercepted a pair of Russian bombers in international airspace off the Alaskan coast. U.S. and Canadian military officials say the long-range Russian Bear aircraft were spotted Friday morning in the air defense identification zone around Alaska's western coast.

They eventually left the area. The last time U.S. jets intercepted Russian aircraft was a year ago this month.

And we have dueling messages coming from the Trump camp on the merger of media giants AT&T and TimeWarner, which, we should note, is CNN's parent company.

One message comes from the president's new lawyer, the other from the Justice Department. CNN's Hadas Gold lays out the facts.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

HADAS GOLD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Rudy Giuliani is causing another headache for the White House and now also the Justice Department this weekend. It is all because of comments he made in an interview with the ""Huffington Post.""

Giuliani told the ""Huffington Post"" that whatever lobbying Michael Cohen did on behalf of companies --

[03:10:00]

-- like AT&T, who paid him for consulting, as we've recently learned, did not work. Giuliani used the example of AT&T's proposed merger with TimeWarner.

Now the Justice Department blocked that merger. They sued to try to stop it because they said that it would harm consumers.

But Giuliani said in his interview with the ""Huffington Post"" that it was the president who denied that merger. Now that matters because the Justice Department is supposed to operate independent of the president.

And they said that they sued to block the merger without any sort of interference from the president or any sort of political bias.

Rudy Giuliani's comments fly in the face of that and, in fact, there was even a sworn affidavit from the head of the antitrust division for the Justice Department, saying that he was not influenced at all by the president or the White House or anybody involved.

But now Rudy Giuliani is saying that in fact Donald Trump himself was the one who denied this merger. The question now is what AT&T will do with this information. A judge is currently taking his time deciding whether this merger can go through or not. We're expecting that decision from him on June 12th.

But AT&T could issue new filings on appeal; they could try to bring up this political bias defense. It's really giving them another part of their arsenal that they can bring forth in this defense. But at the end of the day, it is just another Rudy Giuliani headache for the White House and the Justice Department -- this is Hadas Gold, CNN, Washington.

(MUSIC PLAYING)

(MUSIC PLAYING)

VANIER: Time is running out for a Sudanese teenager sentenced to death for murdering her husband while he allegedly raped her.

Noura Hussein's legal team has less than two weeks to appeal the court's sentencing decision. Her case has shone a spotlight on marital rape, which isn't recognized in Sudanese law. A man can legally force intercourse on his wife. Our Isha Sesay has been closely following this and she joins us now from London.

Isha, this is just a horrific story from beginning to end.

The question now, the most important question, can Noura Hussein survive this?

ISHA SESAY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That is the question that we're all contemplating and obviously, as people watch this story closely, are hoping --

[03:15:00]

SESAY: -- will be the outcome. But it is complicated by the fact that the sentence, the death penalty that was handed down was supported by her husband's family.

The husband's family basically could have seen Noura pardoned and a fine imposed but they specifically asked to see the death penalty imposed on Noura. In fact, when that judgment was handed down in the courtroom, clapped loudly and were quite jubilant at the fact.

Now as you've made clear, her lawyers have less than two weeks to appeal this. The hope is that, upon appeal, they will see that this was a forced marriage and will take into consideration the violence that Noura was subjected to and this death penalty will be done away with.

But it is really far from clear because to give context to our viewers, Sudan is a deeply patriarchal society. It is also a country, marriage is legal at age 10 and marital rape is legal.

So in the eyes of the culture, what Noura's husband did basically wasn't wrong. So it becomes very, very complicated to see how they would overturn this unless international pressure mounts to the point where the judges feels it's in the best interest of Sudan. VANIER: And there is right now significant support for her within the usual circles, which are NGOs, political activists.

But do we know -- and you started addressing this -- if there is support for Noura within Sudan?

SESAY: There actually is. This incident, this case has really shone a spotlight on the egregious treatment that women and girls face in many parts of Sudan. And Noura's courage, if you will -- and that's what it's been seen as by many women in Sudan, to basically run away, first of all, when the marriage was initially initiated, to run away to her aunt, where she stayed for three years and then to be brought back under false pretenses and married off, which resulted in this violent ending for her husband.

People see her as being incredibly brave and not being willing to accept the violent norms. And so a lot of women have stood up and expressed support for Noura. There are campaigns and there are petitions in the courtroom itself, when that death penalty handed down. It was full to overflowing, Cyril, with people from Sudan, standing up and saying she mustn't be put to death and that she herself was a victim in all of this.

VANIER: Isha, thank you so much for your update and for your great reporting. We're going to be following this. So there's a two-week clock that has started running as of yesterday. I was being told on an earlier show, speaking to somebody who's part of the campaign to help and support Noura Hussein.

Isha, we'll be hearing more from, you on this as well, thank you.

The World Health Organization is warning of a worst-case scenario as it ramps up its response to the current Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The WHO says there are now 32 suspected cases of the deadly disease. Two more have now been confirmed.

Officials say it will be tough and costly to stamp out the virus. The head of the WHO is traveling to the DRC in Central Africa this weekend to take stock of the situation.

And still in Africa, Kenyan authorities say the dam that burst on Wednesday and killed dozens of people was built illegally. At least 45 people are now confirmed dead and the local governor says 40 people are still missing. So that death toll may well rise.

Homes were swept away when the wall of the dam collapsed after heavy rain and flooding soaked the area. The Kenyan Red Cross estimates some 500 families have been affected.

But the threat of more explosions has again forced the closure of the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park.

And the final preparations underway for the wedding of the year. In just one week, Britain's Prince Harry and American actress Meghan Markle will tie the knot. And some royal watchers have already placed their bets on key wedding details. Max Foster, ever the gambler, has more.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

MAX FOSTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: A week to go and no official announcements about the wedding for days now. But that hasn't stopped the speculation. When there's a vacuum of information from the palace, we tend to revert to what people are betting on. So here's what Brits have been obsessing about this week.

First, the dress: Ralph & Russo are the firm favorites as the designers. Erdem and Christopher Bailey are the other front-runners. The palace insists they won't confirm or deny any of the rumors until Meghan actually steps out of the car at the church on the wedding day.

Maybe she's had two made and hasn't decided which to go for we could speculate for England.

Harry's outfit isn't causing nearly as much excitement of course but people are betting that Harry will be wearing a uniform on the day and money is also being placed on whether he'll keep his beard. Most thinking he'll shave it off for the big day.

Then the weather. This is the U.K. and we obsess about nothing more. There's a mini heat wave on its way. And bets are being placed on it being the hottest day of the year. Good news for Markle, who was brought up in the California sun. Less so for Harry, especially if he's in the stifling ceremonial uniform.

Finally, they aren't even married and people are already talking about the baby. Ladbrokes have slashed their odds on Markle making a pregnancy announcement by the end of this year.

Let's give them a chance, though, shall we, to enjoy their first big royal event together without any of this. Not long now -- Max Foster, CNN, London.

VANIER: And way before Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were even thinking about a walk down the aisle together, they were dealing with various struggles. CNN takes an inside look at their past and future in our special, ""A Royal Match: Harry and Meghan.""

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

ALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN ANCHOR: Harry wants to keep his relationship with Meghan private as long as he can. But just four months after that first date the news is out. And the paparazzi pounced once again.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: There was a photographer who got inside Meghan's house in Toronto. The paparazzi were camping on her mother's front lawn and following and harassing members of her family, anybody who knew her.

CAMEROTA: Despite starring in a TV show, Meghan is relatively unknown. Now the British press wants to know who she is and if she's fit for the royal family.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She was a woman who has been married. People are fascinated by the fact that she was divorced. People are fascinating by her background, her acting, a career woman.

How would that work being with someone in the royal family?

That's not what we've seen before.

CAMEROTA: They also have not seen someone biracial dating a member of the royal family.

[03:25:00]

CAMEROTA (voice-over): And some of the conversation is blatantly racist.

AFUA HIRSCH, JOURNALIST: There was one newspaper headline saying, ""Straight out of Compton,"" suggesting that she was from a gang-ridden neighborhood.

CAMEROTA: Afua Hirsch is a journalist and recently wrote a book about race, identity and belonging in Britain.

HIRSCH: Would Harry be dropping around for tea in gangland, which was very clearly racially loaded.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Another issue exploded which was the number of horrific social media racist comments began to flood in from the darkest, vilest corners of the internet.

VANIER (voice-over): CNN's special report, ""A Royal Match: Harry and Meghan,"" will air throughout the weekend on CNN. That includes Saturday at 8:00 pm Eastern time in the U.S. and Sunday evening at 7:00 in London. And of course we'll be carrying a lot of special programming for the event. That will be next weekend.

As President of the United States, every move you make is magnified, analyzed, scrutinized. And Donald Trump's body language is no exception, especially when he crosses his arms, which he seems to do a lot. Jeanne Moos went in search of answers about Mr. Trump's signature moves.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

JEANNE MOOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Some tend to think of President Trump as a man you'd better not cross. But there he is, crossing his arms.

TRUMP: And I think it's a disgrace.

MOOS (voice-over): In a very un-Trump like gesture.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is a negative defensive gesture.

MOOS (voice-over): As the author of ""Famous Faces Decoded"" noted...

DAN HILL, DECODING EXPERT: But his shoulders hunched together, it's extremely unusual for Trump to make himself look smaller than he is.

MOOS (voice-over): -- normally his gestures are expansive, assertive. But it seems frequently...

TRUMP: And my performance --

MOOS: -- President Trump's been performing with arms crossed.

TRUMP: Didn't say what that congresswoman said. Didn't say it at all.

MOOS (on camera): Crossed arms even made it on to the list of the 10 worst body language mistakes to make in an interview.

MOOS (voice-over): Arms crossed over your chest signal defensiveness and resistance. When an expert like Dan Hill watches the president react to that FBI raid...

TRUMP: Democrats, all, just about all...

HILL: Underneath all the bluster and the anger is also a real sense of being under siege.

MOOS (voice-over): When the president had to listen to a Democratic governor argue against arming teachers...

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Packing heat in first grade classes.

MOOS (voice-over): -- his crossed arms weren't just defensive.

HILL: But it's also dismissive. He shows contempt on his face.

MOOS (voice-over): Comedians have their own theory.

TREVOR NOAH, HOST, ""THE DAILY SHOW"": I think it's so cute that, whenever Trump is out of his depth, he gives himself away with that little hug that he gives himself for comfort.

MOOS (voice-over): It's become so common, Alec Baldwin has worked the gesture into his ""SNL"" impersonation.

KATE MCKINNON, COMEDIAN, ""JEFF SESSIONS"": Just like skunk stink on a bird dog, sir, I linger.

MOOS (voice-over): The crossed arms even inspired a parody product.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice-over): Do you have a president who's unrelieved?

TRUMP: No, get those lights off. Off.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are his arm movements a danger to those around him?

Then we've got a solution. The straitjacket suit for presidents. It looks just like a regular suit. No one has to know.

MOOS (voice-over): It has a way of tamping down the president's --

TRUMP: Fire and fury.

MOOS (voice-over): Jeanne Moos, CNN...

TRUMP: Why don't I just fire Mueller?

MOOS: -- New York.

Complicating this situation is the potential for military clashes between Iran and Israel.",0.24957621097564694,4.3207972049713135,3
"Will Iran execute or be targeted in an acknowledged national military attack outside of Syria involving Israel or any G7 nation between 23 August and 7 September 2018?
",1187664,"PRESIDENT Trump announced on May 8, 2018 that USA was withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal. Prior to making this decision, he had rejected the earnest pleas of America’s close allies in Europe, apart from many circles in USA. He did exactly what he had promised during his election campaign. He reiterated that the deal was “defective at its core and could not be fixed” i.e. renegotiated. Trump also ordered his officials to immediately begin the process of reimposing sanctions related to the deal. These will target critical parts of Iran’s economy, such as its energy, petrochemical, and financial sectors.

 The Iran deal, named as Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), was signed in July 2015 in Vienna by USA, UK, France, Germany, Russia, China and European Union. Under the agreement, Iran scaled back its uranium enrichment programme and promised not to pursue nuclear weapons. In exchange, international sanctions against Iran were lifted, allowing it to sell its oil and gas world-wide. However, secondary US sanctions against Iran were never lifted. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has said all along that Iran has met its nuclear commitments. Its monitors, who regularly inspect Iranian nuclear facilities, have verified that Iran is complying with the terms of the deal. Trump’s unilateral withdrawal from JCPOA and imposition of sanctions puts the US in immediate violation of the treaty, which says that the sanctions will remain lifted as long as Iran is complying with its terms. JCPOA was negotiated mainly by ex-US Secretary of State John Kelly and was hailed as a great achievement by President Obama. But Trump and other Republican Party leaders, apart from Israel, kept condemning the deal, which Trump described last week as “decaying and rotten.” They allege that Iran is secretly continuing its pursuit of nuclear weapons, and the deal does not cover Iran’s non-nuclear weapons and missile programmes. The Trump administration has many pro-Israel and anti-Iran officials. Antipathy towards Obama is a part of Trump’s psyche. As expected, Israel has enthusiastically welcomed Trump’s decision. Notably, Saudi Arabia has also supported the US decision, due to its current bitter rivalry with Iran and its apprehension that Iran has nuclear ambitions. Obama reaction was that Trump’s decision could leave the world less safe and even lead to another war in Middle East. Fortunately, Trump’s withdrawal from the nuclear deal has not killed it. Iran has shown restraint and President Rouhani has declared that Iran remains committed to the deal. The EU remains supportive of the deal, and has said that the US does not have the power to unilaterally scrap the agreement. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini has said that the group was “determined to preserve” the deal as long as Iran remained compliant. UK, France and Germany remain committed to the treaty. Russia and China have no intention of leaving it. Inspite of these assurances, there is concern that the size and influence of the US economy might induce EU to eventually fall in line. Iran is now seeking assurances from other signatories of the Treaty that they will remain faithful to its provisions. Accordingly, Foreign Minister Javad Zarif started a mission on May 12 to Beijing, Moscow and Brussels to urge them not to give in to US pressure to halt trade with Iran. An Iranian government statement said that Zarif had been “tasked with the duty of taking the necessary measures to obtain guarantees from remaining parties of JCPOA as well as Iran’s other economic partners.” Iran is seeking assurances that European, Russian and Chinese companies will continue to do business with Iran, even in the face of threats that such companies might have to face US sanctions. The statement warned that Iran was making preparations so that it could resume “industrial scale” uranium enrichment. Such a move would be seen as a breach of the nuclear deal and could put Iran on a collision course with the US and Israel. In a tweet, Foreign Minister ZarIf warned that the outcome of his tour to partner states of the treaty “will determine our response”. Iran has vital stakes in protecting the treaty. For instance, next week, Airbus is expected to announce whether it will continue with a 15 billion pounds deal to supply Iran with 100 commercial airliners. The Iranian national airline has a fleet of aging planes which must be replaced. Iran’s main exports are oil and gas which would be adversely affected by US sanctions. But India and China, the two largest importers of Iranian oil, had been allowed waivers in the years prior to the nuclear deal and might again be exempted. Trump’s decision could also have implications for the Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline project, which has so far probably not taken off due to fear of US sanctions. Trump’s unilateral withdrawal fom the Iran deal would increase tensions in the Middle East and fuel an arms race. Emboldened by Trump’s deision on the nuclear deal, Israel has become more aggressive. The latet dangerous development is possibility of a military showdown between Israel and Iran inside Syrian territory, and perhaps even beyond. Iran has military forces in Syria, fighting in support of the Assad regime. Last week, Israel made an air attack on Iranian military in Syria, followed by a reported Iranian missile attack on Israeli-held Golan Heights. On May 10, Israel launched “Operation House of Cards” and claimed its warplanes had hit 70 targets across Syria. Israeli Defence Minister Lieberman asked Syria to “get rid of the Iranians” to avoid further such air strikes. Though Russia, Iran and Assad regime have been acting together in Syria, an aide to President Putin has now been reported as saying that Russia has not agreed to supply sophisticated S-300 anti-aircraft missiles to Syrian regime. This in effect would leave Iranian troops in Syria exposed to future Israeli strikes, and create problems between Russia and Iran. Some reports suggest that the Iranian missile attack on Golan Heights could increase friction in Iran itself between the hard-liners and the moderates led by President Rouhani. Revolutionary Guards could have launched this rocket attack to sabotage nuclear deal and weaken Rouhani.",45,"The latet dangerous development is possibility of a military showdown between Israel and Iran inside Syrian territory, and perhaps even beyond.",0.2517431676387787,4.3207972049713135,2

",390665,"First there was the Trans-Pacific Partnership: just days after assuming the presidency in January 2016, Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the TPP, a trade deal he had referred to on the campaign as a ""rape of our country.""

Next was the Paris Climate Accord, which Trump pulled the US out of in June, six months after moving into the White House.

Now, a year later, he is pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal.

A month ago, Trump announced that he was reconsidering returning to the TPP after saying just a few months earlier that his administration is also considering reentering the Paris Climate Accord.

Then on Wednesday, a day after announcing that the US was leaving the Iran nuclear deal - also known as the JCPOA - Trump seemed to indicate what his ultimate plan was for stopping the ayatollahs' nuclear ambitions: either they sit down and negotiate a new deal, or ""something will happen."" What that ""something"" is, he did not say.

There seems to be a pattern here. Trump pulls out of deals that he campaigned against - likely because they were made by his predecessor Barack Obama - and then announces that he is ready to negotiate a new deal, one that will be better for America, simply because he - the ultimate dealmaker - will be making them.

In other words, it's not ideology that is pushing this, but rather a simpler equation. Trump ran a campaign based on a populist premise: Obama ruined America, and he was going to fix it by nixing all of the previous president's deals and making ones that are better. His decisions to pull out of the TPP, the Paris Accord and the Iran deal might be controversial and not fully supported by even his own staff, but he had no choice. He made promises to do so on the campaign trail.

That was also largely how the US media covered his announcement on Tuesday. Fox News, for example, ran a headline: ""Trump fulfills campaign promise, withdraws from Iran deal."" NBC News ran a similar headline: ""Trump kept his promise on Iran. But was it the right promise?""

In other words, it wasn't about the substance of the decision but rather that the president was doing what he said he would back when he was a candidate.

To know whether this was the right decision will require time, but it is interesting to note the striking overlap between those who oppose the Iran nuclear deal and those who are against the establishment of a Palestinian state.

The stances run basically along the same line of thinking: oppose conventional wisdom without offering an alternative. Many on the Right, for example, oppose the establishment of a Palestinian state. But when asked if that means they support a single state - for Israelis and Palestinians - they say no. So, what do they support? Unclear. Seemingly, just more of the status quo.

The same seems to be the case with many of the opponents of the JCPOA. They can speak for hours about the problems of the deal, but they offer no alternative. When asked whether they prefer that Israel attack Iran, they say of course not. They, too, seem to prefer more of the status quo.

Don't get me wrong. I, too, think that the Iran deal was highly problematic, primarily because it rewarded Iran while ignoring its ballistic missile program, the dangerous role it is playing in the region (Syria, Lebanon, Yemen and beyond), as well as the JCPOA's sunset clauses that will allow the Islamic Republic to obtain nuclear weapons with unprecedented ease once they kicks in.

Nevertheless, it also gave Israel and the Middle East some quiet and, in this region, even a day of quiet cannot be taken for granted.

Just look at the past week in Israel: Residents of the North were ordered into bomb shelters for the first time in years, 20 Iranian rockets were fired at the country, and the air force retaliated in one of the largest aerial operations in recent time. All in a span of two days.

It was this thinking, for example, that was behind Secretary of Defense James Mattis's support of the deal and IDF Chief of Staff Lt.-Gen. Gadi Eisenkot's recent declaration that from his perspective, the deal was working.

Both men recognized its many flaws, but also the deal's advantages of having a mechanism in place - even if flawed - that is stopping Iran (for now) from obtaining a nuclear weapon.

The problem is that whether they like it or not, Iran needed to be confronted, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was right that it is better now than later.

What happened late Wednesday night with the volley of 20 rockets fired at the Golan Heights is just a small taste of what Israel can expect if Iran is allowed to continue building up forces in Syria. It is further proof of why the government's approach to Syria might lead on the one hand to a larger conflict, but also of how it is preferable, from Israel's point of view, to fight Iran now rather than after it has built up more formidable forces in Syria.

What happens next with Iran's nuclear program remains unclear. There are a number of variables: When will sanctions go back into effect? What will Europe do? Will the US sanction European companies that do business with Iran? What will Iran do? Will it exit the deal or stay in it?

The bigger question is, what did Trump promise Israel? While Netanyahu was the deal's fiercest opponent, he would have wanted to receive some sort of assurance from Trump about the ""day after"" the accord fell apart. Will the US support Israeli action to stop Iran, including a unilateral military strike? Has the president promised Netanyahu that America will attack if Iran refuses to enter into a new - and better - deal that will forever stop its nuclear program?

If, for example, Trump's strategy is to threaten the use of military force if a new deal is not reached, then that actually has the chance of working. In the past, Iran showed a willingness to make the greatest concessions on its nuclear program when it feared military intervention. That was the case in 2003, when it temporarily suspended its weapons program after the US invaded Iraq. Iran feared it was next in line and did not want to provoke George W. Bush.

This was one of the main weaknesses of the Obama administration. No one - particularly in Iran - ever believed that Obama would use military force. As a result, Tehran was able to gain the upper hand in the negotiations that culminated in the flawed 2015 deal.

Trump is different. He has used military force twice in Syria and is unpredictable. What he says today might be meaningless by the time tomorrow's tweets roll along. Iran knows and fears this.

If nothing else, when it comes to Israel, Trump has proven himself to be a man who keeps his word. He might be working on a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians, but at least for the last 18 months, he has not tried to force it down Israel's throat. He has now exited the Iran deal - realizing a Netanyahu fantasy - and will be moving the US Embassy to Jerusalem on Monday. Every US president for the last 30 years promised to do that, but Trump is the only one to keep his word.

That is notable. Now the question is: what will his final word be on Iran and its nuclear program?",48,"Will the US support Israeli action to stop Iran, including a unilateral military strike?",0.2533416748046875,4.3207972049713135,2

",994568,"Analysis. By GIS/Defense & Foreign Affairs Indo-Pacific staff. Britain intends to deploy the HMS Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier battle group to the Pacific by 2021. By early May 2018, the Royal Navy had just concluded a series of military exercises with units from the Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force. The UK had already re-discovered its ""East of Suez"" role with its military deployments in Afghanistan over the past two decades, and had awakened its naval base in Bahrain, at Mina Salman. 

UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson in July 2017 spoke of Britain's desire for a renewed and strong relationship with Australia, and presumably with other Commonwealth members in the Indo- Pacific region, once it is free of its commitments to the European Union (EU). Now, of course, Britain must come cap-in-hand back to its family in the Indo-Pacific it had once dominated. Worse, despite the reality that many Commonwealth states in the Indo-Pacific have strong familial feelings for the UK (none more so than Australia and New Zealand, and, in the north-western Pacific, Canada), the UK has returned impoverished to the bosom of its family. It had progressively spent its vigor and resources on the EU, so that now its defense capabilities and budget meant that it would have to look its Indo-Pacific partners directly in the eye. 

Britain could not expect to resume its regional role with the same paternalism it had enjoyed even through the 1950s. 

That is not to say that the UK did not have some special assets and capabilities to offer its historical partners in the Indo-Pacific, including the viability of globally-capable British strategic nuclear weapons and doctrine. These still differ qualitatively and in their very nature to the more regionally-focused Indian and Pakistani nuclear capabilities. Even in its straightened condition, the UK does still have some of the characteristics of a global power, including -- if the thinking can be revived in Whitehall -- of a global strategic mindset. 

UK Prime Minister Theresa May and Foreign Secretary Johnson recognize that the future of Britain lies very much in its ability to revive commerce with the Commonwealth. And, in Australia, there is a sense that the timing is opportune as Canberra searches for an alternate option to being forced to choose between Washington and Beijing. 

The question is whether the UK can catch up to the new dynamic in the Indo-Pacific, largely driven by the People's Republic of China's expansion of strategic influence, built around the skeletal framework of the PRC's portion of the ""Great Silk Road"" on land and at sea, designed to dominate the Eurasian landmass, the Middle East, and Africa. Indeed, even the US and Australia are attempting to catch up, after decades of declining US credibility and under-performance, particularly in the Asia-Pacific and Africa. 

At the same time, the PRC has begun exercising greater reach into the South Pacific, to the point of causing some panic in Canberra. Reports in early April 2018 that the PRC was to establish a military base in Vanuatu were quickly denied by Beijing and the Government of Vanuatu. But the PRC did build, at the port of Espiritu Santo, the Vanuatu capital, the longest wharf in the South Pacific. Sources within various governments in the South Pacific, but particularly in Vanuatu and Samoa, say that, to all intents, they have been entirely bought off by the PRC Government.

That is clearly part of the strategic network of ports being acquired, largely through management contracts and leases, around the world, including the port of Darwin in northern Australia. 

The Vanuatu media scare, however, was sufficient for the Australian Government to further expand its aid to the South Pacific micro-nations, to which it has for decades already provided naval vessels under its Pacific Patrol Boats program. Australia has remained the top donor of aid in the South Pacific, and will now offer even more. It is also giving regional states 23 new-generation of Pacific Patrol Boats (the 39.5m/130ft LOA Guardian -class Pacific Patrol Boats Replacement program, replacing the older Pacific Forum -class delivered 1987-97)<1>. The PRC was able to win diplomatic recognition from a number of South Pacific nations by offering more aid than the Republic of China (ROC: Taiwan) was prepared to offer, but the reality is that the PRC has been offering favorable project and trade financing which has been more tempting even than the aid. It has now reached the level where the PRC essentially controls, or can seriously influence, the economies of several key South Pacific states. 

So, if Britain was to substantially improve its posture in the Indo-Pacific, it would need to significantly re-establish an intelligence focus on the region, well beyond what it can get from the Five- Eyes relationship (the UKUSA Accords providing privileged intelligence exchange between the US, UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand). The British loss of control over Hong Kong on July 1, 1997, took away its centrally-located intelligence hub, and any UK move to re-establish a regional capability would now have to depend on its relationships with allies, Australia in particular. 

This is going to be an expensive operation for the UK, and it comes at a time when there has been -- for the past five years or more -- a decline in real terms in British defense spending, even though the UK maintains defense spending above two percent of GDP. A planned increase in defense spending over the coming decade would still be too modest to facilitate a return to UK global influence if Britain was to maintain its present defense structure and commitments . Because of fluctuating currency values and inflation, the UK's proposed defense expenditure of GBP 36.9-billion for 2018-19 reflects a static situation in real spending terms from 2016-17. 

Why would Britain embark, then, on a major increase in defense and intelligence spending, unless it could see a material, long-term benefit, other than just the defense of the British Isles? Such thinking in Whitehall implies a return to an independent grand strategic posture. 

The question is whether this thinking is considered, or whether it is instinctual and romantic. There is a fundamental truth that trade and the flag can follow each other, and that both are implicitly bound in the prestige which each can bring to the other. See ""Prestige = Legitimacy = Sovereignty = Power"" in Defense & Foreign Affairs Special Analysis, May 11, 2018. The growth in the PRC's strategic reach, in economic as well as influence terms, has implicitly engaged this reality, and, indeed, the PRC's growth in the Middle East and Africa -- from Iran to Cape Town -- has been explicitly at the expense of, first, the declining UK presence and the declining US presence which had assumed some of the British strategic space after World War II. 

There is no doubt that the arrest in the global decline of Britain -- or the attempt to arrest it -- has been the result of the Brexit vote of June 2016 to remove the UK from the EU. And yet there has been no explicit attempt by British leaders to articulate a post-EU strategic posture for the UK. 

When that articulation begins to be formulated, it would have to include a serious, independent approach to resuming British influence and trade in Africa and the Middle East. It is worth bearing in mind, of course, that Britain's rise to strategic global posture was not the result of an orderly plan; the growth was organic. But any attempt to revive the global posture would need to consider priorities, and the limited funding available. More importantly, it would need to empower the UK private sector to create that re-assertion, but coupled absolutely with the support and prestige of the Crown. 

All of this would require a re-evaluation of the 20th Century priorities which drove the UK to its defensive position. The containment of Spain, France, Germany, and the post-Russian Soviet Union necessitated, ultimately, that Britain subordinate its initiative: to contain it within the alliances which helped it through the world wars, and then within the North Atlantic Alliance. 

The UK need not express an immediate or explicit desire to minimize, or withdraw from, some of its present confederal structures. But at least, privately, the UK leadership should be asking: Should Britain leave NATO? Should it leave the UKUSA Accords? There is no doubt that these alliances confer great advantage on the UK in some situations which absolutely, because of scale, require coalition warfighting capabilities. At the same time, they also rob most of the members of these alliances of initiative, and merely serve to reinforce the control of the leaders of the alliances. 

If it is again thinking globally, Whitehall needs to ask: Does it need Moscow to contain Beijing? Or Beijing to contain Moscow? And what can NATO do to achieve what the ""new UK"" wants? And what is it that it wants?

",947446,"More than 100 parliamentary seats that backed Brexit in the 2016 referendum have flipped to support staying in the EU, according to a major new poll.

Constituencies in Wales and the North have seen the largest swing, according to YouGov research commissioned by Hope Not Hate and pro-EU group Best for Britain.

The constituencies of Brexiteers Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and Jacob Rees-Mogg are among the 112 areas where opinion has changed in favour of staying in the EU.

But support for Brexit has increased by nearly half a percentage point in europhile Ken Clarke's Rushcliffe constituency.

The figures show the national mood has shifted to 53% support for Remain and 47% for Leave.

Constituencies with the biggest swing to Remain

Dr Philip Lee, a minister who resigned to oppose the government's Brexit plan, said the figures reflected the realisation that Brexit Britain ""will not be the land of milk and honey that voters were promised"".

""It's not too late,"" he added.

""The British people should have the final say. Brexit must be put back to the electorate in the form of a people's vote.""

Prime Minister Theresa May has previously ruled out a referendum on the final terms of Brexit.

She is aiming to strike a deal with Brussels by autumn, that will then be voted on by MPs in Britain, and the EU27.

Mrs May last month hailed her Chequers plan as a document that ""delivers on the Brexit people voted for"".

",156786,"CONFIDENCE in British Prime Minister Theresa May's handling of Brexit is plummeting, as concerns about the policing of the Border mount.

A new poll, carried out by the ORB International pollster, shows confidence in the Tory leader has dropped considerably, with 60pc of UK voters not confident Mrs May will get the right deal.

The findings come as concerns emerged both here and in the UK about policing in the event of a hard Brexit or a no-deal exit.

Gardaí in Co Louth have said a portacabin which houses a station less than 2km from the Border ""will not last more than a week,"" in the event of a hard Brexit, according to the Garda Representative Association (GRA) rep for the area, Derek O'Donoghue. The station is rotting away, according to members stationed there, and it is feared it will not be able to support increased resources in the event of a hard Brexit when up to 100 additional gardaí could be needed in the region.

Superintendent Gerry Curley said irrespective of whether there is a hard Brexit, ""the Drumad area is probably one of the most significant areas along the whole Border"" and called for facilities there to be addressed.

He also said there were concerns about the effect of a hard Brexit on Border policing and the issue of dissident Republicans.

Exploit ""There is no doubt a hard Brexit could cause an upsurge in dissident activity because unfortunately those individuals seem to exploit situations like that.""

Police chiefs in the UK have also raised a red flag over concerns about public safety in the event of the UK leaving the bloc without an agreement.

A leaked letter, reported by the 'Guardian' newspaper, raised concern over the loss of access to cross-border investigative powers overnight. Increased speculation over the weekend that the UK will crash out, sparked by comments by high-profile Brexiteers, was downplayed by Downing Street yesterday.

Trade minister Liam Fox said in an interview with a Sunday newspaper he believed that the prospect of the UK crashing out with no deal had risen to 60:40.

The comments helped push sterling down to an 11-month low. A spokesman for Mrs May said Mr Fox was right to highlight the risk of Britain crashing out. However the spokesman said: ""We continue to believe that a deal is the most likely outcome because reaching a good deal is not only in the interests of the UK, it is in the interests of the EU and its 27 members"", Mr Fox had laid the blame at the door of the EU for the heightened chances of a crash out, due to its ""intransigence"".

However, the European Commission has defended its performance, saying it is working 24/7 on the negotiations.

A spokeswoman for the commission said negotiators are working ""day and night, 24/7, for a deal"".

""We are working constructively, day and night, to reach a deal with the UK and I think this is also reflected in the fact the next negotiation round is scheduled for the 16 and 17 of August,"" she said.

""An agenda will be published in due course and the chief negotiator is... based on the negotiating position agreed by the 27 member states and that's reflected in the European Commission guidelines.

""It will be at official level but it will be followed very soon at a political level because, as you know, we are working day and night, 24/7, for a deal.""

With MSPs poised to reject legislative consent for the EU Withdrawal Bill today, the First Minister said the dramatic constitutional rift risked breaking all trust between the two governments.

Speaking in London last night, Sturgeon said: ""What happens after the vote, the ball is in the UK Government's court. They have to decide to ignore the views of the Scottish Parliament or listen and try very hard to get a deal that closes the gap that remains between us.

""It strikes me that if the UK Government decide to carry on regardless, that we were right not to take this on trust.""

The SNP say the Brexit bill would give Westminster the power to ban Holyrood from legislating on devolved areas for up to seven years.

Sturgeon insisted she was ""trying to cling to hope"" that agreement over powers returning from  Brussels could still be found but added: ""We're at three minutes to midnight.""

The SNP are likely to be joined by Scottish Labour, the Lib Dems and Greens in rejecting Scottish consent for the EU Withdrawal Bill, leaving Tory MSPs isolated.

With consent held back, May will have to rip up nearly two decades of convention on devolution and ignore Holyrood if she wants to press on with her plan.

Scottish Tory constitution spokesman Adam Tomkins last night made a last-ditch plea to the other parties in the Scottish Parliament to back May's proposal.

Highlighting the deal Westminster reached with the Welsh Assembly last month, he said: ""It's profoundly regrettable that we don't have a deal in Scotland to allow us to move on.

""The blame for that lies entirely with the SNP.

""Nicola Sturgeon has refused to compromise. It's not in Scotland's interests that the SNP prefer picking fights to making a deal.""

Scottish Labour Brexit spokesman Neil Findlay said his party will defend devolution.

He added: ""The Tories' shambolic handling of this key area for Scotland is pushing the case towards the Supreme Court.""

Green party co-convenor Patrick Harvie said: ""The Tories' understanding of the word 'consent' is a farce.

",219248,"THERESA MAY is going all out for her version of Brexit after Government whips told her it is the only option that would get through a parliamentary vote, Eurosceptic Tory MPs fear. 

It comes as 'leave'-supporting ministers have raised concerns that the Prime Minister could bypass her Brexit ""war Cabinet"" by requesting the full Cabinet to support her controversial plan for a customs partnership with Brussels.

Mrs May has delayed plans to discuss Britain's future customs arrangements with her Brexit sub-committee on Thursday, after he was outnumbered six to five last week by those in opposition to the plans.

Brexiteers have warned her she could face a revolt and a leadership contest if she attempts to stamp out anyone who opposes the plan.

Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, has described the customs partnership proposal as ""crazy"", but No10 insisted Mrs May still has complete confidence in him.

One Cabinet source said: ""There is a growing feeling that the Prime Minister is going to avoid another confrontation with the Brexit sub-committee on a customs partnership, which she would lose, and just put the matter to a full Cabinet meeting where she has the numbers to win.

""But it would only get through Cabinet because people haven't yet grasped just how much of a sell-out it would be.""

Earlier this month, the European Research Group, which is made up of 60 Eurosceptic Tory MPs, posted a 30-page dossier to Mrs May outlining why the plan would be unworkable.

Number 10 later said the plan was currently ""dead"", but the Prime Minister has revived it and insists the scheme is still an option, alongside the alternative ""Max Fac"" plan, which uses new technology to avoid a hard border with Europe.

Boris Johnson has called the plans ""crazy""                                            

But Eurosceptic Tory MPs fear Mrs May has been given no option but to go all out for her version of Brexit, by pursuing the customs partnership proposal, after Government whips have said it is the only option that get them through a parliamentary vote.

A former minister said: ""It would be a pyrrhic victory for her if that were to happen, because she might well find herself facing a leadership contest as a result.""

It is understood that dozens if Tory MPs have called for a leadership election in letters sent to Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the Conservative 1922 Committee of backbench MPs.

If the number of letters reaches 48, Sir Graham would be obliged to hold a vote of no confidence.

The former minister said: ""No-one is talking about an organised coup at the moment, but she might find that if she forces the customs partnership through, a couple of letters might go in and that could be enough to trigger a vote.""

When the full Cabinet met on Tuesday, Brexit was not discussed.

And the Brexit sub-committee meeting on Thursday is expected to discuss preparations for a ""no deal"" Brexit, rather than customs options.

Dominic Grieve, Conservative former attorney general, said the foreign secretary's choice to criticise the proposal was ""regrettable"" but said he could see why the Prime Minister was willing to put up with his ""outbursts"".

Mr Grieve told BBC Radio 4's World at One: ""I don't think he is in any way inhibited by normal propriety in government.

""I have an old fashioned view of what cabinet responsibility entails, which is that the discussions within Government on any given matter are confidential until the time is reached that the Government has a collective position.

""And if you don't like the collective position you at that stage have to resign...

""I can well understand that seeing the difficult issues that we are having to confront, which are very divisive, the Prime Minister should accept these rather extraordinary bursts of misbehaviour by Boris.""

Sources close to Mr Johnson have said he isn't contemplating resignation as he believes he holds greater influence inside the Cabinet than on the outside.

",1070082,"Sputnik spoke to Janice Atkinson, Independent Member of the European Parliament to find out more about the policy of the British government on Brexit.

Sputnik: So Prime Minister Theresa May issued a plea for unity in an opinion piece in the Sunday Times newspaper, calling on Brexiteers to ""trust me to deliver."" ""I will not let you down,"" she wrote… Janice, taking this plea into account as well as last week's rebellion in the house of Lords, should the British people trust Theresa May?

Janice Atkinson: No because we don't know what she stands for. It's been two year since we voted to leave and we haven't heard from her [Theresa May] what she actually believes in. I read this piece in the Sunday times and I think she has a reason to be optimistic… she doesn't actually realize how powerful she is; there are basically two scenarios to go forward and deliver the Brexit that 17.4 million people voted for. One, she can just walk away and revert to the WTO rules and trade as an independent sovereign country, or we can do that and give them the EU notice and go to WTO rules and they will quickly produce a free trade deal. They have to economically; the EU is fighting for its very survival. They've got elections in exactly a years' time for the EU parliament and the parliament will come back in a very different makeup because all over Europe and the EU countries are rejecting the federalism that the EU stands for. She [Theresa May] is in a very powerful position to get her cabinet onside and deliver Brexit that we voted for.

Sputnik: It's not just Theresa May who's having problems with centralizing her party over Brexit, Labour are also having trouble finding common ground amongst party members and MPs. What does this indicate? Is Brexit at risk of being diluted by both Labour and the Conservatives?

Janice Atkinson: Well consecutive Conservative and Labour governments have given our sovereignty away to the EU, so they don't really know how to govern they just become a vassal state of the EU. I have no idea where Labour are in this, you've got Emily Thornberry appearing on television saying one thing and Corbyn saying another. I think Labour now have issued 16 different positions on Brexit, so they're just not a credible opposition let alone a government in waiting. Mrs. May has to bring her party together, if she doesn't and doesn't deliver us [the British people] the Brexit we want and I hear the rumours around Westminster, they are recognizing that the polls are now saying that 70% of the British people want her to deliver Brexit and get on with it, rather than trying to keep a few hardline remainers on her side.

Sputnik: With less than a year to go before Britain leaves the European Union, at the rate we're going, can we expect Brexit to be delivered on time and if not what will the consequences be for Theresa May and the Conservatives?

Janice Atkinson: We've given notice that we will be leaving on March the 29th 2019, the clock is ticking. Theresa May has had two years to deliver a Brexit plan and this government has been woefully inadequate in their plans. Even the treasury, who is headed up by an ultra-remainer has not made contingency plans to just walk away and give the department international trade the cash they need to strike these free trade agreements. I think this country is at a tipping point where Theresa May better get her act together and Liam Fox better start signing those Trade Agreements because I think we're going to be walking away. I hope for one and I know a lot of MEPs and MPs agree with me, that we need to just walk away. Britain is going to be a proud trading nation and we're going to make Britain great again by walking and going to WTO rules. At that point the EU will sit up and listen because economically they have to.

",1137788,"NICOLA Sturgeon has warned Theresa May that if she ignores today's Holyrood vote on the Brexit bill, it will prove she cannot be trusted.

The First Minister claimed the Brexit process had ""strengthened the democratic case"" for Scottish independence, but she declined to say if the argument for holding a second referendum on Scotland's future had also been boosted, suggesting people would ""have to wait and see"" regarding her future decision.

And Ms Sturgeon, speaking at a Reuters Newsmaker event in the City of London, claimed there was now a ""realistic possibility"" that MPs could force the Prime Minister into a U-turn to keep Britain in the European customs union.

Today, a majority of MSPs are expected to reject giving consent to the EU Withdrawal Bill, which they believe is a ""power-grab"" by Whitehall.

The FM said that, far from the SNP Government being isolated on the Brexit bill as Whitehall has suggested, the vote today - expected to withhold consent and also be backed by Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Greens - would prove it was the Conservatives and Mrs May's Government who were isolated on the issue.

Ms Sturgeon said with time almost out that, at ""three minutes to midnight"", there was still a path to a deal with the UK Government.

""What happens after tomorrow, the ball will be very much in the UK Government's court; they have a decision to make as to whether they are going to ignore the views of the Scottish Parliament or listen to those views and try very hard to get a deal and to close the gap that remains between us.""

The FM said some progress had been made in the talks, but much of that would be in an agreement rather than in legislation, so she and her colleagues were being asked to take a lot on trust.

""It strikes me that if the UK Government decides after tomorrow to carry on regardless, it demonstrates we were right not to take some of this on trust,"" she noted.

Ms Sturgeon accepted that Whitehall asking for Holyrood's consent on issues normally devolved was a constitutional convention, but she said if UK ministers ignored the Scottish Parliament's view, then they would ""go into uncharted constitutional territory"" and it would ""set a very bad precedent and a very bad example"".

The SNP leader claimed that the Brexit process had ""strengthened the democratic case"" for Scottish independence, noting: ""It stands to reason when two of the nations of the UK vote to remain, but a majority across the UK votes to leave and we face the prospect of being removed from the EU against our democratic will, then clearly that raises profound democratic question.""

On the issue of a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said there had to be greater clarity on the way forward and people would have to ""wait and see"" what her decision would be.

The FM denounced the ""absurdity"" of the UK Cabinet's deadlock on future customs arrangements but said: ""There's a real possibility - and the SNP can be part of this in the House of Commons - of forcing the UK Government... for remaining effectively in the current customs union.""

Meanwhile, Neil Findlay, Scottish Labour's Brexit spokesman, said the continuing ""problems"" with the Brexit bill meant his party would vote against giving consent. 

He said: ""The Tories' shambolic handling of this key area for Scotland is pushing the case towards the Supreme Court. The people of Scotland want this mess fixed and even at this late stage there is still time to do that.

""That is why this week Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard",1,"NICOLA Sturgeon has warned Theresa May that if she ignores today's Holyrood vote on the Brexit bill, it will prove she cannot be trusted.

therefore. That is what we are saying in the article today - MPs are there to debate bills, propose amendments, David Davis says that amendments can improve the legislation and shape what is an enormous national challenge for this country. We hope that the Prime Minister will accept that challenge and work with parliament to get the best Brexit deal. 

In terms of that deal, we saw the Lords vote for an amendment which means that we would stay in the single market. Will you vote for that amendment when it comes back to the Commons? I haven't made up my mind on that, to be honest. There are people in my party, the Wimbledon MP wrote an article yesterday, who have been talking about this very much.

",627026,"UK PRIME Minister Theresa May might finally face down her Tory detractors over the Northern Ireland Border.

Her Brexit war cabinet is meeting on Tuesday to discuss post-Brexit solutions to customs arrangements aimed at ensuring no physical borders are erected on the island of Ireland.

This time, Mrs May (inset) has split the cabinet into two teams and told them to thrash out their arguments for and against two specific proposals - a customs partnership, or technologyheavy ""max-fac"" (maximum facilitation).

""She's hoping there'll be agreement on customs union and the cleverest person among them, David Lidington (minister for the cabinet office), is on the max-fac team, and hopefully he'll tell them why it's so wrong,"" said a Tory rebel insider.

Also on that team, however, are Brexiteer Environment Secretary Michael Gove and Trade Secretary and Brexit idealogue Liam Fox.

The second team is comprised of Brexit Secretary David Davis, Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley and Business Secretary Greg Clarke. It will examine Mrs May's preferred option of a customs partnership which would see the UK collect tariffs from goods coming in to the EU through Britain on behalf of Brussels. But Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson rejected this notion as ""crazy"" days ago, and Mrs May doesn't have the majority support on it.

""The only option is to get Defence Minister Gavin Williamson and Home Secretary Sajid Javid to change their minds and vote with the customs arrangement when the time comes. They'd have to both do it, otherwise the rebels between them would then find themselves in pole position in the next leadership battle. It's literally that volatile and ridiculous within the Conservative Party,"" said the source.

Meanwhile, Irish sources are pointing to the fact there are just seven weeks to go before the next agreed deadline, in which the EU has said there had to be ""substantial progress"" on the Border. ""The British government is still entertaining the max-fac solution. It is a fantasy solution to trade only that ignores the peace on the Irish Border. It'll be a major achievement to get agreement among themselves, never mind us,"" said an Irish Brexit source.

Dublin believes if the UK was at least on the right track, then ""we could give them the encouragement to develop their ideas further"", even though the customs partnership idea is indeed complex.",1,"UK PRIME Minister Theresa May might finally face down her Tory detractors over the Northern Ireland Border.

Is an issue that has been dominating discussions in the United States recently and some American companies are rethinking supply chains. The Financial Times reports of strained relations between Ankara and Washington, resulting in the Turkish lira losing value against the dollar. America wants Turkey to release US pastor, Andrew Brunson. That is certainly a big concern as the diplomatic rift continues between both sides. 

And the Gulf News reports on the first Muslim woman set to be elected to the US Congress. 42-year-old Rashida Tlaib, who is a fierce critic of President Trump, has been selected to run for a safe Congressional seat in Michigan. Now, Kasia, what is trending in your part of the world? The transfer window for the English Premier League has been dominating social media. If you are football fan, do just check out our website. And I'm going to take you to Pakistan now. Imran Khan generated controversy on the campaign trail for his comments about feminism. It's expected he will be sworn in next week as the country's new Prime Minister. So what do women want for their new leader? Maybe those comments were taken out of context, maybe he did not mean to say those. I want to assume that he was trying to play to the right, which is what a lot of politicians in Pakistan have to do. I say his views could have been better well rounded and better articulated. He needs to probably look at more women empowerment and addressing the subject accordingly. I really would love to see 50% women representation in the Cabinet. Work on electoral reforms. He should be focusing on human development projects and he should also be focusing on macroeconomic stability. I also want him to focus on the increasing polarisation and hatemongering in the society. The one thing that concerns me is his history with regards to blocking women representative legislation or women-friendly legislations. There is no proven corruption against him. What I don't like is that sometimes there is this - too much self-promotion. Maybe it's part of politics. I also very much like his idea of promoting, and not believing in the status quo. Festival organisers in Malaysia have removed two portraits of LGBT activists from a public photo exhibition on the orders of a government minister. Nisha Ayub is a transgender activist whose portrait was among those taken down. She talked to me about its removal. First of all, it started from a viral page, that happened on social media and I expected that it would be public and, of course, they would bring the two speakers, which eventually they did.

"Will American pastor Andrew Brunson leave Turkey before 8 September 2018?
",782580,"The embattled Turkish lira tumbled over 16 percent to new record lows against the dollar as strains with the United States intensified, but President Recep Tayyip Erdogan defiantly proclaimed Turkey would emerge victorious in an ""economic war"".

Compounding the lira's agony, President Donald Trump said Friday he had doubled steel and aluminium tariffs on Turkey, noting that relations between the NATO allies were ""not very good"".

The lira's plunge on Friday is one of the most serious economic crises that Erdogan has faced since coming to power in 2003 in the wake of a financial crisis in 2001 that brought the economy to near meltdown.

""The plunge in the lira which began in May now looks certain to push the Turkish economy into recession and it may well trigger a banking crisis,"" said Andrew Kenningham, chief global economist at Capital Economics.

The currency turbulence coincides with the most bitter dispute with the United States since the 1974 Turkish invasion of Cyprus, which so far shows no sign of abating.

Fears over contagion even pushed global equity markets lower, with some European banks coming under heavy selling pressure due to their exposure to Turkey.

AFP/File / Brendan Smialowski, Gianluigi GUERCIAUS President Donald Trump and Turkish counterpart President Recep Tayyip Erdogan 

The lira was trading at 6.47 to the dollar at 1900 GMT, a loss on the day of 16.6 percent. Earlier it had fallen as much as 22 percent.

""The last time I can remember a currency exploding into a similar acceleration of weakness to what we have seen in the past 24 hours is the Russian ruble crisis that transpired late in 2014,"" said Jameel Ahmad, head of currency strategy at FXTM.

The tumult also affected Wall Street, which finished the week on a sour note, with the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all finishing down on Friday.

– 'National fight' –

But Erdogan, who had remained unusually silent until now as the lira crisis mounted, urged Turks to take matters into their own hands.

""If you have dollars, euros or gold under your pillow, go to banks to exchange them for Turkish lira. It is a national fight,"" he said.

""This will be the response to those who have declared an economic war,"" he said, blaming Turkey's woes on what he described as an ""interest rate lobby"" seeking to push the country to higher rates.

AFP / ADEM ALTANTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called on Turks to support their struggling currency by exchanging any foreign money

Erdogan had raised eyebrows Thursday when he appeared to invoke divine intervention, saying: ""If they have dollars, we have our people, we have our right and we have Allah!""

Turkey remains at loggerheads with the United States over the detention for the last two years of American pastor Andrew Brunson and a host of other issues.

Trump intensified the alarm on financial markets with his new tweet doubling the tariffs, noting for good measure the lira was sliding ""rapidly downward against our very strong Dollar!"".

""Our relations with Turkey are not good at this time!"" he added.

But Erdogan said Turks should not be alarmed by exchange rate movements. ""The dollar, the mollar, will not cut our path,"" said Erdogan, using a figure of speech he repeatedly uses to mock something.

Turkey had alternatives ""from Iran, to Russia, to China and some European countries"", he added.

Erdogan also Friday held telephone talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, discussing economic and trade issues as well as the Syria crisis, the Turkish presidency said.

The Turkish foreign ministry hit back at Trump's comments, saying that the ""only result will be harming our relationship"" and vowing unspecified retaliation.

It added that Trump's remarks were ""not possible to reconcile with state seriousness"".

– 'Increasingly unlikely' –

Markets are deeply concerned over the direction of domestic economic policy under Erdogan with inflation at nearly 16 percent but the central bank reluctant to raise rates in response.

TURKISH PRESIDENTIAL PRESS SERVICE/AFP / Murat KULATurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Turks should not be alarmed by the currency crisis 

UBS chief economist for EMEA emerging markets Gyorgy Kovacs said a giant rate hike of 350-400 basis points would be ""consistent with real rate levels that in the past helped to stabilise the currency"" but warned a deal to normalise ties with the US may also be needed.

And it remains unclear if the bank would be willing to sharply lift rates, with analysts saying the nominally independent institution is under the influence of Erdogan, who wants low rates to keep growth humming.

After winning a June election with revamped powers, Erdogan tightened his control over the central bank and appointed his son-in-law Berat Albayrak to head a newly-empowered finance ministry.

""President Erdogan's strengthened powers under the new presidential system have made it increasingly uncertain whether policymakers will be able to act to stabilise the economy,"" said William Jackson, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics in London.

AFP / OZAN KOSEMarket analysts say the Turkish currency needs a rate hike to stabilise

Concerns mounted Friday after a report in the Financial Times that the supervisory wing of the European Central Bank had over the last weeks begun to look more closely at eurozone lenders' exposure to Turkey.

The report said the situation is not yet seen as ""critical"" but Spain's BBVA, Italy's UniCredit and France's BNP Paribas are regarded as particularly exposed.

Albayrak, who formerly served as energy minister, on Friday announced what he has described as a ""new economic model"" for Turkey but he focused on macro-economic issues and steered well clear of tackling the currency crisis.

The lira's plunge has featured remarkably little on Turkish television channels and newspapers — most of which after recent ownership changes are loyal to the government — with media focusing instead on recent flooding by the Black Sea.

The building is said to have contained munitions belonging to an arms trafficker. Idlib is the last major rebel-held area, and is expected to be the next target for Syrian Armed Forces. 

Turkey's central bank has announced measures to try to stabilise the country's plunging currency. The lira has been at record lows, amid a trade spat with the United States. Lebo Disekko reports. Turkey's President stood defiant on Sunday, telling supporters the fall of his country's currency was a political plot against Turkey. As the event continued, he repeated a less than thinly veiled threat to a Nato ally - the United States. TRANSLATION: Our response to those who wager trade war against the whole world and include our country in that would be heading towards new markets and new alliances. Despite the tough talk, the lira has continued to weaken. It's fallen 40% so far this year, against the US dollar.

In anger and frustration, as thousands gathered to demonstrate against a protest by white nationalists, right in the centre of the capital, and within sight of the White House. Exactly a year before, the same right wing group had held a controversial protest in Charlottesville, in Virginia. A woman was killed when a car was driven into a crowd of counter protesters. Holding this event on the anniversary of Heather Heyer's death was seen by many as deliberately provocative. Very emotional day. There was a couple of signs that said for Heather, and we had a moment of silence for Heather, because that woman did lose her life. That never should have happened. Many who were critical of President Trump, who after Charlottesville claimed there was blame on both sides. But there was no equivalent in the scale of these protest. While antifascist campaigners filled the streets, only around 20 white nationalist turned up in Washington. They had applied for a permit for 20 times that number. Who is the intolerant one?

"Will American pastor Andrew Brunson leave Turkey before 8 September 2018?
",428369,"Washington: The Library of Congress, The Government  of USA has issued the following house proceeding:   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will proceed to executive session and resume consideration of the following nomination, which the clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Michael B. Brennan, of Wisconsin, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Seventh Circuit. Mr. McCONNELL. 

Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Recognition of the Minority Leader The Democratic leader is recognized. Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, later today the Senate will vote on the confirmation of Michael Brennan to the Seventh Circuit over the objections of one of his home-State Senators, Ms. Baldwin, who has not returned a blue slip on his nomination. It is an abject breach of senatorial courtesy that both parties have long respected. In fact, the seat Mr. Brennan will fill on the Seventh Circuit has been held open for 6 years by the senior Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Johnson, via the same process, the blue slip. When Barack Obama was President and when Patrick Leahy was chairman of the Judiciary Committee, we Democrats obeyed the blue slip, and it led that seat to be vacant for 6 years. Now that the shoe is on the other foot, the Republican majority will ignore the blue-slip rights of the Democratic Senator even though it fervently believes that we ought to listen to the rights of the Republican Senator from Wisconsin. The actions of the Republican leader erode one of the few remaining customs in the Senate that forces consultation and consensus on judicial nominations. In the grand scheme of things, the vote may seem to some of my colleagues on the other side like a small one--one judge for one circuit court. But in truth, the vote on Mr. Brennan is a death by a thousand cuts of the grand tradition of bipartisanship and comity in the U.S. Senate. I know all too well that there is plenty of blame to go around on both sides of the aisle, but if we don't take a step back now, the Senate will soon become a rubberstamp or graveyard for Presidential nominees, rendering our advice and consent nearly meaningless. I understand the pressure on the leader from the hard right. They want judges who are not bipartisan. They wanted a judge in this case who did not go through a bipartisan judicial panel, composed of both Democrats and Republicans, who have always sent us judges from Wisconsin. Two were sent, but, instead, Brennan, who couldn't get through the panel, was sent. This is so wrong. This goes beyond what we have seen done before. When Leader McConnell changed the rules on the Supreme Court--which we didn't--many on the other side, I understand, said: Well, that is tit for tat because Democrats changed the rules on the lower courts. But the blue-slip tradition has always been obeyed. We didn't change that. We could have. We could have stuffed through our nominees with no Republican support, but we didn't. I hope for the sake of comity that one or two of my Republican colleagues will stand up and vote against Mr. Brennan's nomination, not because of his beliefs--which they may agree with, for all I know--but for the sake of the Senate, for the grand tradition of the Senate, for the right afforded to every Senator to consult on judges from their State, minority or majority, and most of all, for the traditions that have held this body together for more than two centuries and separated it from the more partisan Chamber on the other end of the Capitol. Release of American Hostages in North Korea Madam President, on another matter--North Korea--early this morning, the three American hostages who were being held in North Korea were returned home. It was great to see them come home, back in America, back with their families. [[Page S2601]] It is a wonderful thing, but the exultation by the President and others of the greatness of North Korea doing this evades me. We can't be fooled into giving the North Korean regime credit for returning Americans who never should have been detained in the first place. American citizens are not diplomatic bargaining chips. While we celebrate the return of the three Americans, for the sake of their freedom and their families, we should not feel as if we need to give Kim Jong Un anything in return. It is troubling to hear President Trump say that Kim Jong Un treated the Americans excellently. Kim Jong Un is a dictator. He capriciously detained American citizens, robbed them of their freedom, and didn't let them go home to their families. Their release should not be exalted; it should be expected. It is no great accomplishment of Kim Jong Un to do this. When the President does this, he weakens American foreign policy and puts Americans at risk around the world. If our adversaries look at what the President has said in reaction to Kim Jong Un, why shouldn't they detain American citizens and get a huge pat on the back when they release them? It is like so many of the President's foreign policy actions--quick, not thought through, related to show and to ego. If our adversaries from Iran to China who already wrongfully hold Americans think they can get something--praise, standing, diplomatic concessions--by unlawfully detaining Americans in their country, you can bet they will try. These are bad people, the leaders of these dictatorships like Iran. So I caution the administration. We are all rooting for diplomacy to succeed on the Korean Peninsula, but we cannot sacrifice the safety of American citizens around the world in exchange for an illusory veneer of peace. I worry that this President, in his eagerness to get acclaim and a photo op, will strike a quick and bad deal, not a strong and lasting one. President Trump and Secretary Pompeo must seek strong, verifiable, enduring commitments from North Korea to disarm. Nuclear Deal with Iran Madam President, now on oil prices and Iran, earlier this week the President exited the Iran deal. We all know that. Even as someone who opposed the deal--which I did because I thought it was flawed; I thought President Obama and Secretary Kerry should have waited longer and given more time for the sanctions to bite, and we would have gotten a stronger and better deal. I still believe that. But once the deal is in place, it seems to me that we should not be focused on undoing this deal. We don't want a nuclear Iran. That is one of the reasons I opposed the deal. But there is no report from anybody, including our own intelligence, that Iran is violating that part of the deal. In the meantime, Iran is doing some very bad things. It is not a country we should admire or respect in any way--the leadership, anyway. They are trying to develop an ICBM. They are creating havoc with the Houthis in Yemen. Worst of all, in my opinion, the greatest immediate danger is that there are Iranian Revolutionary Guard troops in Syria, right near Israel's border, and hundreds, if not thousands, of deadly rockets that Iran gives to Hezbollah, a militant terrorist organization. They placed them in Lebanon where they have hegemony in certain areas. That is the greatest danger to Israel. That is the greatest danger to peace in the Middle East. Down the road, it will be the greatest danger to the United States, at least in the next several years. What we should be doing is not undoing this deal right now but creating new sanctions and telling Iran that if they continue giving missiles to Hezbollah, if they continue sending troops to Iran, if they continue their activities with the Houthis and the placing of additional missiles, we will put on additional sanctions. That is the smartest thing to do, and that is what is most in need now, given America's and the world's security needs. But we need our allies to do it. Sanctions don't work when they are unilateral. We learned that in South Africa years ago with apartheid. Only when the sanctions became broad and enacted by many nations did they have an effect. It is the same situation here. The United States, by pulling out of the agreement and getting our European allies' noses way out of joint, makes it far harder to enact new sanctions on what I perceive to be the greatest dangers we face. There is one other thing Americans should realize about pulling out of the Iran deal, and that is it affects gasoline prices across the country. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, gas prices will rise over the summer, and the average American family can expect to pay $200 more this driving season than last. The Iran deal is certainly some part of that. For middle-class families, $200 this summer is more than the tax break they will get, if they get one at all. When President Trump makes rash decisions without consideration of the consequences and no coherent strategy, which is what has happened with Iran, the American people pay the price in many different ways: security, the declining ability to find and go after the greatest dangers we face with Iran, and money out of our own pocketbooks with an increase in gasoline prices. One of the ways Americans will pay for President Trump's unthought-out decision to exit the Iran deal will be at the gas pump this summer. So again, to repeat, I didn't think the deal was a good deal; still, I am proud I voted no. But at this time, in this place, and for so many reasons, pulling out precipitously without our allies involved does not achieve anything, does not achieve the goals we need to achieve, and hurts Americans in different ways. Prescription Drug Prices Madam President, finally, on prescription drugs, tomorrow the President will give a speech on another important topic in American healthcare: the high cost of prescription drug prices. He is right to give that speech. Americans suffer from the highest prescription drug costs in the developed world. On average, Americans pay over $850 a year on prescription drugs, compared to an average of $400 across 19 other industrialized nations. Remember, that is on average. If you are sick and need one specific new drug on the market for your condition, you could be paying in the tens of thousands of dollars per month for that drug. Sometimes that new drug isn't much different from one already on the market and hasn't been proven to be more effective. Sometimes pharmaceutical companies intentionally corner the market on the drug and raise prices by absurd percentages. We saw that with Mr. Shkreli, and there is no cop on the beat to stop the Shkrelis of the world. It is outrageous, venal, and hurts seniors, the infirm, and regular middle-class families every day. We ought to do something about it. That is why Democrats make lowering the cost of prescription drugs a central pillar of our Better Deal agenda. We propose that there should be greater transparency from companies when they are proposing to increase the prices of their drugs. We propose allowing the government to negotiate for lower drug prices and to establish an office that would go after the most egregious companies and actors who are raising prices on drugs for no reason--price-gouging enforcement. If we were in the majority, these policies would be our top priorities. Hopefully, President Trump will get on board. In fact, I agree with a lot of what President Trump has already said on the issue. He said that the drug companies are ``getting away with murder'' and in the State of the Union Address he said: One of my greatest priorities is to reduce the price of prescription drugs. Prices will come down. President Trump's rhetoric focuses on a problem that we have to address, and we hope sincerely that tomorrow he will follow through on that rhetoric with a tough and detailed plan to achieve what we both wish to achieve. But so far, President Trump has taken little action to downgrade the price of prescription drugs. He installed a former top executive of a pharmaceutical company, Alex Azar, to be the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Now, 6 months before the election, without consulting Democrats or Republicans on the Hill, he will give a speech tomorrow on his plan to bring down the cost of prescription drugs. We welcome the newfound attention. We sincerely hope the President outlines a clear, strong plan in detail [[Page S2602]] about how to tackle this incredible problem. Another ``all hat and no cattle'' speech will not get the job done. More rhetoric, more half measures will not move the needle. We need to do something bold and effective to bring down the outrageous cost of prescription drugs, and we Democrats have a good, strong proposal. We hope he will embrace it. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, let me just say, as a personal matter, this is the first time I have seen you presiding in the Senate. It is a nice sight, and I welcome you. I am here today to talk about the eroding and perhaps even vanishing tradition that we refer to in the Senate as the blue slip. People don't necessarily know what a blue slip is, but there has been a tradition with respect to U.S. attorneys, local U.S. district judges, U.S. marshals, and the seats on the U.S. circuit courts of appeals that are by tradition associated with a particular State. With respect to all of those nominations, there has been a tradition that they require the approval of the home State Senators. The mechanism for that approval is called a blue slip, and there actually is a blue slip. The tradition in the Senate Judiciary Committee that was very rigorously enforced most recently by Chairman Leahy, when he was chairman, is that a nominee for one of those offices does not get a hearing and cannot proceed without the blue slip of the home State Senators. I commend the ranking member on the Judiciary Committee, Senator Dianne Feinstein, on the great work she has done on the minority report she led that describes the history of the blue slip and the extent to which what we are doing today is a break with that tradition. What provokes this is the nomination of Michael Brennan to proceed without a blue slip having been returned by his home State Senator, Ms. Baldwin. Obviously this signals a disrespect to the local Senators with respect to the office for which they heretofore had a blue slip. It also represents a very significant shift of power in Washington from this body, from this Chamber, to the Oval Office, which is a little bit unusual. Politics come and politics go, but it is rare for a political body like the Senate to willingly and willfully emasculate itself to some degree and transfer all of that power down to the executive branch and to the Oval Office. I think there is a quite significant price to be paid for this choice. Representing Rhode Island, we are on the First Circuit Court of Appeals. There is one seat--we are not a very big State; we have just one seat--on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, more properly, that is denominated as the Rhode Island seat. It is now occupied by a terrific judge, the Honorable Rogeriee Thompson, whom Senator Reed and I had a very significant role in getting appointed to that position. Should she step down, that vacancy would ordinarily be seen as the Rhode Island seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, and we would expect that we would be consulted and that our blue slips would be honored with respect to a nominee the President--whichever President--wished to push through. Without divulging too many confidences, I will say that there was some considerable back-and-forth with the Obama administration in order for Senator Reed and me to get the assurances we needed that judges we approved of would be appointed. What I can't figure out is how the tradition of circuit courts of appeals seats having an affiliation with a particular State survives this decision to stop honoring blue slips for circuit courts of appeals. Every single Senator in this Chamber represents a State that lays claim to a certain seat--or a certain number of seats for the big States--on our circuit courts of appeals, but the only thing that undergirds that is the blue slip. The notion that there is a Rhode Island seat on the First Circuit or a Texas seat on the Fifth Circuit or New York seats on the Second Circuit or California seats on the Ninth Circuit or an Alaska seat on the Ninth Circuit doesn't exist in the Constitution. It doesn't exist in law. It exists by virtue of traditions of the Senate, and the only tool that gives that tradition any teeth at all is the blue slip. So what happens if we, on a categorical basis, decide that circuit court of appeals nominees are no longer subject to the home State blue slip? (Mr. SULLIVAN assumed the Chair.) At that point, there is no method for assuring that there is any home State affiliation for that seat whatsoever. A future President could choose to put a New York judge, a Tennessee judge, or an Alaska judge into the so-called Rhode Island seat on the First Circuit. Contrarily, if a so-called Alaska seat on the Ninth Circuit opened up, a future President could put a Rhode Islander into that seat because the only mechanism preventing that from happening is the fact that we honor each other's blue slip. That is the only mechanism that protects this long tradition that the seats on the U.S. circuit courts of appeals are associated with particular home States. So in this mad rush to get circuit judges confirmed--a rush that has completely overwhelmed this body and that has just completely stampeded the tradition of the blue slip--one of the prices that we will pay is that there is no longer any mechanism to enforce that any seat on any circuit court of appeals in this country has any association with any State. I have been joined by my distinguished colleague from Massachusetts on the floor. Massachusetts is a bigger State than Rhode Island. Massachusetts has several seats that the Massachusetts delegation would claim as the Massachusetts seats on the First Circuit if and when an opening should occur in those seats. But with no blue slip, how does that stay a Massachusetts seat? How do we have any voice in this whatsoever if there is no blue slip? We could easily end up in a situation in which all of the circuit courts of appeals have essentially been nationalized. I think there are a great number of lawyers who would more than happily pull up stakes and travel to another location. The distinguished Presiding Officer from Alaska and I have had conversations about the enormous reach of the Ninth Circuit. That already takes quite a lot of traveling. For a lawyer to have the distinction of being able to be a U.S. court of appeals judge--let's say that I have to pull up stakes and move from Texas to Rhode Island--there are plenty of lawyers who would do that. I urge my colleagues--as we undo this blue slip--to think about where this road ends, because a few years from now, if there is a President of a different party and there are circuit court nominees who come up, our Republican colleagues who have supported the abandonment of the blue slip will have no objection and no complaint--no legitimate objection and no legitimate complaint--if seats that are nominally the Alaska seat, the Massachusetts seat, the Rhode Island seat on the circuit get simply given to somebody else. There is no mechanism to prevent that if we don't honor the blue slip. That entire tradition falls right behind the collapse of the blue slip for the circuit courts of appeals. Of course, it is a massive transfer of power from this body to the Oval Office, which is obviously fine with our Republican friends now, given the identity of the person who is in the Oval Office, but that is not forever. Changes like this are forever. So we need to think this through. I will close by saying this. Why is it that we would behave in such a peculiar way with respect to the institution that we love and serve, as to basically disable ourselves with respect to local control over circuit court of appeals nominees and transfer that entire power down to the Oval Office? Why would we do that? That is peculiar behavior. When you look to the heavens and you see peculiar behavior from heavenly bodies, you look for an explanation. One of the reasons we know that dark stars and black holes exist is because they create peculiar behavior [[Page S2603]] in the heavenly bodies around them. What might be the dark star that is causing the peculiar behavior of the Senate in willfully disabling its own power and authority with respect to nominations for circuit courts of appeals? What could explain the otherwise inexplicable dismantling of our own tradition and our own authority in this area? I submit that there is a $17.9 million donation that was brought to bear on the nomination of Judge Garland--the obstruction of that nomination--and the subsequent nomination of Judge Gorsuch from one donor. One anonymous donor put nearly $18 million into an effort to manipulate that process. That is not what has gone wrong with the Courts of Appeals, but it is a signal of powerful political interests out there seeking control over judicial nominees. For what other reason would an individual donor anonymously spend nearly $18 million? That is just one donor. There is plenty of anonymous money flowing into operations that seek to get specific types of people into robes. My concern is that it is the power of special interests that is the dark star that is causing the Senate to undergo this deformation of its traditions--this relinquishment of our individual power as Senators and our group power as a branch of government. It is special interest power that is driving this. There are special interests, such as the gun lobby, that would like to be able to go into a court and know that they have a judge who is predisposed in their favor. There are special interests, such as anti-choice groups, that would like to go into court and know that they have a judge who is predisposed in their favor. The actual very dark money forces that are meddling in our politics are desperate to show up in court when the question of dark money is litigated and have a judge who they know is predisposed in their favor. There are business interests that seek to disable, diminish, and hobble courts and juries, and provide people home cooking arbitration alternatives to their constitutional right to go to court and to face a jury of their peers. They are very interested in seeing to it that when they appear in court on those issues, they have a judge who they believe is predisposed in their interests. I cannot think of another reason why the Senate, as an institution, after all this time, would unilaterally disable itself, would unilaterally emasculate itself with respect to the role of the selection of our circuit court of appeals nominees. I think this is a day that we will come to regret because that first step to get Judge Brennan confirmed may seem very attractive and appealing to a great many of my colleagues, but once you have crossed that Rubicon with that first step, there is no path that I can see that protects the right of individual Senators to assert an interest in a specific seat or a number of seats on the circuit courts of appeals. I think we have more or less taken an irrevocable step toward nationalizing the appointments of all circuit court of appeals nominees, and we will look back on this day and say: What fools we were. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts. Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I want to start by thanking my colleague from Rhode Island for both his powerful analysis of the influence of money on the selection of our judicial nominees and also for his point about the blue slip and the implications of what this means for an independent judiciary. He has been a strong voice on this for a long time, and I think his speech on it was extraordinary and something that I hope everyone listens to and pays attention to. We are facing an unprecedented attack on our courts. This week, once again, Senator McConnell has scheduled confirmation votes on a slate of extremist judicial court nominees--nominees who have demonstrated that they are not committed to the principles of equal justice under law. In this administration, Senate Republicans have been working at breakneck speed to jam our courts with pro-corporate, narrowminded elitists who will tilt the scales of justice in favor of the rich and powerful and against everyone else. They are willing to bend and break and change every rule in the book to do it. Their latest strategy is to ignore the blue slip. For over a century, home-State Senators have played a critical role in the judicial confirmation process by using something called a blue slip to determine whether a judicial nomination should move forward. The Senate Judiciary Committee has historically refused to move forward on a nomination without a blue slip from both home-State Senators. In fact, during the Obama administration, Senate Republicans insisted on maintaining that rule, refusing to move forward on any judicial nominee who did not secure blue slips from both home State Senators. They even stretched the rule beyond all reasonable bounds to stop fairminded, mainstream nominees from being confirmed. But now that Donald Trump is in the White House, Republicans have changed their tune. In order to force extremist nominees onto our courts, they are willing to toss the blue slip right out the window. Michael Brennan, President Trump's nominee to serve on the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, is just the latest example. Even though Mr. Brennan did not receive a blue slip from both home-State Senators, Senate Republicans moved forward on his nomination. Perhaps the ultimate irony is that when President Obama nominated another candidate to fill this very same seat, Mr. Brennan penned a strong defense of Senator Johnson's decision to withhold his blue slip. Now that the shoe is on the other foot, those principles have magically disappeared. Let's be clear here. There are plenty of reasons for any Senator to be concerned about Mr. Brennan's fitness to serve on the Federal bench. I will just mention a few. Mr. Brennan has mocked millions of hard-working women who have faced sexism and obstacles to advancement. He has dismissed the idea of a glass ceiling. Mr. Brennan has defended a Wisconsin law that added unnecessary barriers to women who were seeking access to abortion, even in the case of rape or incest. Mr. Brennan supports criminal sentencing policies that slap low-level offenders with long jail sentences and exacerbate the problem of mass incarceration in America. And it gets worse. Mr. Brennan believes that it is A-OK for judges to refuse to follow binding court precedent when the judge just thinks it is incorrect. Now, that is extreme. But Senate Republicans have shown that they just don't care. They are willing to do whatever it takes to hand over our courts to moneyed interests. Nomination of Thomas Farr There are many other radical nominees who are also in line. I want to take some time to talk about one of them, but I think it is important to explain just what is at stake here. In 2015, I was honored to join thousands of marchers to commemorate the anniversary of Bloody Sunday. On that chilly March morning 53 years ago, hundreds of nonviolent voting rights advocates, including many poor and rural African Americans who had been systemically shut out of the political process, joined together to march 54 miles from Selma to Montgomery to demand equal access to their constitutional right to vote. As they crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge, the marchers, including my friend Congressman John Lewis, came face-to-face with a wall of State troopers armed with billy clubs. The troopers had one message for the marchers: Turn back. Don't fight this fight. It is not worth it. Fully aware that they were putting their lives on the line, the protesters decided it was worth it. They held their ground. As the protesters fell to their knees to pray, they were brutally attacked by the State troopers. As television footage and pictures of the brutality that day ricocheted across America, the country was forced to grapple with an ugly truth: In a country that is supposed to be a beacon of democracy, many citizens had systematically been stripped of the fundamental right to vote. The march set in motion the signing of the Voting Rights Act of 1965--a landmark law that banned racially discriminatory voting practices. I wish I could say the fight for voting rights ended that day--the day President [[Page S2604]] Johnson signed that law--but it didn't. Even today, powerful forces combine to strip Americans of their lawful right to vote. States have passed restrictive voter ID laws, purged voting rolls, limited opportunities to register, and erected other barriers to the political process, all with the same goal--to make sure that people who wouldn't vote for them wouldn't get a chance to vote at all. Federal courts have been on the frontlines of that battle. Citizens have sought justice by asking the courts to strike down laws that make it harder for people of color, low-income people, the elderly, disabled, or others to vote. The judges who sit on those courts have one duty--to uphold equal justice under law. The Senate must determine whether Federal judicial nominees are prepared to meet that obligation. Thomas Farr, the nominee for the Eastern District of North Carolina, clearly fails that test. Instead of standing up for the rights of all people to vote, Mr. Farr has been the go-to lawyer for powerful interests who have worked to stop people of color and marginalized groups from exercising their right to vote. Among the most appalling parts of Mr. Farr's resume is his work for Jesse Helms, the former U.S. Senator and shameless bigot. Helms made his views on civil rights and equal treatment clear. He opposed renewal of the Voting Rights Act. He led opposition to commemorate the birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr., as a holiday. He called LGBTQ individuals ``disgusting, weak, and morally sick wretches.'' He supported the apartheid regime in South Africa. Senator Helms led some of the most blatantly racist political campaigns in modern history. For example, to drive down Black turnout, his campaign mailed over 100,000 postcards to homes in predominantly Black neighborhoods threatening that those individuals could be criminally prosecuted if they voted. Helms's most infamous campaign ad was a television spot that showed White hands crumpling up a job application, with an announcer saying that the person needed that job, but it was taken by a minority. These ugly appeals to racism were a core part of Helms's campaign, and Mr. Farr was right by his side, serving as Helms's campaign lawyer. But Mr. Farr's troubling record doesn't end there. In recent years, he has played a central role in resisting anti-discrimination efforts in North Carolina. In 2013, the Supreme Court dismantled a key part of the 1965 Voting Rights Act in its Shelby County v. Holder ruling, making it easier for States to enact discriminatory voter laws. After Shelby County, North Carolina's Republican-led legislature wasted no time in restricting voting rights, searching for ways to make it harder for African Americans in the State to vote. North Carolina legislators requested data about voting practices broken down by race, identified laws that helped African Americans vote, and went about gutting each one of them. In just 3 legislative days, the State legislature rammed through an omnibus voter suppression bill. The bill included a voter ID provision that specifically excluded IDs that African Americans disproportionately used. It eliminated the first week of early voting. It ended same-day registration. It eliminated out-of-precinct voting. It stopped preregistration for 16- and 17-years-olds. These were all--every one of them--practices that helped boost African-American voter turnout. The bill was challenged in court by faith groups, by civil rights groups, and by the U.S. Government. Where was Thomas Farr? Where was he? He was on the other side, defending the discriminatory law. The Federal appeals court rejected Mr. Farr's argument. It concluded that the North Carolina Legislature had intentionally discriminated in passing its voting laws, targeting African Americans with ``surgical precision.'' That case represents just one of many times Mr. Farr has defended powerful interests who discriminate against and harass those who are less powerful. I will mention a few more. When North Carolina redrew its district lines in a way that diluted the votes of African Americans, Mr. Farr defended it. When Avis, a car rental company, was sued for discriminating against African-American customers, Mr. Farr was there once again defending discrimination. Time after time, Mr. Farr has defended racial discrimination. He has also defended discrimination against workers, discrimination against women, and discrimination against LGBTQ individuals. For example, Mr. Farr defended an employer who created a toxic work environment for female employees, instructing them to wear skirts to attract clients, commenting that women belonged in the home instead of the workplace, and telling one woman that he would help her pick up her panties from the floor. He defended the discriminatory North Carolina law that prevents transgender men and women from using the bathrooms that reflect their gender identity. Anyone paying attention to judicial nominations knows that powerful interests are working to capture our courts. They have been having a field day in this administration. I have come before this Chamber on many occasions to oppose radical, pro-corporate nominees handpicked by those powerful interests. Thomas Farr is one of those radical, pro- corporate nominees. He is one of them, but he has set himself apart even from the many terrible nominees the Trump administration has forced through the Senate because Mr. Farr has directly worked to dismantle one of the most precious and fundamental rights of our democracy--the right to vote. In a State that is over one-fifth African American, the Eastern District of North Carolina has never had an African-American Federal district judge--not a single one. The Senate held up two thoroughly qualified African-American women for this same seat--two women who would have sailed through the Senate if they had gotten a vote, but they were held up so that a Republican President could fill the vacancy. And now President Trump has nominated someone who has spent much of his career defending discrimination against African Americans. Talk about rubbing salt in the wound. Equal justice under the law is a cornerstone of American democracy, but that promise cannot be fully realized if we allow individuals like Mr. Farr to secure lifetime positions on our courts. Someone who thinks that States should be able to make it harder for Americans to vote based on the color of their skin or the likelihood that they will vote for a particular political party should be automatically disqualified from a Federal judgeship. I urge my colleagues to vote no on Mr. Farr's nomination. The integrity of our courts is at stake. Thank you. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona. Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 1551 Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I rise today to fulfill a promise to continue to advocate for a solution that will address the critical issues of securing the border and protecting young immigrants impacted by an uncertain future--those who are part of the DACA Program. Last month, I again offered legislation to extend the DACA Program for 3 years and to provide 3 years of increased funding for border security--a so-called 3-for-3 program. I think this is a way we can reach a compromise on this issue that will do two important things-- one, provide much needed funding to secure the border. Being from a border State like Arizona, I can certainly understand that. We need a more secure border. We need additional resources, including barriers, technology, and manpower, and this legislation would provide that. At the same time, it would provide protection for those kids--numbering about 800,000 and many more eligible as well--who face an uncertain future because we haven't been able to extend or to make permanent this program. By the way, these are kids who were brought across the border through no fault of their own when their average median age, I think, was about 6 years old. It is not their fault that they were brought here this way. For all intents and purposes, they are American--everything without the papers. Many of them have now graduated from college and face an uncertain future in the job market. Many of them are in school looking to continue that education. Many of them serve in our military. We have to do right by them and do what is good for the country, as well, and I think this legislation would do that. [[Page S2605]] Unfortunately, some of my colleagues have repeatedly chosen to block the measure. I am the first to admit that this solution is far from perfect. We need to do a lot of other things with immigration reform. We need to address long-term labor needs, as well as a more permanent solution for those who are here illegally who weren't brought across the border as children. But this is a compromise that can pass. Given the action over the last couple of days in the House, where there was a group of House Members--Republicans and Democrats--looking to force that body to finally take action on this, it is again time to have the Senate make another attempt. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 300, H.R. 1551. I further ask that the Flake substitute amendment at the desk be considered agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be considered read a third time and passed; and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Utah. Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina. Calling for the Release of Pastor Andrew Brunson Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, a couple of weeks ago, I started the first of what will be a weekly speech to bring attention to what I think is a travesty of justice occurring in Turkey. I wish to speak about a pastor, a Presbyterian minister from North Carolina, who has lived in Turkey for about 20 years and who has done his very best to respect the laws of Turkey and to bring the Word to people who want to hear it. Unfortunately, he has been swept up in a coup. He has been swept up in the emergency powers of Turkey. He has been in prison for 580 days. I went to Turkey about 6 weeks ago to visit Pastor Brunson in prison because I heard that after being in prison for about a year and a half--and for much of that time in a cell that is designed for 8 people and had 21 people in it--he was then indicted. I heard he was afraid the American people were going to read that 62-page bogus indictment, with some of the flimsiest charges we could imagine--charges that wouldn't keep someone overnight in an American jail--that have kept him in prison for 580 days. About 2 months ago, he was indicted, but he said to his wife and friends, he was afraid the American people would read that indictment and turn their backs on him. So it was important for me to travel over there and tell him face-to- face in that Turkish prison that is the last thing that is going to happen. We are going to continue to work every day he is in prison. I am going to come to the Senate floor, and other Members are, every week for as long as he is illegally in prison, and we are going to make sure the American people and the Turkish people know what is going on and send a very clear message to the leaders of Turkey that this is an unacceptable way to deal with a NATO ally. It is a horrible way to deal with somebody who is only guilty of standing up for a church in Izmir. It is a small church. Actually, the seating area down below, maybe if it was packed, could hold 150 people. It opens up to a street. It is in a residential area. They let anybody come in. They open their windows. They actually talk with the police about security matters so they know what is going on, but it is just a small church, and all he was trying to do is provide aid and comfort for those who want to seek it. Every once in a while, he would go to Syria or other parts of Turkey to try to provide aid and comfort to those who need it, Syrian refugees or anyone else. Part of the charges are actually related to that. If you provide aid and comfort, food, to a Kurdish person, in Turkey today, you may be considered a terrorist or a coup plotter. That is what he has been charged with. In my second trip, I spent 12 hours in a Turkish courtroom to hear every word of the testimony from secret witnesses--whom Pastor Brunson didn't get to face--about the horrible things he did. One of the charges was that one night a witness saw for 4 hours a light on in one of the rooms in the church. Here is the problem with that charge: That is the room. It doesn't have a window. So unless they had x-ray vision, there is no possible way they could have observed that, but it became weighty testimony in the courtroom. It is a kangaroo court. I want to continue to say, if you don't know ``kangaroo court,'' there is the definition. It is just a trumped-up theater that bears no resemblance to anything you would ever see in American jurisprudence. Let me give another idea of the level of absurdity of the charges. Pastor Brunson's daughter posted how much she enjoyed a meal with friends. It turns out the prosecutor thought this particular meal was something that was enjoyed by people who participated in the Gulen movement, and therefore her father must somehow be associated with the coup attempt. These are actually serious discussions going on in a Turkish courtroom. I wasn't able to make it back to Turkey on Monday. I understand that basically the same thing happened, but it got worse. On Monday, when Pastor Brunson and his defense attorney had asked that 10 other witnesses testify on his behalf, they weren't allowed to testify because they were suspects. They weren't convicted. They apparently have been charged or considered to be charged, but in Turkish jurisprudence standards, to be suspect is enough to prevent you from actually helping defend someone who is on trial for a 35-year sentence. He has been in prison for 580 days. He has lost 50 pounds. He is struggling to keep his wits about him, and he and his wife are doing an extraordinary job. This is a miscarriage of justice. I believe, today, as I said in a speech 2 weeks ago, and I will say it again: Don't travel to Turkey right now. If you are thinking about making a trip to Turkey, make sure you don't eat this meal--and, for goodness' sake, if you do, don't post how much you enjoyed it because you may be considered a Gulenist. Don't take a picture with friendly people on the street whose ethnic origins you don't know because they may have you associated with somebody who is suspected of plotting a coup. That is the reality of Turkey today. I can't guarantee the safety of North Carolinians because I have yet to actually speak with people in their state department and their foreign ministry who actually understand the absurdity of what is going on in Turkey today. I hope we can get back to a better position, but until this man is released, and others who have been falsely charged are treated fairly, I am going to have to come to the Senate floor each and every week we are in session to make sure the American people know what is going on in Turkey and to make absolutely certain that people like Pastor Brunson who are in prison know they have people in the U.S. Senate. In fact, 66 Senate Members have signed a letter--that is a big lift in the U.S. Senate to get any 66 Members to agree on something--to send a very clear message that we are watching, and there will be consequences if this man is wrongfully imprisoned and could potentially spend the rest of his life in Turkey. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to enter into a colloquy with my friend and colleague from Oklahoma. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, with that approval, I will pass it over and thank Senator Lankford for his hard work--he has been aware of this issue from day one--and collaboration on it. Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I thank Senator Tillis and the Presiding Officer for acknowledging our time to have this conversation. This is a serious conversation because this is a NATO ally. Dr. Andrew Brunson has been in Turkey 24 years. For 23 of these years, he served as a pastor in humanitarian work. He took care of providing food and clothing and pastoral ministry for anyone who would come, just like anyone does. That has not been an issue in Turkey for decades because Turkey has been very open to all faiths, all religions, and they have prided themselves on [[Page S2606]] being a nation that recognizes all faiths, all backgrounds, and all religions and ethnicity. At least that was the old Turkey. Literally, under Dr. Brunson's feet, Turkey shifted from where they were to where we don't recognize them anymore as a NATO ally. In October of 2016, Dr. Brunson was called by the police department there. Assuming it was an immigration issue, he and his wife went because they had gone multiple times to the police department to renew their visa and keep everything up to date. They had a great relationship with the local police department, with local individuals, and with all the authorities in the area because they had been there for two decades and had developed great friendships. So they went to check in, but this time, instead just checking in again for an immigration issue, they took them into custody, without any charges, and held them for a year--with no charges--then, eventually, presented these trumped-up charges which they have laid out that are absolutely absurd. How a Christian minister is somehow cooperating with a Muslim in a coup in Turkey is absurd on its face. All of the crazy accusations from secret witnesses who would appear by video with their faces blurred out, making accusations that they had seen or they had heard--allowing no one to actually ask them questions is absurd. Just as absurd is not allowing Dr. Brunson to bring any witnesses in his defense. There have now been two hearings that have been just this style: Dr. Brunson not allowed to bring anyone to speak on his behalf; all of these trumped-up witnesses who come with blurred-out faces--this secret testimony that they can present--to come back and present something they would consider evidence that we would never allow in any court, and, quite frankly, no one would take seriously these accusations. In 2016, after Dr. Brunson had been in jail for a few weeks, I went to Turkey and visited with the Minister of Justice there. The Minister of Justice at that time said: We have some information. We are going to work this out. We are going to allow the process to go through the court system, but we will rapidly go through this process. Now, a year and a half later, we are finding out there never was any evidence, there never was any issue--and we are still dealing with an American being held hostage by a NATO ally. I thought I would never say this sentence, but I would like to see Turkey follow the example of North Korea and release the American hostages they are holding. Now, when Turkey--a NATO ally--is behind North Korea in how they are handling humanitarian issues, Turkey has moved to a very bad spot. It is not a place they need to stay. Turkey has been a friend and an ally--we work together against terrorism; we work together on economics--but I join Senator Tillis in the statement he just made: I discourage anyone I speak to, to do any business in Turkey or to travel to Turkey at this point. If you are doing business in Turkey, you cannot guarantee the safety of your employees any longer; if you are traveling to Turkey, you cannot be guaranteed safety anymore. Because of the emergency powers that are currently being used in their legal system, they can sweep up anyone for any accusation and hold them for any length of time. That is not just theory; that is being proven by a pastor being held for a year and a half in Turkey with false charges. I highly recommend no one does business in Turkey at this moment, just for the safety of your employees and the people you would work with. Now, Turkey has not just done this. They have also turned toward Russia, pursuing Russia for their air defense systems. As a NATO ally, that is unheard of, to say they are going to have NATO equipment, but then they are also going to go to Russia. That shows the turning of President Erdogan and the leadership of the country. Congress is not going to just sit back on this and should not. Senator Shaheen and I have already put language out for the foreign ops bill in Appropriations which would specifically identify those individuals--the judges in the court, the officials who are holding Pastor Brunson, the officials in the city jail and in their national government who are specifically holding those individuals--to apply sanctions directly to the individuals who are holding an American pastor hostage. Senator Shaheen, Senator Tillis, and I have already put forward a piece of legislation blocking Turkey from maintaining or purchasing the F-35. They are a NATO ally, and they should have access to that, but they are not acting like a NATO ally. We don't know where they are going, and it would be a mistake for the United States to give our best technology--somewhere that we don't know where it is going to go and how it is going to be used in the future. Just this week, the House released their National Defense Authorization Act. In the base text of the NDAA coming from the House is a provision which would block all defense sales to Turkey until we get more information about what is happening in the future and what direction Turkey is going. That is a reasonable precaution to take in a nation that is rapidly shifting away from democracy, a free court, free speech, and freedom of religion. They are losing humanitarian values. We should address that and respond to that, and we are. It is not just what we might do; it is what we are doing currently to try to respond to this issue. The State Department continues to apply diplomatic pressure, but we have moved past the time when diplomatic pressure needs to be applied. It is time to apply economic pressure and pressure on how our partnership will work long term. We want our ally back--the Turkey we used to know, that we cooperated with, and maintained a long-term friendship with. We would love to maintain that long-term friendship with an ally that has strongly stood with us, and we have stood with them, but we do not recognize what Turkey is anymore. A good first step with them would be to follow the lead of North Korea and release our hostages out of their jails. Mr. President, I yield back. Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Lankford. I went to Turkey when I was speaker of the house in North Carolina and led a delegation there about 7 years ago, spent 9 days, met with business leaders, and met with President Erdogan. I came away with a great deal of optimism--as a matter of fact, so much optimism, I hosted a delegation from the mayor of Kayseri, who is now a Minister in the Turkish Government, to talk about how North Carolina and Turkey could build stronger economic ties. We both have textile and furniture industries. It looked like a great opportunity, but, as Senator Lankford said, the Turkey of today bears no resemblance to the Turkey I visited about 7 years ago, to the Turkey I visited just a few weeks ago. I would like to be talking about how we help Turkey take the fight to terrorist organizations threatening their homeland. I would like to work more with Turkey, as we have this week, to identify ISIS leaders, detain them, and make that region safer. I would like to be a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee-- and sit right next to Senator Sullivan--fighting for additional NDAA provisions that underscore our commitment to our NATO ally in Turkey, but now I am at a fork in the road, and right now I only have one position to take; that is, to put Turkey on notice for their bad actions as a NATO ally and for their bad actions toward American nationals in the country of Turkey. So I am with Senator Lankford, Senator Shaheen, and other Senators. When we do our markup on the national defense authorization, instead of talking about how we strengthen our relationship for their part in manufacturing the Joint Strike Fighter and what is the timeline to actually have our NATO ally have Joint Strike Fighters, F-35s, within their military base, now I have to start talking about whether they should have it at all. I have to start talking about what are the implications of a Russian missile defense system in a NATO country, with all the intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance assets that come with it. I have to start talking about what the future of our relationship is with a nation that is, for the first time in NATO history, holding American hostages--a NATO ally. I have to take [[Page S2607]] things in a different direction. It is my responsibility, as the co- lead of the Senate NATO observer group, as the Senator of a State who has had a citizen in prison for 580 days. I have no choice.

On Friday, the Turkish lira suffered its biggest one-day devaluation in nearly two decades, dropping more than 14 percent against the dollar. The minister of finance - the son-in-law of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan - couldn't avert the slide, delivering a halting speech that did little to boost confidence.

But Erdogan, as he so often does, placed the blame on a foreign scapegoat: the United States.

""Shame on you, shame on you,"" he declared at a rally. ""You are swapping your strategic partner in NATO for a pastor.""

The pastor in question is Andrew Brunson, an American clergyman who has been in Turkish custody since 2016. He is charged with espionage and other crimes - charges that he and U.S. officials reject. Attempts to win his freedom have so far failed.

             According to my colleagues, Ankara hoped to swap Brunson for Hakan Atilla, a banker convicted in the United States for his role in a scheme that skirted U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil. But the Trump administration resents Turkey's use of Brunson as a political hostage. A high-level meeting in Washington last week with a visiting Turkish delegation ended abruptly after the Americans demanded the pastor's immediate release.

President Trump then announced increased tariffs on Turkish aluminum and steel, which sent the value of the lira plummeting to a historic low. Turkey's economic woes are of its own making, but the tariffs made things worse - and Trump was only too happy to take credit.

Erdogan continued his complaints in a New York Times op-ed, railing against ""unilateral actions against Turkey by the United States, our ally of decades."" He recited the familiar catalog of affronts, including Washington's unwillingness to hand over Fethullah Gulen, a Muslim cleric accused of fomenting a failed 2016 coup against Erdogan, and continued American support for Syrian Kurdish factions. He then delivered a clear threat, urging Washington to ""give up the misguided notion that our relationship can be asymmetrical and come to terms with the fact that Turkey has alternatives.""

If the United States won't change its approach, Erdogan warned, Turkey will ""start looking for new friends and allies."" Indeed, the Turkish president has beefed up ties with Russia, attempted to mend fences with key Western European governments and, as a significant importer of Iranian oil, could undermine American efforts to isolate Tehran.

             But this posturing will win him even more enemies in Washington, where Erdogan is already a deeply unpopular figure. Congress has passed legislation making a critical sale of F-35 jets to Turkey contingent upon terms that include Brunson's immediate release. Erdogan critics in U.S. foreign policy circles loathe his creeping authoritarianism. And Trump, unlike previous presidents, has shown an endless willingness to bully erstwhile allies whenever he disagrees with them.

""Washington has generally tried to calm global markets in such moments, especially when investors are gripped by fear of contagion,"" noted the Wall Street Journal. ""Trump instead squeezed Ankara further."" This had global ramifications: Turkey's wobbles stoked wider fears of fragility in other emerging markets and raised alarms among some major European banks that hold Turkish debt.

In an interview with Bloomberg News, Aaron Stein, a Middle East expert at the Atlantic Council, suggested that Erdogan had badly miscalculated the situation. ""The power balance is asymmetric, totally in the U.S. favor,"" Stein said. ""There are no guard rails to escalation on the U.S. side, and that's where the Turks have completely, completely messed up in their understanding of what's going on in the U.S.""

Erdogan's appeals to NATO partnership ring especially hollow, given both Erdogan's testy relations with Europe and Trump's carping about the alliance. ""For an administration or a president that doesn't give much value to NATO, the value of Turkey as a staunch NATO ally also has declined,"" Jacob Funk Kirkegaard of the Peterson Institute for International Economics told Bloomberg News. ""The Trump administration isn't going to walk an extra mile to save an organization it doesn't value.""

             Analysts hope cooler heads prevail. ""Turkey's economic and legal problems are obvious, but sanctions by the U. S. are unlikely to help anything,"" observed Turkish commentator Mustafa Akyol. ""Rather they may be counterproductive, boosting Turkey's nationalist mood and pushing the country further towards the Russian axis. More diplomacy is needed, not sanctions.""

But productive diplomacy is in short supply. Much of Erdogan's politics now hinge on stirring nationalist sentiment to justify his tightening grip on the country. He won re-election in June with the backing of ultra-nationalists, arguing that greater control would help him steer Turkey's flagging economy out of trouble. Instead, things have only gotten worse.

""The current crisis is the culmination of Erdogan's reckless stewardship. Fixing it will take years - a task that will require new leadership and an entirely different mentality,"" wrote Aykan Erdemir, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington and an Erdogan critic.

Nevertheless, even as Turkey suffers, Erdogan may not take much of a political hit. ""Turkey's toothless opposition ... fails to provide much hope,"" Erdemir noted. ""Without strong political forces to push him out, Erdogan will almost certainly continue to dig himself and the Turkish economy into a deeper hole.""

Trump also may gain more by refusing to compromise. He may relish the chance to act tough and appeal to his core supporters by squeezing a prominent Muslim leader over the fate of an American pastor.

""Backing Brunson plays to the American president's base - all the more conspicuously so given that NASA scientist Serkan Golge, a dual Turkish-U.S. citizen, is also being held in Turkey, serving out a seven-and-a-half-year sentence for charges similar to those being brought against Brunson,"" wrote Elmira Bayrasli, a professor of international affairs at Bard College.

Of course, she noted, there's a key difference: ""Golge is Muslim, unlike Brunson, whom Trump has called 'a great Christian' and 'innocent man of faith.' The Trump administration has said nothing about Golge's detention.""

"Will American pastor Andrew Brunson leave Turkey before 8 September 2018?
",965912,"The financial crisis a decade ago struck at the very heart of the global economy - the strategically important banks in the United States and Europe. But it took time to arrive. The ""big one"" of 2008 followed a series of mini-crises elsewhere in the world.

Over a 15-year period, problems in the emerging markets worked their way to the heart of the international system. Mexico, Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea, Brazil, Russia and Argentina were all warning signs that unchaining global finance would eventually prove costly to the rich developed countries as well. Unfortunately, the warning signs were ignored.

That's why Turkey matters. The recovery from the recession 10 years ago has been patchy. Trade tensions have been rising. Reform of the financial system has been incomplete. For the time being, Turkey looks like a localised crisis with no significant spillover effects. It has the potential to be more serious than that.

For a start, it is a relatively big country, with a population of 80 million and an economy four times as big as neighbouring Greece. Turkey's geopolitical significance extends beyond the fact that it straddles Europe and Asia. As a member of Nato, it has traditionally been seen as part of the west's defence against Russian expansionism. It is also currently the home to 3 million Syrian refugees, many of whom would like to be living in the European Union.

What's more, its problems - while acute - are not unique. Many emerging market economies borrowed heavily in dollars when American interest rates were at rock-bottom levels. The result was credit-driven growth, which starts to look fragile when - as now - the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates and the dollar is strengthening.

Turkey, though, is in a class of its own. An economic and financial crisis that has been brewing all year has finally come to a head. Inflation has hit 15% and will inevitably be pushed higher because the lira is in free fall, dropping 14% on Friday alone. As Capital Economics have noted, when the rouble fell by a similar amount in 2014, the Russian central bank responded by raising interest rates by 6.5 percentage points and announced measures to support the banking system.

Russia had learnt lessons from its previous crisis, not least the need for ample foreign currency reserves to help defend the exchange rate. Turkey does not have deep pockets and has a president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has decided that the conventional response to a plunging currency - higher interest rates - is not for him.

Erdogan is one of the world's current crop of self-styled strongmen leaders but has the misfortune to come up against someone who is a lot stronger than he is. Relations between Turkey and the US are not good. The White House is unhappy that Erdogan has put in an order with Vladimir Putin to buy Russian rather than American missiles. When Donald Trump announced economic sanctions against Iran last week, Erdogan pointedly refused to take part. And, so far, Turkey has refused to release an American pastor, Andrew Brunson, held on disputed terrorism charges.

Trump chose his moment well. On Friday, when Turkey was in chaos, he announced that he was doubling tariffs on imported steel and aluminium, vital to the Turkish economy. Talk about kicking someone when they are down.

Erdogan has insisted that he will not be browbeaten into submission but has few realistic options. To be sure, Turkey can seek to put pressure on Trump by saying that it will quit Nato and forge closer ties with Russia. Erdogan could warn the EU that it will face a new inflow of migrants unless it intervenes on his behalf.

But what the financial markets are looking for are not diplomatic moves that demonstrate Turkey's geopolitical importance but rather economic measures to prevent a potentially ruinous tsunami of selling over the coming days. In that respect, failure to tackle the signs of trouble earlier will now prove costly.

Erdogan's answer to the financial crisis - that his followers should do their patriotic duty and exchange rapidly appreciating US dollars for ever-more worthless Turkish lira - is laughable. Indeed, it will merely add to the belief in the world's financial markets that Turkey is being led by a man who has lost touch with reality.

It is clear what needs to happen. Turkey has to tackle the three causes of its current predicament: an overheating economy; Erdogan's attempts since his re-election in June to prevent the central bank from taking the necessary action to deal with rising prices; and the stand-off with the US.

For Erdogan, that means eating a huge plateful of humble pie. He is going to have to surrender to Trump over Brunson, because he is damaging the economy by continuing with a fight he cannot win. And he will need to accept that tough and unpopular measures are now inevitable to prevent a total collapse in the currency leading to hyper-inflation.

Interest rates are already at 17.75%, but with inflation poised to go to 20% over the coming months, are nowhere near high enough to put a floor under the lira.

Judging by his actions so far, Erdogan's next move will be to impose capital controls. However, as Paul Greer of Fidelity International notes, Turkey is a relatively open economy and requires a large amount of finance from overseas. Capital controls would not work on their own and would need to be supplemented by a rescue package from the International Monetary Fund.

It's either that, though, or a display of shock and awe from the central bank. Turkey is running out of options and running out of time. And that should be a concern for all of us.",30,"And, so far, Turkey has refused to release an American pastor, Andrew Brunson, held on disputed terrorism charges.

(1) Underlying profit is calculated as profit excluding profit (or loss) on sale of fixed assets, acquisition related amortisation and external transaction costs. On 18 April 2018, the Group released a trading update confirming that trading in the first quarter was significantly ahead of the Board's expectations. As a consequence, the Group confirmed that it believed results for the full year would be ahead of market expectations at that time. The Group has seen full year market expectations increase as a result of that announcement. Operating profit in the period was driven by a number of factors. Funeral mix and average income In the trading update provided on 19 January 2018, the Group estimated that as a result of the changes to service and pricing, the mix of funerals would change. As subsequently reported, a step change in simple funerals conducted has occurred, as expected, albeit at a lower level than originally anticipated.FY 2017    FY 2017      FY 2018(*)      FY 2018(*)    Q1 2018    Q1 2018 Board's         Board's Actual     Actual    expectations    expectations     Actual     Actual Funeral          Average     Volume         Average          Volume    Average     Volume type              (GBP)    Mix (%)           (GBP)         Mix (%)      (GBP)    Mix (%) --------------  ---------  ---------  --------------  --------------  ---------  --------- Full service       3,800         60           3,800              44      3,875         55 Simple service           2,700          7           1,965              20      2,100         12 Pre-need           1,650         27           1,650              30      1,680         28 Other                500          6             500               6        580          5Weighted average           2,945                      2,590                      2,883 Ancillary revenue             277                        280                        212 --------------  ---------  ---------  --------------  --------------  ---------  --------- Average revenue           3,222                      2,870                      3,095 --------------  ---------  ---------  --------------  --------------  ---------  ---------* As per January 2018 trading update. The mix in the first quarter was impacted by the changes to pricing not taking place until mid January and the run rate of 15 per cent simple service funerals took approximately two weeks to establish. As such, the first quarter effectively includes one month of the former mix. Consequently, it is likely that the average mix of full service funerals for the remainder of the year will be lower than that seen in the first quarter. This will also be impacted by the ongoing trials, described in more detail below. Death rate The absolute number of deaths increased by approximately eight percent to 181,000 from 167,000 in the comparative period last year. Historical data indicates that it is likely that this proportional increase will not continue throughout the remainder of the year. However, the Group believes that it is now likely that the full year will record at least the same number of deaths as last year (590,000). Market share The Group performed 21,400 funerals compared to 20,100 in the same period last year, representing a market share of 11.8 per cent and 12.0 per cent respectively. This performance was consistent with the Board's expectations. It is too early to conclude if the service and price changes are slowing the rate of market share decline. Operating performance since the end of March continues to be strong. Whilst too early to be certain, strong market share data in March and April is potentially showing the first signs of incremental benefits from the Group's strategic changes. Directors' remuneration As previously announced, the current Executive Directors waived their entitlement to any annual bonus in respect of 2017's financial performance. As this decision was made in 2018, the bonus accrual made in 2017 was released in the first quarter of 2018 and amounted to approximately GBP1.7 million (including employer's national insurance). This is therefore reflected in the GBP37.5 million underlying operating profit reported. Ongoing strategic work Trials At the beginning of April 2018, the Group launched further price and service trials across the country. Two changes (to service offering and price) are being tested in these trials. Firstly, the Group is trialling a new Limited Service Package. This provides clients at a fixed price of GBP2,595 plus disbursements, the service available with the Simple Funeral, but with the additional ability to add one or two limousines at an additional cost; a better quality coffin; and certain other services not included in the simple service package. The Group's Simple Funeral remains at the new lower prices of GBP1,995 (plus disbursements) in England and Wales and GBP1,695 (plus disbursements) in Scotland. The Group does not plan to test a lower Simple Funeral price assuming no further material changes to market pricing. The Group is also testing price reductions to its full service offering so that the starting price for a traditional service excluding any limousines is no more than GBP3,395 plus disbursements. The trials being conducted are material. In broad terms, one quarter of the Group's portfolio has not had any changes applied; a similar proportion has introduced the Limited Service Funeral package; another quarter has just implemented reductions to full service prices; and the remaining quarter has implemented the new funeral package and reduced prices. Depending on the results, the Group anticipates tests continuing on this basis at least until the end of June 2018. Data in April indicates that the trials are generating an average in overall terms approximately GBP120 less than that seen overall in the first quarter, although it is too early to conclude on whether there is any incremental volume benefit. Work on operating model As outlined in March 2018, the Group has engaged L.E.K. Consulting to work with us in developing our plan for the funeral business. Work is progressing well and the Group will be in a position to report the findings of the funeral operating model review and timetable for implementation of conclusions alongside the Group's interim results on 1 August 2018. Digital and promotional work The Group has started investing further in pay per click advertising to understand the economic benefit that can be derived. In addition, the Group has made technological advances in dealing with enquiries from potential clients in a more efficient and professional way. Whilst already live across the business, formal training at all locations will be completed by the end of June 2018. The Group also launched in April 2018 an attended direct cremation under its Simplicity Cremations brand. This allows a limited number of people to attend a short committal service at a time and date of the Group's choosing for an additional GBP250. The Group's direct cremation services are only available online. Other matters All other divisions are operating in line with the Board's expectations as at January 2018. The crematoria division performed 19,100 cremations (Q1 2017: 18,500), representing 10.6 per cent (Q1 2017: 11.0 per cent) of all deaths. There can be a period of up to four weeks between death and the funeral service. Consequently, market share calculations over a short period such as the first quarter can be misleading. During the period, Standard & Poor's lowered the rating of the Group's Secured B Notes to BB from BBB. This has no impact on the financial covenant or any other obligation of the Secured Notes from a Group perspective. Given the duration of the Secured Notes, this structure is capable of being used to periodically issue further Secured Notes when deemed appropriate and subject to market conditions. Given the recent trading updates, the Group does not have any plans for such an issue in the immediate future. Such an issue would also require the rating of the Secured B Notes by Standard & Poor's to be at least BBB. Acquisition activity in the period has continued, with the Group completing the acquisition of one funeral location for a consideration of approximately GBP3.8 million. Further acquisition activity is expected throughout the year. In addition, the Group has opened three satellite locations in the period. Construction of the Group's new crematorium in Derbyshire is complete and the location will begin operating in the second quarter of 2018. This will bring the Group's crematoria portfolio to 46, with two further locations under construction and due to open in 2019. There have been no other significant transactions since the period end date.",59,"Whilst too early to be certain, strong market share data in March and April is potentially showing the first signs of incremental benefits from the Group's strategic changes.",0.6139395236968994,5.002703666687012,1

",90492,"Google is rolling out Android Pie, the latest version of its operating system, to phones across the globe - starting with its own Pixel devices.

While Google officially started the rollout Monday, most won't see their phones update this week. The company started pushing updates to its phones, as well as to select models from smartphone makers including Sony, Essential, Xiaomi and Vivo. Google did not specify a time frame when it will come to other phone makers; that's a decision that is ultimately up to each phone company. In the past, it has taken months for a rollout to reach the Android ecosystem - in fact, the last Google Android OS was released in February and is running on 12 percent of Android phones, according to Google's metrics.

However, as the world's most dominant operating system, changes to Android forecast how most of the world will be using their phones in the future. Here are key things to know about Android Pie:

             AI? Aye-aye: Google has been pretty clear that it sees its future lies in developing better artificial intelligence. Proof of that belief is all over Android Pie, from its features that read your battery consumption and adjust to your needs, to the ""adaptive brightness"" feature that does the same for the intensity of your screen.

Google has also been working on its digital assistant - Google Assistant - to give people better answers to their questions and greater hands-free control over their phones. Those little assists are also showing up in text form, with what Google calls App Actions. App Actions will automatically suggest activities for you, based on the time of day and what you've done with your phone before.

Google offers this example: ""Say it's Tuesday morning and you're preparing for your commute: you'll be suggested actions like navigating to work on Google Maps or resuming an audiobook with Google Play Books. These little prompts will appear just below the search bar on your page of apps.""

             Finding your way around: Android Pie also sports cosmetic changes aimed in part at making it easier to search through your phone. The biggest change to the way Android looks is the navigation system, which now consists of one on-screen software button rather than the three icons that have served as Android guides in the past.

With a single button, Android users will now have to swipe up to see their most recently used apps or to switch back to the last app they had open.

             Digital well-being: Google's also introduced its own set of tools aimed at giving people information on how they're using their phones. These tools are still in early testing, even for those who are able to download the operating system. Google said in a blog post that it will fully launch in the ""fall"" but did not give a more specific time frame. For those who want to sign up for the beta, they'll see features such as detailed breakdowns of how often they're using particular apps. They'll also get access to features such as ""Wind Down"" mode, which will put your phone into black-and-white at a prescribed bedtime.

             A deeper slice: Android Pie will also have a new feature, called Slices. (Yes, pun intended.) A ""slice"" is essentially a preview of an app: type something such as ""Lyft"" in the search bar, and you'll get a look at the cost and time estimate for a ride near you without having to open the app. The goal here seems to be getting you into apps faster but also to have more of your phone's navigation come in through the search bar - rather than having you flip through pages of applications. It will roll out later this year.

Overall, Android Pie shakes up a lot about how we navigate our phones - which also happens to give Google more ways to touch your smartphone experience - with App Actions, with search and voice to eliminate some of the swiping and tapping to which we've all become accustomed.",23,"Google said in a blog post that it will fully launch in the ""fall"" but did not give a more specific time frame.",0.6676216125488281,5.002703666687012,1

"Will there be a significant increase in worldwide search interest in the term “power outage” reported by Google Trends between 24 August 2018 and 7 September 2018?
",808271,"LAST week, Google held its I/O conference in California. As you'd expect, it was a technophile's dream. Google demoed how its personal assistant will soon be able make phone calls on your behalf and sound like a real human being. This new feature is powered, of course, by artificial intelligence (AI). Google photos will be upgraded to automatically suggest tweaks that improve your snaps. Again, this uses AI. Gmail will get a new feature called Smart Compose, which uses AI to suggest phrases as you type. And Google News is also getting a revamp, thanks to, you guessed it, AI.

The new Google News brings together several existing news products into one app and website. It will analyse the constant flow of news information as it hits the web in real time, and organise it into storylines.

Users can look forward to a daily briefing of five stories, personalised according to the users' reading habits. Simple controls will allow them to see more or less of a topic or from a particular publisher. There's a new visual format called newscasts, which offer different perspectives by bringing together articles, videos and quotes on a single topic from a host of sources. Plus, there's a feature called full coverage, which will allow users to get a deeper understanding of a story.

But it's not just readers that Google is courting with this new News product. It's batting its eyelashes at publishers, too. Google News promises to play nice with paywalls. Users will be able to subscribe for paid content with their Google account. There'll be no complex sign-up processes, no credit card numbers, and no new passwords. Users will be able to access paid content on all platforms and devices, on Google News, Google Search, and on publishers' own websites. Of course, Google will take a small cut of the subscription fee.

It all sounds impressive. But is this the future of news, or just another aggregator? Well, the first hurdle that Google will have to clear is the filter bubble issue that Facebook fell foul of with its news feed. Personalised news services will always be guilty of the sin of omission. Read a news website, or a newspaper and something interesting happens: serendipitous discovery of news. You find and read stories that you may not necessarily have gone looking for. Sometimes these are about difficult societal issues, sometimes they're informed opinions on something you know nothing about, sometimes they're utterly flippant.

However, they've made it onto the page because the publication in question deems them culturally relevant. In designing a newsfeed that kept users hooked for as long as possible, Facebook ditched this principal.

Google has said an algorithm fed by a few hundred signals will have the job of surfacing stories from trusted sources. And it will undoubtedly add that the user has full control over what appears in their daily briefing or newscasts. But it will be interesting to monitor how these features are populated, and what behaviours the new Google news promotes.

Privacy is another issue that Google news needs to address. With GDPR and a greater awareness of how firms like to store and use personal data, it will be interesting to see whether most people will be willing to trade privacy for personalised news. Given the amount of information Google holds on us thanks to products like Chrome, Android, Gmail and more, chances are convenience will win out.

Perhaps a more difficult issue will be keeping publishers sweet. Along with Apple, Facebook and a few others, it's a gatekeeper, controlling access to digital news. With Facebook deprioritising news, Apple likely to launch its own digital subscription product soon, and Google owning its own chunk of the audience, how long before publishers stop relying on their digital frenemies as online intermediaries? How long before they realise they should have a direct relationship with their customers? But the most interesting question relates to Google's all-pervasive AI crusade. Google's stated aim here is to save users' time by taking troublesome tasks off their plate. But let's look at the tasks they're trying to speed up. Making phonecalls. Writing emails. Staying informed.

Google may be able to shave nanoseconds off these activities, but are these really the tasks we need help with? Wouldn't we all be better off if we took the time to communicate with each other and stay informed, rather than outsourcing these activities to the apogee of surveillance capitalism? How much personalisation will it take before the world becomes a very impersonal place?",23,"But is this the future of news, or just another aggregator?",0.6759961247444153,5.002703666687012,1
"Will there be a significant increase in worldwide search interest in the term “power outage” reported by Google Trends between 24 August 2018 and 7 September 2018?
",226436,"New Delhi, May 09 -- Leading up to I/O '18, we saw Google revamp a lot of its apps and services with an updated Material Design. We've been hearing about something called ""Material Design 2"" for quite some time, so we assumed that would be the gist of Google's announcement at I/O.

 But instead, Google has today announced something called Material Theme Engine, which is basically a plugin to help designers implement Material Design in their apps. When building out a concept for an app or a redesign, one prototyping tool popular with designers is called Sketch. Material Theming is a plugin for Sketch that automatically adds the foundation for Material Design. It is then up to the designer to customize the look. So where does the ""Material Design 2"" come in? Well, like I said above, Material Theming is all about bringing the overarching design language to new apps while letting brands build out its own look and feel. With this in mind, ""Material Design 2"" is Google's Material Theme. So does all of this mean? Well, Material Design in and of itself isn't changing too much. Google did decide to update its look, but the main goal in introducing Material Theming is getting the right tools in the hands of developers to help them build better-looking apps that are also more user-friendly. Confused by the Material news today? It's simple. - Material Themes is a powerful framework for designing apps that gives developers more freedom. - What we've been calling ""Material Design 2"" is basically *Google's* Material Theme. - Stephen Hall (@hallstephenj) May 8, 2018",2,"We've been hearing about something called ""Material Design 2"" for quite some time, so we assumed that would be the gist of Google's announcement at I/O.

",673682,"General Relations The geography and ruling imams of north Yemen kept the country isolated from foreign influence before 1962. The country's relations with Saudi Arabia were defined by the Taif Agreement of 1934, which delineated the northernmost part of the border between the two kingdoms and set the framework for commercial and other kinds of contact. The Taif Agreement has been renewed periodically in 20-year increments, and its validity was reaffirmed in 1995. Relations with the British colonial authorities in Aden and the south were usually tense.

Regional Relations Yemen's border dispute with Saudi Arabia dates back 60 years. Over the years, fighting has erupted along this 1,300-mile frontier. Tensions arose once again in mid-July 1998 when an armed clash broke out on the Red Sea island of Duwaima, off the coast of Yemen. The fighting lasted for five hours until a cease-fire was negotiated. Each side has accused the other of initiating this latest conflict. On July 28, 1998, the two countries agreed to evacuate disputed areas until a solution to the border conflict could be found. Yemen has long disputed Saudi Arabia's claim to three Red Sea islands and parts of the ""Rub al-Khali"" (Empty Quarter), a desert region thought to contain valuable oil fields. In June 2000, a final land and sea border agreement granting Saudi sovereignty over the disputed islands was signed, and effectively ended the conflict between the two countries. The relationship between Oman and Yemen has been troublesome. Their common border has never been delineated, and border clashes occurred up until 1988. Yemen was believed to be a key refuge for rebels during an uprising against the Sultan of Oman in 1994, and the relationship between the two countries consequently soured. The two governments agreed to delineate the border in May 1999, but to date the border remains officially unsettled. Yemen has recently been actively seeking improved relations with many countries in the Middle East. In a meeting in April 1999, Vice President Hadi met with then-Prime Minister Sharif of Pakistan to discuss economic cooperation and their positions on the Middle East peace process. In May, President Saleh met with President Afwerki of Eritrea to discuss bilateral relations and the prospect of peace between Ethiopia and Eritrea. In February, Saleh had offered to mediate peace negotiations between the two countries. The offer was accepted by Eritrea, but turned down by Ethiopia. Also in May, Yemen reopened its embassy in Kuwait after it was closed in 1990 by Kuwaiti authorities after the government of Yemen denounced attacks by U.S. and allied forces against Iraq in the Gulf War. Yemen has improved its relations with Iran, and in April 2000 Iran and Yemen signed three cooperation agreements in the fields of politics, air transportation and fisheries. In August 2000, Yemen and Qatar signed eight cooperation agreements.  Relations with European Countries  In July 2002, the Italian government relieved Yemen from $20 million worth of debts. The minister of interior said that Italy decided to single out this loan to Yemen so that the funds could be used toward the establishment of the Marine patrol police (MPP) meant to prevent the flow and infiltration of suspected terrorists to Yemen.  Then, in December 2002, Russia and Yemen signed an agreement to strengthen political cooperation and cooperation in trade and economic, military, oil and gas, and other areas.  Other Significant Relations  The United States (U.S.) established diplomatic relations with the imamate in 1946, and the United States was one of the first countries to recognize the Yemen Arab Republic, doing so on Dec. 19, 1962. On June 6, 1967, Y.A.R. under Egyptian influence, broke diplomatic relations with the United States in the wake of the Arab-Israeli conflict of that year. Relations were restored following a visit to Sanaa by U.S. Secretary of State William P. Rogers in July 1972.  During a 1979 border conflict between the Yemen Arab Republic and the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, the United States cooperated with Saudi Arabia to greatly expand the security assistance program to the YAR by providing F-5 aircraft, tanks, vehicles and training. George Bush, while vice president, visited in April 1986, and President Ali Abdallah Saleh visited the United States in January 1990. From 1973 to 1990, the United States provided the Y.A.R. with assistance in the agriculture, education, health, and water sectors. Many Yemenis were sent on U.S. government scholarships to study in the Middle East and in the United States. There was a Peace Corps program with about 50 volunteers. The U.S. Information Service operates an English-language institute in Sanaa.Yemen expressed its opposition to U.S. and allied strikes on Iraq during the Gulf War and after. Due to the Yemeni government's improvements and its anti-terrorist actions since the mid-1990s, the strategically located port of Aden was approved as suitable for occasional U.S. naval stopovers. Since early 1998, limited military to military contact has taken place the between Yemeni and American governments. The signing of a contract between the two governments allows American military crafts to use Yemeni shipping lanes while patrolling the Persian Gulf to oversee U.N. sanctions against Iraq. It was under this agreement the USS Cole docked in Aden on Oct. 12, 2000. However, the relationship between the two countries has been strained after the USS Cole attack. The Yemeni government's attitude has been characterized as ""obstructionist,"" and an agreement on the coordination of the investigation between the two governments was only reached in mid-November 2000. The trial of the suspects was scheduled to be held in Yemen.By January 2002, Yemen was still holding several people in relation to the USS Cole attack, but Yemeni officials said that their trial had been postponed following a request from the U.S. that the investigation be widened further. U.S. military advisers were sent to Yemen after the September 11 attacks to help combat the alleged presence of Al-Qaida members in remote areas of the country. As part of a crackdown on terror and suspected al-Qaida members, Yemen started to expel in early February 2002 more than 100 foreign Islamic scholars, including British and French nationals. Five of 17 men named in a US Federal Bureau of Investigation terrorism alert were being held in Yemen in mid-February 2002. The five are all Yemeni nationals said to have been trained in Afghanistan.  At the time, the Yemeni Government said there may be other Al-Qaida suspects in the country, but also said the network has no military training camps or organized presence. They were already in custody when the U.S. released a list of suspects earlier in the week, Yemeni officials said, having been arrested at the end of 2001 or in early 2002.On March 15, 2002, an explosion occurred outside the U.S. embassy in the Yemeni capital Sanaa - a day after U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney visited the country. There were no injuries and no damage was done. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said two objects had been thrown, which appeared to bounce off the embassy walls and then explode. One man was taken into custody; police officials at the scene said security guards fired at the man, who was believed to have been wounded.Security in Yemen had already been a major concern for the U.S. since a boat packed with explosives had rammed the USS Cole in October 2000. The incident came a day after a brief visit to Yemen by the U.S. vice president, who was halfway through an 11-country tour of the Middle East. His talks with President Ali Abdullah Saleh focused on co-operation against terrorism. It was the highest-level visit by a U.S. official in 15 years. Earlier in the week, Americans in Yemen were warned that they were in danger of being targeted by terrorists.Then, in April 2002, Yemeni police fired live shots in the air and used tear gas to stop thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters reaching the U.S. embassy in the capital, Sanaa, in protest of U.S. and Israeli actions. Witnesses said at least four people were injured when police broke up the rally of an estimated 5,000 demonstrators demanding the closure of the embassy. Please see the ""Political Conditions"" section of this review for more in relations with the United States. Meanwhile, scores of Yemenis are believed to have joined Al-Qaida - the organization blamed for the September 11 attacks on the United States. But the authorities in Yemen are keen to get rid of their reputation as a safe haven for terrorists. They have intensified military patrols in the Marib area, east of Sanaa, in the hunt for Al-Qaida suspects.As part of its allegiance with the U.S.-led global fight against terrorism, Yemeni President Ali Abdallah Saleh in August 2002 ordered the formation of an anti-terror intelligence agency. The purpose of the agency was to collect information linked to the country's security with a key task to thwart ""infiltration by hostile elements.""  The United States had previously offered to help train military personnel for Yemen in coordination with its global anti-terror strategy.By October 2002, Yemeni officials said they had deported thousands of foreigners who were studying at Islamic religious institutions scattered throughout the country since the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks on the U.S. Other students that were found to have links to al Qaida were arrested.Tragedy struck on Oct. 6, 2002, when an explosion on a French tanker occurred off the coast of Yemen. A small boat carrying explosives crashed into the Limburg tanker, killing one crew member, wounding 24 others, and sending more than 90,000 barrels of oil pouring into the Gulf of Aden. At first, Yemeni officials were declaring the explosion to be an accident. However, ten days later, Yemeni authorities publicly declared that the blast was a deliberate act of terrorism. Both French and Yemeni officials investigated the matter but were unable to identify those responsible. No group claimed culpability. The style of the attack resembled the suicide bombing of the U.S. warship Cole in Yemen's Aden port in 2000, according to observers.In early November 2002, threats of an attack forced the closure of the U.S. Embassy in Yemen, following U.S. involvement in the killing of six Yemeni Muslim militants suspected of having links with Osama bin Laden's al Qaida network. The embassy re-opened four days later with beefed up security. after being closed for four days following a U.S. military strike which killed six Al Qaeda suspects in the country.By late December 2002, the United States and Yemen had announced a plan to protect a number of oil positions in the Arab country and to carry out new operations against suspected al Qaida members. Yemeni forces were reportedly being trained on new techniques to consolidate cooperation with the United States.Meanwhile at year's end, three American missionaries were shot fatally in the head by an alleged Muslim extremist. Another missionary suffered a gunshot wound to the stomach. The attack was condemned by U.S.-based Muslim advocacy groups and individuals as well as by Britain. The killer, a Yemeni gunman identified as 32-year-old Ali Abdulrazzak al-Kamel, told police after his arrest that he had shot the three Americans to ""cleanse his religion and get closer to Allah.""In early March 2003, two Yemeni citizens being held in Germany were charged in the United States with conspiring to provide support to terrorist groups. And, in mid-March, three people, including a U.S. and a Canadian oil-field worker, were killed by a Yemeni gunman who killed himself after shooting several co-workers.The incident that occurred in a field drilled by the American-owned Nabors company for Hunt Oil of Dallas. The gunman was identified as Naji Ahmad al-Kumain, who was also employed at the field. Although anti-American sentiment is strong in Yemen and other Arab countries over U.S. policies, including Israel and Iraq, local observers did not rule out that the killings might have been motivated by personal reasons connected with work.The United Kingdom announced in late February 2003 its plans to shut its embassy in Yemen in the face of increased fears over security. British citizens were advised to leave the Arab state, which the United Kingdom believed to contain a number of Islamic terrorists. The diplomatic missions in the country had been kept open in order to provide assistance to those from the United Kingdom who remained in Yemen.Update --On Dec. 17, 2009, Yemeni authorities said that 34 al-Qaida operatives had been killed in ground and air strikes.  Later, it was reported that an al-Qaida leader and a Muslim preacher (Anwar al-Awlaki) who was linked to the attack by United States intelligence at an army base in Texas were among those militants killed.* The Yemeni government hailed these developments as a major victory in the ongoing fight against terrorism.Critics, however, have said that Yemeni troops have been occupied fighting  a Shi'a rebellion in the north of the country, and a secessionist movement to the south, effectively curtailing more dogged efforts to fight the terrorist threat posed by al-Qaida in Yemen.  Accordingly, the success in this operation was thought to have been at least partially due to  efforts of either the Saudis or the United States.  Indeed, both countries have been pressuring Yemen to carry out a crackdown on al-Qaida, which is reported to be operating within Osama Bin Laden's ancestral homeland.  To that end, intelligence sources from the United States and other places have been issuing warnings that al-Qaida was moving some of its field commanders and operatives from the Afghan-Pak region to Yemen and Somalia.

*It should be noted that reports of Awlaki's death were subsequently proved to be untrue.    Special Report

Summary:

Yemen's al-Qaida connection has become the focus of geopolitical anxiety in the aftermath of an attempted bombing of a U.S. airliner on Christmas Day.  A Nigerian national charged with attempting to bomb the aircraft said he received explosives and training  from al-Qaida in Yemen.  Fears of terrorist attacks emanating from that country have led to increased anti-terrorism support for Yemen.

The Foiled Attack:

On Dec. 25, 2009, a Nigerian national on a flight from Amsterdam in the Netherlands to Detroit in the United States attempted to carry out a bomb attack.  The Christmas Day incident occurred when Northwest Airlines Flight 253, carrying 278 passengers and 11 crew, was less than half an hour from arriving at its destination.

The incident ensued when the suspect, identified as 23-year old Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, tried to ignite an incendiary device, and burnt his leg in so doing. No one else was hurt in what United States officials described as a failed terrorist attack.  Passengers on the aircraft described a scene of panic in the cabin after they  detected smoke and flames.  There were some suggestions that the attempted bomb attack was thwarted when one passenger, Dutch tourist Jasper Schuringa, jumped across several rows of seats to tackle the suspect, and other passengers then helped to fully subdue him.  Water, blankets and a fire extinguisher were used to put out the fire.  A report by the Associated Press noted that the lives of the passengers and crew about Flight 253 were actually saved because the explosive device failed to detonate due to an apparent malfunction.  Nonetheless, Schuringa was hailed as a hero for his quick reaction to the unfolding crisis aboard the flight.

The aircraft was soon cleared for emergency landing at Detroit Metropolitan Airport where Abdulmutallab was taken into official custody and treated for the aforementioned burns at the  University of Michigan Medical Center in Ann Arbor. While there, United States District Judge Paul Borman officially charged Abdulmutallab  with placing a destructive device on an aircraft, and attempting to destroy a passenger jet by detonating a bomb. According to the Associated Press, Abdulmutallab was asked in English if he understood the charges being brought against him and responded, ""Yes, I do.""  Abdulmutallab's lawyer later said he had been transferred to a federal prison in Milan, Michigan.

Abdulmutallab reportedly told United States authorities that he  was acting on behalf of the notorious terrorist enclave, al-Qaida.  Indeed, ABC news reported that Abdulmutallab told authorities that he spent one month being trained by al-Qaida in Yemen. Abdulmutallab also apparently explained that he acquired the explosive powder from al-Qaida operatives in Yemen, which he attached to his leg and  mixed in a concoction with liquid chemicals, with the intent of causing an explosion.  Subsequent media reports indicated that the highly explosive substance was  pentaerythritol (PETN) -- the same substance used by the failed show bomber, Richard Reid, exactly eight years earlier in December 2001, when he attempted to bring down a flight from France to the United States.  CNN reported that the amount of PETN in this 2009 case was certainly enough to destroy the aircraft, presumably killing all those on board.

Counter-terrorism authorities in the Netherlands confirmed that Abdulmutallab first boarded a KLM  flight in Lagos, Nigeria, bound for Amsterdam.  It was not known at the time of writing if Abdulmutallab had the explosives attached to his body when his originating flight departed from Nigeria at the very start of the journey. In fact, the logistical details were complicated by the revelation that Abdulmutallab actually flew from Ghana to Nigeria on a one-way ticket.Nevertheless, once Abdulmutallab arrived  in the Netherlands, he transferred to the Northwest flight headed to the United States. According to the Justice Department in the United States,  Abdulmutallab at that point had ""a device attached to his body"" when he boarded the flight in Amsterdam bound for Detroit.  He presumably was allowed to board that flight because he had a valid United States visa.

There were serious questions being raised regarding the ease with which the transportation of explosives was able to elude detection. It was possible that security conditions in Nigeria helped in this regard.  That is to say, the Lagos airport has long held the dubious distinction of being one of the least efficient travel centers in the world, where lax security runs rampant, largely as a result of widespread corruption.  On the other hand, later evidence showing the explosives had been carried in a specially-made pouch within the alleged bombers undergarments would suggest that detection would be almost impossible using a regular magnetometers, and would require more intrusive body scanning techniques. 

Accordingly, security at airports worldwide was expected to increase.  For his part, United States President Barack Obama ordered that air travel be subject to heightened security measures. Homeland Security and the Transportation Security Administration in the United States warned that additional screening procedures would be implemented, however, they declined to specify particulars, suggesting that the intent was to preserve the element of surprise for obvious security reasons.  Certain international aircraft carriers, though, such as Air Canada and British Airways, noted on their websites that passengers on international flights would be subject to much more intense security, and would be prevented from accessing carry-on luggage or getting up from their seats at certain points during flights. Delays, particularly on trans-Atlantic flights, were being anticipated.

White House spokesperson Robert Gibbs announced that a review of air safety was underway.  On one front, there would be an investigation into the systems in place for detecting explosives before passengers board flights.  On another front, there would be an examination of the terrorist identification protocols, in light of the revelation that  Abdulmutallab was already listed in a broad terrorist database and yet allowed to board a flight.  Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano  explained in an interview with CNN that despite the fact that Abdulmutallab's own father had warned the United States' embassy in Nigeria that his son might have jihadist inclinations, it was not sufficient actionable information to have moved him to the terrorism ""no fly"" list.  The actual criteria for inclusion in these various databases -- some overseen by the Director of National Intelligence and some by the Federal Bureau of Investigation -- was not made known to the public.

Nevertheless, the fact that Abdulmutallab's own father -- a well-known Nigerian banker -- had gone to such lengths to  notify United States officials of his suspicions, along with revelations that Abdulmutallab had purchased a ticket from Ghana using cash and was carrying only one carry-on piece of luggage, were matters expected to be subjects of grave critique in the coming weeks.  Typically, such actions would be flagged as suspicious and indicative of a possible terrorist threat and so Secretary Napolitano's assurances that flying was still ""very, very safe"" were unlikely to go unchallenged.  However, despite the perception of breaches in the air transport security system, preliminary examinations in the Netherlands -- where Flight 253 originated -- found that existing security procedures were correctly followed.  The obvious conclusion, therefore, has been that current security technology does not facilitate the easy detection of explosive devices and substances.  Indeed, as indicated above, most passengers in airports have to pass through only magnetometers, which detect metal and not explosives.  Accordingly, there was likely to be intensified focus in the future on equipping  airports with ""puffer"" machines that detect explosive powder residue, manual hand swabs to the same end, bomb-sniffing dogs, as well as body scanners.Meanwhile, attention was on Abdulmutallab himself, who was born into a life of relative privilege. He once studied engineering at a prestigious school in the United Kingdom, but his Islamic views had caught the attention of his own family, including his father, Alhaji Umaru Mutallab. Indeed, media reports suggested that he was estranged from his family, actually  losing touch with them in the months he may have been living in Yemen. The official Saba News Agency in Yemen subsequently reported that Abdulmutallab had, in fact, been living in that country from August 2009 to the start of December 2009 while he attended the Sanaa Institute for the Arabic Language (SIAL). Nigerian authorities suggested that Abdulmutallab used surreptitious means to re-enter Nigeria before departing on the trip that would span three continents.Yemen and al-Qaida:

The United States government has been reticent about drawing conclusions about a global terrorist plot in this case. Nevertheless, this attempt to carry out an in-flight bombing on Christmas Day appeared to be in keeping with al-Qaida's latest terrorist directives.  The NEFA Foundation  published an October 2009 al-Qaida article calling for operatives to use ""small explosives"" to kill ""apostates"" and Westerners at airports and in aircrafts. Moreover, Abdulmutallab -- the man at the center of the Christmas Day attempted terror attack -- has expressly conjured up al-Qaida in his interrogations with authorities.  Finally, a Yemen-based branch of the network removed some prevailing doubts about the orchestration of the failed terrorist attack  by claiming responsibility.

It should be noted that al-Qaida was not the only meaningful reference point offered by Abdulmutallab to the authorities during initial interrogations.  Also of significance was his mentioning of Yemen as being the place he garnered the PETN, as well as the venue of his Islamic militant training. Yemen -- the ancestral home of Osama Bin Laden  -- is strategically located at the end of the Arabian peninsula and stretches from the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden.  It is also located in close proximity to another emerging al-Qaida haven -- Somalia.  Accordingly, Yemen has increasingly factored into the discussions of global terrorism.

Al-Qaida's satellite base in Yemen may be attempting to gain ascendancy at a time when global attention is on the Afghan-Pak region. To this end,  Anwar Eshki, the head of the Middle East Center for Strategic and Legal Studies, has argued that  al-Qaida in Yemen ""is stronger than it was a year ago"" and intent on turning that country into a major base of operations against the West.  Part of that strength may be derived from the fact that Saudi and Yemeni elements of al-Qaida have joined forces to form the merged entity, al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula.  The Saudi authorities, who have carried out a crackdown on its elements, have suggested that many Saudi operatives have fled to Yemen.  The Saudi authorities have sometimes accused Yemen of not doing enough to round up its own bastions of extremism.

In the aftermath of the failed terror plot aboard the airliner discussed above, the government of Yemen indicated that while it had the will to deal with al-Qaida, it was hampered by a lack of support. Nonetheless, the Yemeni authorities insisted that they have been working with regional and Western powers to crush militancy within its borders, noting that such action was in the country's own best interests since Islamic extremists pose a grave national security threat.  It should also be noted that in the latter part of 2009, faced with the threat that Yemen was becoming a stronghold for Islamic extremists, United States intelligence was credited with helping Yemeni forces carry out military offensives against major al-Qaida bases in that country, much to the consternation of al-Qaida itself.  But the Yemeni authorities have to contend with not only the al-Qaida threat, but also a secessionist movement in the south and a Shi'a Zaidi rebellion in the north.  This complex political terrain has left large isolated swaths of land vulnerable for use by extremists of many stripes in Yemen.

Meanwhile, Evan Kohlmann, a senior investigator for the NEFA Foundation, warned that rivalry among al-Qaida's branches could be a driving force behind the uptick in Yemen-based al-Qaida activities.  He said, ""There's now a competition in the world of al-Qaida between various al-Qaida factions, with each trying to prove themselves and prove their worth.""  There could therefore be an attempt by Yemen-based al-Qaida to distinguish itself as an active base of anti-Western and Jihadist militancy.

This threat was amplified when, a week after the aforementioned attempted terrorist attack, the Yemeni authorities warned that hundreds of al-Qaida operatives were present in Yemen and could be plotting further terrorist attacks. This claim appeared to coincide with warnings made by Abdulmutallab -- the man behind the attempted Christmas Day attack -- who said that there were other al-Qaida operatives who stood ready to strike with fresh attacks.

Some of those al-Qaida operatives could well be among the hundreds already present in Yemen, as noted by the Yemeni authorities.  But Yemen's location close to Somalia might  also be a factor. The militant extremist Islamist group, al-Shabab, which has held sway in portions of Somalia, has warned it would send its fighters to assist fellow Islamic militants in Yemen.  Sheikh Mukhtar Robow Abu Mansour of al-Shabab reportedly said: ""We tell our Muslim brothers in Yemen that we will cross the water between us and reach your place to assist you fight the enemy of Allah.""

With attention now focused on the Islamic extremist threat emanating from Yemen, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown called for a summit to be convened in London at the end of January 2010 simultaneously with a pre-scheduled conference on the future of Afghanistan. The objective of the summit on Yemen would be identify Yemen's counter-terrorism requirements and to determine ways of dealing with the thrust towards extremism via aid and reform. Prime Minister Brown also urged all key international partners to be involved in this endeavor saying, ""The international community must not deny Yemen the support it needs to tackle extremism.""  He also announced that the United Kingdom would commit 100 million British pounds and intelligence support to Yemen -- the most significant outlay by any global power to that Middle eastern country.

Meanwhile, General David Petraeus, head of United States military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia, visited the president of Yemen,  Ali Abdallah Saleh, to pledge American support in the fight against al-Qaida.  One day earlier, Petraeus announced that the United States would double its counter-terrorism aid to Yemen in 2010.

Across the globe, clearly there was increasing anxiety about Yemen becoming a failed state -- the very environment within which violent extremist groups often find safe haven. To that end, Mark Pritchard, a British parliamentarian and the vice chairman of the Parliamentary Yemen Group, said: ""If Yemen does become a failed State it will provide a safe haven for terrorists with close proximity to important shipping routes and neighboring oil-producing Saudi Arabia. The stakes for the region and the West are very high indeed.""

For its part, the government of Yemen appeared to give tacit sanction for greater  assistance from  the Western powers with the Yemeni Foreign Minister Abu Bakr al-Qirbi saying in an interview with the BBC, ""We need more training. We have to expand our counter terrorism units and this means providing them with the necessary training, military equipment, ways of transportation - we are very short of helicopters. The United States can do a lot, Britain can do a lot, the European Union can do a lot in that regard.""

Such help would be of paramount importance given the reports in the early days of 2010 that al-Qaida was planning an attack on the Yemeni capital of Sanaa. In an interview with ABC News, John Brennan, the top counter-terrorism adviser to United States President Obama,  said, ""We know that they [al-Qaida operatives] have been targeting our embassy, our embassy personnel."" Because of this threat, Brennan announced that the United States  was temporarily closing its embassy in Sanaa.  The British and French governments reportedly moved to do the same.  Brennan's claims were consistent with a call from al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula encouraging Muslims to assist in ""killing every crusader who works at their embassies or other places.""

Latest Developments:

On Jan. 5, 2010, it was reported that Yemeni security forces killed several suspected al-Qaida militants as part of its ongoing effort to crush al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula.  According to reports, the Yemeni forces ambushed a cadre of militants in the Arhab district --  about 40 miles north of the Yemeni capital -- effectively igniting a violent clash with the militants, ultimately yielding the aforementioned deaths.

But even as this offensive operation was taking place, the Yemeni president was signaling that it was interested in engaging with al-Qaida in an effort to end the violence in his country.  President Ali Abdullah Saleh suggested he would grant leniency to members of al-Qaida who were willing to enter talks with his government and renounce violence. In an interview that was broadcast on Abu Dhabi TV, he said: ""Dialogue is the best way ... even with al-Qaida, if they set aside their weapons and return to reason.""  The move was essentially an extension of the Yemeni president's previous stance in dealing with al-Qaida.  Accordingly, it was expected to be met with grave disapproval from Western powers who have viewed it as a failed strategy, given the terrorist threat emanating from Yemen.

Yemen is the base of both foreign and local al-Qaida fighters.  The local fighters are often aided by relatives, typically as a result of tribal loyalty more than ideology.  However, when these fighters are killed or arrested by government forces, these heavily-armed tribes often are emotionally driven to increase support of the militants.  Meanwhile, Yemen has also been home to thousands of Islamic militants who are veterans of several ""holy wars"" in other countries and regions, including Afghanistan, Bosnia and Chechnya.  While most of these Islamic militant veterans are no longer active, they nonetheless maintain their extremist views in keeping with al-Qaida ideology. As noted by Ali Saif Hassan, the manager of a Yemeni group that mediates between the government and opposition: ""It is difficult to draw the line between who is a fundamentalist and who is al-Qaida. It's a spectrum."" As constituents of the country, these elements form part of the broader anti-American and anti-Western base of the country, over which President Saleh has only fragile control.

It is this matter of fragile control that informs President Saleh's stance.  With a rebellion in the north, a secessionist movement in the south, extremists in other parts of the country, and actual control over only Sanaa, Yemeni President Saleh has moved cautiously in the fight against al-Qaida.  This wary and cagey positioning has been largely due to President Saleh's concern that working closely with the United States and the West on anti-terrorism efforts could spark a backlash.

In fact, the Yemeni leader has to walk a political tightrope of sorts.  He has had to crack down on the rebels, secessionists and militants in order to maintain national security, while simultaneously demonstrating anti-terrorism efforts for geopolitical reasons. Yet, in so doing, President Saleh cannot afford to alienate significant elements of Yemeni society.  To this end, he must demonstrate the precise amount of cooperation with the Western powers to assuage them, while currying favor with the extremist elements of his own country.  In many senses, it has been the same challenge facing other leaders in the region who must contend with a volatile population base while attending to the geopolitical and national security threats posed by militant Islamic terrorism.

The other territorial battles in Yemen have also factored into the country's complex landscape and challenging security situation. In January 2010, Yemeni security forces entered into the sixth month of conflict with Shi'ite rebels in the northern part of the country. This was part of the government's ongoing ""Operation Scorched Earth"" offensive aimed at ending the Houthi rebellion. The situation in the north has intersected to some degree with the increasing global attention on Yemen as an emerging base of al-Qaida extremist militants.  The government of Yemen has had to balance fighting terrorism and rebellion with appeasing extremist elements of the society, amidst a country with rebels in the north and secessionists in the south.  To satisfy these contradictory objectives, the Yemeni government has at times aligned itself with controversial Islamists.  Among them has been Sheik Abdul-Majid al-Zindan whom the United States has classified as a terrorist due to his alleged connection to al-Qaida, and who has gained notoriety for his anti-Western rhetoric. But the Yemeni government has relied on its alliance with cleric like al-Zindani in the fight against the Shi'ite rebels in the north, to oppose the secessionists in the south, and to hold onto its tenuous grip on power.

Cast along the complicated landscape has been the growing international call for the government to take a harder stance against al-Qaida, and the reality that such a move could ignite a fierce and deleterious repercussions from the Islamic fundamentalist and tribal factions of Yemeni society.  Indeed, as noted by Ali Mohammed Omar, a Yemeni who, according to a report by the Associated Press, fought in Afghanistan in the early 1990s and met Osama Bin Laden: ""Any movement against al-Qaida will lead to the fall of the Yemeni regime.""  He went on to note that if the United States or its allies were to become too directly involved in Yemen, ""the whole (Yemeni) people will become al-Qaida. Instead of 30 or 40 people, it would become millions.""

Clearly aware of this potentiality, while the United States and the United Kingdom have increased support for anti-terrorism efforts in Yemen in the form of increased funding and training for counter-terrorism forces (noted above), there is no indication of an overt military presence in that country.  In fact, in an interview with People magazine, United States President Obama made clear that he had no intention of deploying American troops to Yemen (or Somalia), despite the nations' growing importance as emerging centers of terrorism on the global landscape.  To this end, President Obama said: ""I have no intention of sending U.S. boots on the ground in these regions."" Instead, he suggested that working with international partners on the situation in Yemen would be the best course. President Obama also emphasized that the main center of al-Qaida activity was still in the Afghan-Pak region.

The president's sentiment was reflected in statements by General David Petraeus, who has been directing the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.  In an interview with Christiane Amanpour on CNN, he said of the Yemeni government that it was ""quite clear that Yemen does not want to have American ground troops there. And that's a ... good response for us to hear, certainly."" He continued, ""We would always want a host nation to deal with a problem itself. We want to help. We're providing assistance."" Echoing what was clearly the Obama administration's position on the matter, Admiral Michael Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in an interview with Fareed Zakaria on CNN, ""Right now, as far as any kind of boots on the ground there, with respect to the United States, ... that's not a possibility.""In late January 2010, the Obama administration in the United States said that in addition to expanding military support to Yemen in the fight against al-Qaida, it would also bolster its economic assistance program in that country, with an eye on decreasing the influence of  Islamist extremists.  In this way, the United States Pentagon would  provide increased military cooperation, training and counter-terrorism forces, while the Department of State and the United States Agency for International Development would work on preparing a development plan that targeting tribal youth who are particularly vulnerable recruits to al-Qaida.

Another Foiled Attack with Connections to Yemen:In late October 2010, bombs were found hidden in cargo planes originating in Yemen and bound for Jewish synagogues in the city of Chicago in the United States.  The devices containing pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN)  and plastic explosives  mixed with lead azide (used to detonate explosives) were inserted into printer cartridges and mailed via cargo shipment from Yemen.

In one case, a printer was found on a cargo plane in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates  equipped with a circuit board linked to a mobile phone card. In another case,  a explosive device was intercepted at the East Midlands Airport in the United Kingdom only after an initial search yielded no results.  Authorities in the United Kingdom were then told that the explosives found in Dubai had been hidden in the printer, thus a more thorough secondary search, this time with positive results.

British  Prime Minister David Cameron issued the disturbing news that the explosive device was designed to be detonated on the aircraft, although it was not known when it was intended to explode. In practical terms, this meant that it was unknown as to whether  the bombs could be detonated remotely whileairliners were in flight, or, when the packages were opened at their destinations in the United States.  John Brennan, counter-terrorism adviser to United States President Barack Obama, warned that the bombs were ""sophisticated"" and ""self-contained"" devices, intended to be detonated by the terrorists according to their chosen schedules.  Given the use of the particular explosives within the printer cartridges, it would have been difficult for any bomb-sniffing dogs or x-ray machines to discover them.

Both discoveries were made thanks  to intelligence passed on from Saudi Arabian authorities as well as a British M16 agent working in Yemen.  The Saudi-based intelligence was linked to a tip received from a repentant al-Qaida member, Jabr al-Faifi, once held at Guantanamo Bay. Blame was quickly placed on al-Qaida in Yemen, which has been known to attempt bomb attacks using PETN.  Attention was also focused on a well-known al-Qaida explosives expert, Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri, who was believed to be the bomb maker from Saudi Arabia now living in Yemen.

In that country, now regarded as an emerging base of radical jihadist Islamists such as al-Qaida, a female student was arrested in the Yemeni capital of Sanaa on suspicion of dispatching the explosives-laden packages. The woman's location was traced via the telephone number she furnished to the cargo company.  Given the threat, local offices of the cargo firms, UPS and FedEx, shut down freight operations in Yemen, while several countries placed a halt on cargo transported from Yemen.  Yemeni officials were additionally on the hunt for additional suspects believed to be involved in procuring forged documents and identification cards.  Also under suspicion were two language institutions in Yemen believed to be linked with the orchestrator of the mail bomb plot.

Meanwhile, cargo airliners were not the only ones involved in what appeared to be thwarted terror attacks.  News reports indicated that at least one of the packages containing a bomb traveled on passenger flights.  To that end, one package was transported on a Qatar Airlines flight from Yemen to Qatar, and then transferred to another Qatar Airlines flight onto Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.  This revelation raised questions about the safety of global travel, given the transportation of cargo in civilian airliners.

Under fire for yet another terrorist attempt emanating from his country, Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh said that his country would keep up its fight against al-Qaida ""in co-operation with its partners.""  However, the Yemeni leader intimated that his country would balk at the notion of intervention by foreign powers saying, ""But we do not want anyone to interfere in Yemeni affairs by hunting down al-Qaeda.""

It was yet to be seen how foreign powers would respond to this call since in December 2009, a Nigerian national tried to detonate explosives on a flight destined for the American city of Detroit.  That plot was thwarted by a vigilant passenger on the same flight but the plot was traced back to al-Qaida in Yemen. (See above for more details related to that attempted act of terrorism.)

For its part, the Obama administration in the United States was making it clear that it wanted to assist President Saleh in the fight against al-Qaida. Indeed, the United States government was sending inspectors to Yemen to investigate cargo security practices, given the ostensible assumption that further bombs could be transported in the same way as the two currently at issue.  The United States was also reiterating its commitment to destroying the terror enclave, al-Qaida.

Special ReportWikileaks Revelations --The notorious website, Wikileaks, in the fall of 2010 published hundreds of thousands of secret United States documents dealing with the 2003 invasion of Iraq and its aftermath.  Earlier, Wikileaks published tens of thousands of secret documents dealing with the war in Afghanistan.  The United States military analyst responsible for originally leaking the documents was himself awaiting trial for charges related to the illegal release of the materials. As well, the director of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, was  wanted by the Swedish authorities in connections with rape allegations.  These two legal cases aside,  at the close of 2010, further secret documents were being revealed, this time with possible implications for sensitive diplomatic relations around the world.  Some of the key leaks revealed in secret cable correspondence included the following with regard to Yemen--

As published by the Guardian, secret dispatches dated September 2009 revealed far more involved United States military involvement in Yemen than had been previously believed, largely a result of United States fears that Yemen was becoming a haven for al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula.  The cables suggested that Yemen allowed the United States to carry out secret air strikes against suspected al-Qaida terrorists, while Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh claimed that the strikes were being carried out by Yemen's military as part of its own anti-militancy offensive.  Following a second strike in 2009, President Saleh told General David Petraeus, the head of United States Central Command at the time, ""We'll continue saying the bombs are ours, not yours.""  A December 2009 dispatch had United States Stephen Seche rAmabssador explaining that ""Yemen insisted it must maintain the status quo regarding the official denial of U.S. involvement.""  Seche also noted that Saleh supported continued operations until the threat of militant Islamic terrorism emanating from Yemen was fully eradicated.Special ReportDrone strike kills al-Qaida in Yemen terrorist orchestrator, U.S.-born al-Alwaki.

At the close of September 2011, it was reported in the international media that a  United States drone strike had killed Anwar al-Alwaki -- a United States-born terrorist orchestrator and propaganda communicator for al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).  The  Yemeni Defense Ministry confirmed the deaths of Alwaki  and a number of his associates in the Yemeni province of Jawf.

As an English-speaking United States citizen, Alwaki used his command of language and biculturalism, along with modern media, to reach out to young Muslims in across the world with the objective of radicalizing them and urging them to turn to terrorism. He was also believed to have been responsible for orchestrating a number of attempted attacks, including the recruitment of infamous Nigerian ""underwear""  bomber, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who tried but failed to blow up  a United States-bound airliner on Christmas Day in 2009. Alwaki was also blamed for inspiring United States Major Nidal Malik Hasan to carry out a 2009 attack on an army base in Texas that left more that a dozen people dead.  He was additionally linked with the  failed bombing in New York's Times Square in 2010.

United States President Barack Obama hailed the death of Awlaki in Yemen as a ""major blow"" to the terror enslave, al-Qaida.  President Obama said that the AQAP figure was instrumental in the ""planning and directing efforts to murder innocent Americans"" and was  ""directly responsible for the death of many Yemeni citizens.""President Obama also used the occasion to emphasize the United States' commitment to fighting terrorism. He said, ""This is further proof that al-Qaida and  its affiliates will find no safe haven anywhere in the world.""

At home in the United States, there were some challenges to the legitimacy of eliminating a United States citizen without a trial.  That being said, the United States government could well argue that it was operating within legal bounds by targeting an enemy of the state, and a leader of a terror enclave that had declared war on the United States.

Update on the threat of al-Qaida and terrorism from Yemen:

In a separate but related development on April 15, 2012, joint United States-Yemen air raids on al-Qaida hideouts in Abyan province eliminated at least 16 militants.  Air strikes were also launched on al-Qaida targets in neighboring province of Shabwa, ultimately disposing of about eight militants.  As has been the case in the past, al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula denied that any of its fighters died in the air raids.

Regardless of the actual casualty list, it was clear that the resurgent al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula was taking advantage of the year-long political conflict that has plagued Yemen, ultimately leading to the resignation of long-serving Marshal Ali Abdallah Saleh in late 2011 and the election of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi in early 2012.  Despite the installation of new leadership in Yemen, it was apparent that the fight against al-Qaida terrorists was continuing in Yemen, and that al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula -- locally known as Ansar al-Sharia (Partisans of Islamic Law)  -- remained a threat to regional stability. Indeed, the terror enclave has recently taken control of significant swaths of territory in Yemen's restive southern provinces, leading newly -elected President Hadi to assert that the fight against al-Qaida is at the forefront of his political agenda on a daily basis.On April 18, 2012, the terror enclave, al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, claimed responsibility for the kidnapping of a Saudi diplomat in Yemen, which apparently ensued a month prior. In an interview with Voice of America, a spokesperson for the government of Saudi Arabia said the terrorist group threatened to kill the diplomat if Saudi authorities refused to release jailed militants and pay a ransom. The Saudi government  said the demands were made over the telephone by a terror suspect known as Mashaal Rasheed al-Shawdakhi.Further attacks were also threatened against Saudi interests during the call.

A day later on April 19, 2012, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) said it wanted to actively target threats emanating from al-Qaida in Yemen. CIA Director David Petraeus was calling for authority to conduct ""signature strikes"" against al-Qaida targets in Yemen, according to a report by the Washington Post.  At issue was a desire to move forward with surgical strikes against those who might ""have a direct interest"" in attacking the United States. Such action would be of the type that resulted in the CIA drone strike in 2011 that  killed Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-born leader of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula.  Since the election of Abdu Rabo Mansour Hadi as president of Yemen, activity by al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula has increased, presumably due to a desire by the terror enclave the test the new leadership of the country.  To that end, Yemeni authorities have warned that an attack on the country's capital could be in the offing. With such threats pending, there has been a desire by both the new leadership of Yemen, as well as the United States, to neutralize the group as much as possible.  On May 6, 2012, an al-Qaida leader linked with the 2000  bombing of the USS Cole died in an air strike  in Yemen. The al-Qaida militant was apparently killed as a result of  missiles fired from a drone.  The details of the death of Fahd al-Quso  were confirmed by tribal leaders in Yemen, the embassy of Yemen in the United States,  as well as al-Qaida. United States officials expressed satisfaction over the elimination of  Fahd al-Quso, noting that the man was a ""senior terrorist operative"" who was  planning further attacks against the United States  and Yemen.  More than a dozen years ago,  al-Qaida militants used a boat laden with explosives to attack the United States warship in the Yemeni port of Aden.

On May 7, 2012, the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) said that it foiled a new ""underwear bomb plot"" by al-Qaida in Yemen.  According to United States authorities, an upgraded version of the failed 2009 ""underwear bomb"" was disrupted and the improvised explosives device (IED) was now in the hands of United States intelligence officials. The bomb plot did not reach the advanced planning stages -- such as selection of a target and the purchase of airplane tickets -- and, accordingly, did not pose a direct threat to the public.  That being said, the very development of the IED  was a clear indication of the intent to carry out a terrorist attack.

A statement released by the Federal Bureau of Investigation read as  follows:  ""As a result of close co-operation with our security and intelligence partners overseas, an improvised explosive device (IED) designed to carry out a terrorist attack has been seized abroad. Initial exploitation indicates that the device is very similar to IEDs that have been used previously by al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) in attempted terrorist attacks, including against aircraft and for targeted assassinations.""

It was soon disclosed that the foiling of the plot involved a double agent who infiltrated an al-Qaida terror cell, volunteered for the suicide mission, but who then delivered the IED to joint United States and international authorities. The double agent -- a British national of Saudi background -- supplied crucial intelligence information to United States and other foreign intelligence agencies, which allowed the CIA to successfully direct a recent drone strike in Yemen that killed Fahd al-Quso -- a senior figure in al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). Al-Quso was linked with the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole in Yemen.

Meanwhile, with the IED in the hands of the CIA, it could now undergo technical and forensic analysis. Of concern was the degree of technological advancement garnered by al-Qaida terrorists as they attempt to evade conventional airport security measures, such as metal detectors and body scans.  The ""custom fit"" device was reportedly difficult to detect in current airport security checks, and is believed to be the work of master bomb-maker and member of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula -- Ibrahim Hassan Tali al-Asiri.

Overall, the operation was  an extraordinary intelligence coup for joint United States, British, and Saudi authorities.  The identity of the double agent/informant has not been disclosed although, according to the New York Times, the British national was recruited by United Kingdom intelligence and has been functioning under the aegis of  Saudi intelligence service, and in close cooperation with the CIA for several years.

Update

On Sept. 11, 2012,  protests erupted in the Egyptian capital city of Cairo with the United States embassy being the main target.  The unrest was sparked by a film of amateur quality, which was produced by a United States citizen, and which some Muslims have determined to be insulting to the Islamic Prophet Muhammad.  The protests soon spread to embassies of Western countries located in various other Muslim countries including Lebanon, Bangladesh, Tunisia, Sudan, Nigeria, as well as the Palestinian territory of Gaza,  while unrest persisted in Egypt and Yemen. German and British embassies were attacked in Tunisia and Sudan; in Lebanon, atleast one person died.  The government of Yemen, like the government of Libya, was quick to express condemnation over the attacks on the United States' embassies. However, there has been concern over the weakness of the new Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi's response, prompting United States President Obama to characterize Egypt as neither an ally nor an enemy, effectively placing relations with post-Nile Revolution Egypt in the category of ""to be determined.""  Egyptian authorities soon stepped up their efforts to repel the protesters in that country.

United States orders closure of embassies in Middle East, Asia, and Africa amidst security worries At the start of August 2013, the Obama administration in the United States ordered the closure of several of its embassies in the Middle East and North Africa  due to threats of a possible  terrorist attack by militant extremists.  At issue were interceptions of messages from the senior leadership of the terror enclave, al-Qaida, indicating that a major terrorist attack was in the works.  The messages involved conversations between  al-Qaida leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, and Nasser al-Wuhayshi, the leader of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, discussing a plan to carry out a major terrorist attack on an embassy. The closures were initially supposed to be enforced for a few days but were extended in many cases for up to a week with the United States authorities noting there was a strong possibility of an al-Qaida inspired attack in the Middle East and North Africa. Meanwhile, the United States Department of State issued a global travel alert, which it said would remain in effect until the end of the month.  Like the embassy closures, the travel alert was also issued due to security concerns.  Explaining the rationale for the travel alert, the United States Department of State said: ""Current information suggests that al-Qaida and affiliated organizations continue to plan terrorist attacks both in the region and beyond, and that they may focus efforts to conduct attacks in the period between now and the end of August."" The travel alert urged American citizens to be vigilant and warned against ""the potential for terrorists to attack public transportation systems and other tourist infrastructure."" Given this guidance, several other Western countries moved to close select diplomatic missions in the region of the Middle East and North Africa, with the United Kingdom  (and the United States) paying particular attention to Yemen.  The United Kingdom Foreign Office was advising British nationals to leave that Middle Eastern country and urging its citizens to avoid travel to Yemen, noting that there was ""a high threat from terrorism throughout Yemen."" Several European countries  also temporarily shut missions in Yemen. The United States had itself withdrawn itsdiplomatic staff from Yemen and urged United States citizens to depart that country amid concerns over security threats.  At issue were emerging concerns that al-Qaida operatives were arriving in the Yemeni capital of Sanaa, and were preparing for a major terror incident that would target both the Yemeni military and international diplomatic interests. Separately,  Yemeni authorities claimed success in foiling an al-Qaida plot to seize two of the country's main ports and blow up oil pipelines.  In the first week of August 2013, Rajeh Badi, a spokesperson for the Yemeni government, said in an interview with international media that the al-Qaida plot involved taking over two ports in the south of the country that are used in exporting Yemeni oil, seizing control of the Canadian-administered al-Dhaba oil terminal, and  killing or kidnapping foreign workers.  The plot also involved plans to bomb and destroy oil pipelines at Balhaf. The entire plot appeared to be driven by revenge for the killing of senior al-Qaida figure, Said al-Shihri, in a drone strike months prior.  According to BBC News, this audacious scheme --  if executed -- would  have been highly dangerous to the security of Yemen as it would have provided al-Qaida -- the notorious terror enclave -- with control over key parts of Yemen's vital infrastructure.  But the attacks, which were intended to take place at the conclusion of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, were seemingly  uncovered with  the assistance of Western and Arab powers.  Despite foiling this plot, Yemen's capital city of Sanaa remained tense with  armored vehicles deployed around the city, and troops and tanks deployed to guard high interest targets, such as government offices, foreign missions, public areas, and the airport.It should be known that both the United States and the United Kingdom withdrew their diplomatic staff from Yemen, and urged their citizens to leave the country, due to a separate security threat.  In that case, intercepted conversations between senior al-Qaida leaders discussing an imminent terrorist attack led to a massive shutdown of United States' diplomatic missions across the Middle East and North Africa. That move was made out of an abundance of caution and appeared to be separate from this plot against the Yemeni ports and pipelines.  Meanwhile, the United States appeared to be stepping up its drone attacks on Yemen with seven suspected Islamic extremist militants reported to have been killed in one strike in the southeastern part of the country.  It was one of several strikes in a two-week period.  Foreign Relations Note: Yemen turns into proxy war between Shi'a Iran and Sunni Saudi Arabia  On March 20, 2015, the notorious and blood-thirsty terror group, Islamic State (also known as Islamic State in the Levant or ISIL), carried out double deadly suicide bombings in the Yemeni capital of Sanaa, killing close to 140 people and injuring 300 others.  The terror group, Islamic State has held sway in large portions of Syria and Iraq and been responsible for some of the most barbaric acts of murder, slavery, abduction and abuse seen in recent history.  While its aim to establish an ultra-hardline  Sunni Islamic caliphate has concentrated on the Syria-Iraq region (known as the Levant), an attack earlier in the week in Tunisia, as well as recently announced alliances with other Islamist terror groups, such as Boko Haram in Nigeria, indicate an emerging global Jihadist agenda.Already, Yemen has been dealing with exactly this threat of global Jihadism from al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) from within its own borders.  But now, with large swaths of Yemen under the control of the Shi'ite Zaidi Houthis, and with the country fracturing, Islamic State was exploiting the power chasm by making Yemen a terror target.  The fact that the suicide bombings ensued in Houthi-controlled Sanaa made clear that Islamic State was deliberately targeting the Shi'ite rebels, whom they consider to be apostates.For their part, the Houthi rebel movement (also known as Zaidis due to their Shi'ite Zaidi beliefs) had been engaged in fierce gun battles with Yemeni armed forces in 2014, ultimately gaining control of the capital of Sanaa and forcing the resignation of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, whose supporters were resisting the Houthis from their base in Yemen's second city of Aden.In the backdrop of these developments was a spate of vicious attacks by the Yemen-based terror group, al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) as they railed against the perceived ascendancy of the Houthis. Angered by the political gains of the Houthis,  the  terror enclave, AQAP commenced a campaign of violence and bloodshed in response. These developments heralded an emerging power struggle between the Houthis and AQAP, with the people of Yemen likely to be the ultimate victims. The main question in the immediate future was if this fight between the Houthis and AQAP would be limited to a power struggle for influence in Yemen where President Hadi was being increasingly sidelined, or if it would metastacize into a civil war.The developments in March 2015, marked by the entrance of Islamic State into the equation, served only to destabilize the Yemeni landscape even further.  The situation was morphing into a geopolitical morass, with the advance of the Iranian-backed Houthis on the second city Aden, the decision by President Hadi to flee the presidential palace, and the commencement of air strikes by Saudi Arabia on Yemen.Meanwhile, with Yemen embroiled in an escalating crisis, and as Western powers moved to distance themselves, regional powers were now signaling their entrance to the Yemeni landscape.  Already, Shi'a Iran was being blamed for backing the Houthis.  But soon Sunni Saudi Arabia was warning that it would intervene into Yemen to act as a countervailing power against Iran.Prince Saud Al Faisal promised to protect Yemen's sovereignty, saying,  ""We are against Iran's intervention in Yemen ... it is actually an act of aggression... We are keen on protecting Yemen's sovereignty, the legitimacy of Yemen represented by President Hadi."" He continued,  ""We are ready to take the necessary measures if needed.""Saudi Arabia's possible intervention was welcomed by the internationally-recognized Hadi government of Yemen.  President Hadi himself had called for the United Nations Security Council to authorize military intervention into Yemen. Also of note was a call by the Yemeni foreign minister, Riyadh Yaseen, for Arab neighbors to assist militarily to stop the advance being made by  Houthi fighters.  He said, ""We have addressed both the [Gulf Cooperation Council] and the U.N. for the need of [imposing] a no-fly zone and banning the use of warplanes at the airports controlled by the Houthis.""  Of course, that intervention was aimed at stemming the advanceof the Houthis and not necessarily at addressing the terror threats posed by al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula or Islamic State.In the early hours of March 26, 2015, following  the news the day before that President Hadi had fled the presidential palace in Aden, Saudi Arabia announced it had commenced air strikes in Yemen.  In fact, Saudi Arabia said its military operation was being conducted in coordination with a coalition of several regional partner countries.  The Saudi effort was aimed at stemming the Houthi tide  and restoring the internationally-recognized ""legitimate"" Hadi government to the helm in Yemen. But with the Houthis -- a Zaidi Shi'ite rebel movement -- being backed by Iran, and with Sunni Saudi Arabia now entering the fray, Yemen was quickly turning into a sectarian and geopolitical proxy war.Note that the United States soon announced that while it was not one of the partner countries carrying out air strikes in Yemen, it was nonetheless providing logistical and intelligence support to the Saudi-led operation in Yemen.After only a few days of air strikes, the Saudi-led regional forces had not yet overpowered the Houthis; however, they were limiting movement of the Shi'ite Zaidi rebellion and were successfully imposing a naval blockade.  As March 2015 was coming to a close, Saudi and Houthi fighters were embroiled in fierce fighting along the Saudi-Yemeni border.Fighting was also taking place in Aden between Houthi fighters and pro-Hadi loyalist forces.At the start of April 2015, despite the air strikes by the Saudi-led coalition, the Houthis were actually making gains on the  southern port city of Aden -- the one time stronghold of President Hadi.  With fighting increasing, a humanitarian crisis emerging, and the death toll increasing (almost 200 people were killed from late March through the first few days of April 2015 alone), several countries began the process of evacuating its citizens from Yemen, while the Red Cross was bringing in humanitarian aid supplies.It should be noted that in an interview with the Arabic television channel al-Arabiya Hadath, Yemeni Foreign Minister Riyadh Yasseen sanctioned the intervention of Arab powers into Yemen, calling for an actual Arab regional force help restore the elected goverment of President Hadi to power in Yemen and save the country from its slippage into chaos.He said, ""Yes, we are asking for that, and as soon as possible, in order to save our infrastructure and save Yemenis under siege in many cities.""Evidence of the Iranian-Saudi proxy war in Yemen was manifest in the second week of April 2015 when Iran called for the formation of a new Yemeni government, and even said it would be willing to offer its assistance in Yemen's political transition.  The statement came at a time when the Iranian-backed Houthis advance on the city of Yemen.  For its part, Saudi Arabia has been involved in air strikes on Yemen, with the intent aim of restoring President Hadi (who had taken refuge in the Saudi capital of Riyadh) to the helm of government.  It was apparent that the two countries were not only a military collision course but also on a parallel political one.Note that on April 14, 2015, the United Nations Security Council imposed an arms embargo on the Iran-backed Houthis. The resolution was overwhelmingly backed by security council members, although Russia abstained from the vote.As the Yemeni conflict escalated, the United States dispatched an aircraft carrier, the USS Theodore Roosevelt, and a guided-missile cruiser, the USS Normandy,  to the maritime waters close to Yemen.  The general consensus was that the presence of the USS Theodore Roosevelt and the USS Normandy was for strategic reasons, and intended to ensure that the United States was positioned to take rapid action if the situation necessitated it.  For its part, the United States  Pentagon said that its presence in the Arabian Sea was not to intercept Iranian arms shipments to Yemen, but rather to  ""ensure the vital shipping lanes in the region remain open and safe.""In a surprise move on April 21, 2015, Saudi Arabia announced that it was ending its bombing campaign against the Houthis. Saudi authorities declared the joint alliance had  achieved the military goals of the operation.  An official statement read as follows: ""Operation Decisive Storm has achieved its goals...(including) removing the threat to Saudi Arabia and neighboring countries, especially in terms of heavy weapons.""  The joint alliance would thus transition its efforts to a new mission called ""Restoring Hope."" The new operation would be aimed at counter-terrorism and security, and would look towards a political resolution in Yemen. Nevertheless, Saudi authorities warned that it reserved the right to go after the Houthis, with Saudi Brigadier General Ahmed Asseri saying, ""The coalition will continue to prevent the Houthi militias from moving or undertaking any operations inside Yemen.""Yemen's internationally-recognized leader, President Hadi, offered his thanks for the Saudi-led regional effort, saying, ""I express the deepest gratitude and respect to our Arab and Muslim brothers and friends in this exceptional strategic alliance in my name and on behalf of the Yemeni people.""While Iran welcomed the end of ""Operation Decisive Storm,"" the fact of the mater was that the fighting continued to plague Yemen, with around 1,000 people dying in the four week period from late March to the third week of April 2015.  Indeed, Houthis and factions loyal to President Hadi continued to engage in battles across the country, while infrastructure was being destroyed, and food and aid supplies were being depleted.  Accordingly,  there was an increasing call for United Nations negotiations to resume, with an eye  on finding a peaceful political solution to the conflict in Yemen.For their part, the Houthis intimated that a diplomatic process was underway, and there was an attempt to forge an agreement that would bring an end to the fighting.  But the Houthis  were unsure whether the Saudi announcement regarding an end to ""Operation Decisive Storm"" was part of that agreement.  Indeed, the news emerged on April 22, 2015 that even though an end to ""Operation Decisive Storm"" was over,  Saudi-led strikes were still taking place in southern Yemen.  It seemed that a mission remained in place to protect the port city of Aden from the Houthis.  Saudi Arabian ambassador Adel al-Jubeir explained the situation, saying, ""When the Houthis or their allies make aggressive moves there will be a response. The decision to calm matters now rests entirely with them.""Meanwhile, Iran was calling for ""urgent humanitarian assistance"" in Yemen, with Iran's foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif stating via the social media outlet Twitter, ""Positive developments in Yemen should be followed by urgent humanitarian assistance, intra-Yemeni dialogue and broad-based govt. Ready to help.""  Iranian President Hassan Rouhani  was meanwhile urging negotiations and a peaceful end to the bloodshed in Yemen, as he said, ""We believe that sustainable peace can prevail if military intervention is ceased and proper conditions are prepared for talks and dialogue among all political groups."" The Houthis themselves were signaling an interest in a return to United Nations-brokered negotiations, along with an end to the Saudis' aerial bombardment campaign.  Via the social media outlet Facebook, the Houthis' spokesperson, Mohammed Abdul-Salam,  declared:  ""We call for -- after the complete cessation of the brutal aggression on Yemen and the total dismantling of the blockade on its people -- the resumption of political dialogue under the auspices of the United Nations.""As April 2015 came to a close, the marine waters surrounding Yemen saw some de-escalation when the aforementioned Iranian flotilla, which was believed to be carrying arms to the Houthis, sailed past Yemen  and to the north.  The general consensus was that the presence of the USS Theodore Roosevelt and the USS Normandy in the area, may have had an effect. However, in a separate incident, Iranian forces fired warning shots and boarded a Marshall Islands-flagged cargo ship, the MV Maersk Tigris,  with a Danish crew in the Strait of Hormuz. The vessel was reported to be following a normal commercial route between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates when the shots were fired, thus spurring the crew to issue a distress call that was picked by by United States forces.  While Iranian authorities downplayed the incident, the United States Pentagon characterized the incident as a provocation.In early May 2015, the hotspot in Yemen continued to be the southern city of Aden where Houthi fighters battled forces loyal to President Hadi, despite continued Saudi-led strikes.  The fighting was quite fierce with more than 120 people killed on May 6, 2015, alone. Among the dead were people trying to flee the violence in a boat that was struck by shelling from Houthi fighters.  The situation in Aden was quite dire with Houthis advancing in the historic district of al-Tawahi -- the location of the presidential palace.Meanwhile, in the north, close to the border with Saudi Arabia, mortar and rocket fire killed five Saudi civilians, prompting retaliatory strikes by Saudi-led forces in that region.By mid-May 2015, Saudi Arabia was reported to be sending a ""strike force"" to its own border zone  with Yemen.  The move came after fierce artilery clashes with Houthi rebels in the area and was intended to reinforce the zone. Also in mid-May 2015, Saudi Arabia was launching air strikes on Sanaa. One strike on a rocket base left 90 people dead and hundreds others injured. It should be noted that these strikes were ensuing weeks after Saudi Arabia announced that it was ending its bombing campaign in Yemen, known as ""Operation Decisive Storm,""  and only days before a fresh ceasefire.It was apparent that despite the intervention of regional forces, and occasional announcements of breakthroughs, the Yemeni landscape continued to be one marked by chaos and turmoil in the spring of 2015.By the start of June 2015, regional coalition forces, led by Saudi Arabia, were striking Houthi targets in Yemen, with scores of people dying as a result.  A significant number of the dead included women and children in their own homes in the rural north of Yemen, close to the border with Saudi Arabia, which has long been the center of the Houthi rebellion.  Strikes were also  taking pace elsewhere in Yemen -- in Sanaa,  at Yemen's naval command  base at the port city of Hodaida on the Red Sea,  at a customs office in the northern province of Haradh, and even in thesouthern city of Aden.Despite the fatal effects of the strikes on Houthi civilians, Saudi Arabia and its allies were resolute in their efforts to stabilize Yemen and return the country to a state of legal governance -- ideally with President Hadi at the helm.  In an interview with Reuters News, Khaled al-Attiyah, the  foreign minister of Qatar, agued that the Saudi-led coalition strikes on the Houthis in Yemen had prevented the rebel movement from completely taking over the country.  He said, ""If there had not been (Operation) Decisive Storm, we would have seen the Houthis and Ali Abdullah Saleh's people all over Yemen.  I think Decisive Storm ... has restored legitimacy in Yemen.""It would seem that Foreign Minister Khaled al-Attiyah's claims held some truth given the Houthis' interest in returning to the negotiating table. Indeed, in the immediate aftermath of this latest spate of strikes, the Houthis were signaling their willingness to participate in United Nations-sponsored peace talks in Switzerland set for June 14, 2015.  Daifallah al-Shami, a member of the Shi'ite Zaidi leadership,  said in an interview with Reuters News  that the Houthi movement  was ready to support ""without preconditions the efforts of the United Nations to organize Yemeni-Yemeni dialogue.""  With rival groups, including those supportive of President Hadi and former President Saleh, also set to attend the peace talks, it seemed there was a genuine opportunity ahead to bring an end to the chaos rocking Yemen. South seccessionist factions, however, would not likely be in attendance and could function as the proverbial ""fly in the ointment.""By mid-June 2015, there were fews signs that United Nations-sponsored talks in Switzerland would produce anything substantial, or that the warring sides were willing to make the hard compromises needed for peace and reconciliation.Of note was the fact that as the talks were convened, the Saudi-led Arab coalition was striking Houthi targets in the Yemeni capital of  Sanaa.  Also of note was the intransigence of the pro-Hadi wing and the Houthis respectively.While  Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed  - the United Nations envoy to Yemen -- cast the talks as an opportunity to end the conflict in Yemen, he nonetheless acknowledged that a massive gulf divided the two sides.  He said,  ""All the parties are still barricaded behind their positions and continue to bet on war rather than a political settlement.""Indeed, there was no reason for either side  to buy into the benefits of peace when  the  facts on the ground were as follows:  1. Despite an aggressive air campaign, the Saudi-led coalition had failed to dislodge the Houthis;  and 2. Any peace agreement would likely be to the detriment of pro-Hadi forces in Yemen. For both sides, war offered a more promising path to power.In July 2015,Saudi authorities announced a ceasefire after air strikes hit a residential area of the Red Sea town of Mokha, killing approximately 120 people and injuring as many as 150 others.  Children were among the casualties, prompting the United Nations, Amnesty International, and Human Rights Watch to respectively warn the Saudi-led coalition that indiscriminate bombardment  of populated areas was a violation of international law.  It was not guaranteed that the Saudi-led coalition would  heed this admonishment; however, the coalition did respond to a call by Yemeni President Hadi  to halt the military activity long enough for humanitarian aid  to be rendered.  To this end, the cessation of the air campaign was to last for five days to allow emergency response teams to offer assistance and to deliver supplies to the victims.Although attention was focused at this time on the ceasefire,  the Saudi-led  coalition targeting the Houthis in Yemen warned that it would, nevertheless, reserve the right to retaliate against any military activity taken by the Houthis.  Of related significance was that the ceasefire did not bring a complete end to hostilities.  Clashes erupted  in the city of Taiz as a result of shelling by  Shi'a Houthis rebels several districts.As well, fighting was reported the the north of the restive port city of Aden and in the provinces of Marib  and Lahj.In September 2015, with the sectarian conflict between  Iranian-backed  Houthis and  the Saudi-backed Hadi government  forces still raging on, the landscape was complicated by the decision by Qatar to deploy 1,000 ground troops to Yemen.  The move came ahead of a massive offensive operation by regional Sunni Arab forces against the Iranian-backed Houthis who continued to hold sway in the Yemeni capital city of Sanaa.  Qatar was already part of the Saudi-led regional operation carrying out air strikes on Houthi-controlled regions of Yemen; however, its decision to deploy ground forces marked a notable shift in a campaign that has been stalled for several months, although some progress was made in driving Houthis and forces allied with former President Salleh from Aden.In the same period, Saudi-led air strikes continued to pound Houthi targets in Yemen.  The air battle  actually increased in strength after a particularly deadly attack  in the first part of September 2015 when a Houthi missile attack killed scores of Gulf Arab troops stationed to the east of Sanaa.  In retaliation, the air strike campaign by Sunni Arab states  on the capital  intensified and  deployments of troops were increased.  These developments came ahead of an offensive operation discussed above, which was being  billed as a ""decisive battle to liberate Sanaa."" Of course, Saudi ground forces were already ""in country"" and carrying out an offensive in the province of Marib, aimed at driving out the Houthis.  The Sanaa offensive was to be understood as a continuation of that operation.Meanwhile, even as plans for a final battle for Sanaa was in the works, the United Nations was planning to broker peace talks on the Yemeni crisis.  But those plans hit a snag in mid-September 2015 when Yemen's  government in exile, headed by President Hadi,  said it would not participate unless the Houthis withdrew from the terrain it captured. Of note was the fact that Hadi and his stalwarts were simply articulating the need to make good on  a provision already enshrined in the prevailing United Nations Resolution 2216.A few days later, Yemen's exiled government modified its stance, saying it would  join the United Nations-sponsored talks, but under the condition that the  Houthis publicly accepted  the terms of the United Nations resolution, which called for them to withdraw from the main cities of Yemen and recognize Hadias the elected president of the country. As noted by Yemeni government spokesperson Rajeh Badi in an interview with Reuters News,  ""If the Houthis are serious about sitting down for negotiations about implementing resolution 2216, they must publicly announce their recognition of this resolution.""In the last week of September 2015, the capital city of Sanaa was the site of bloodshed and violence due to double suicide bombings at a mosque that left at least two dozen people dead and scores more seriously injured.  Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack at the  al-Balili mosque, which ensued just as worshippers were celebrating the Eid al-Adha festival.In the same period of late September 2015, the Red Sea port city of Mocha was struck by tragedy when suspected air strikes hit a wedding party, killing at least 130 people.  The Saudi-led coalition operating in Yemen  and charged with targeting the Houthi rebellion  quickly dismissed any charges of culpability as follows: ""There have been no air operations by the coalition in that area for three days. This is totally false news."" Yet even as  the Saudi-led coalition  denied any responsibility for the incident, there were few other plausible explanations for a fatal air strikes in the area.It was unknown, however, as to whom was actually responsible for the deaths of more than 130 people at a wedding party.  Not surprisingly, the United Nations expressed condemnation for the incident, noting that the air strikes were emblematic of  ""the disregard shown by all sides for human life"" in Yemen.On October 6, 2015, members of the Yemeni government were targeted in a terror attack on the Qasr hotel where they were staying in Aden.  Prime Minister Khaled Bahah and members of his government escaped the double bombing at the hotel unharmed.But a series of attacks at two military installations housing coalition forces from the United Arab Emirates also took place on the same day with different results.  The violence at the military outfits exacted a death toll as 15  pro-government and Saudi-led coalition forces were killed.While initial blame for the spate of attacks fell on the Houthis, the terror group, Islamic State, soon claimed responsibility.  Clearly the Islamist terror group was taking advantage of the power vacuum created as a result of the power struggle between the Saudi-backed government and the Iranian-backed Houthis.Meanwhile, also in late September 2015,  President  Hadi returned from exile in Saudi Arabia to his stronghold in the southern city of Aden.By the start of October 2015, President Hadi's government moved to sever its diplomatic ties with Iran.While there was no detailed explanation offered for the move, the general consensus was that the legitimate government of Yemen objected to Iran's backing of the Houthis, and viewed Iran's actions as overt acts of interference in its sovereign affairs.Of course, as discussed here, the fact remained that several countries, including a Gulf Arab alliance, were now intervening into the affairs of Yemen.By October 2015, there was a glimmer of hope on the turmoil-etched Yemeni landscape as the Houthi rebels finally committed to the United Nations-brokered peace process,  although it was not known if they officially accepted the terms of a prevailing United Nations resolution.In a letter, the Houthi leadership declared: ""We, from our side along with other parties, commit to these seven points as one unified bundle. We welcome the UN call for all sides to return to the table of dialogue.""  At issue was the seven-point Muscat peace plan that was forged in Oman and which stalled for some time, but was now being revived with the Houthis signing on to the deal.Should the Houthis actually move forward by implementing the provisions of the Muscat agreement -- specifically,  enacting a ceasefire, withdrawing  from the cities, and accepting the return of the legitimate government to the capital city of  Sanaa  -- Yemen could well be backing away from the precipice of the crisis that has rocked the country for some time.Note that at the start of November 2015, the United Nations envoy,  Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, said in an interview with Reuters News that he expected negotiations between the rival sides to commence by the middle of the month (November 2015).NOTE:See ""Special Report"" on the 2011 ""Season of Unrest"" gripping Yemen in the ""Political Conditions"" of this Country Review, including the hardline crackdown on anti-government protesters by the Saleh regime,  the end of Saleh's time in power, and the geopolitical repercussions, since then, including the Houthi movement's ascendancy in 2015, and the escalation of a proxy war between Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shi'a Iran on Yemen soil.

U.S. Secretary of State Kerry announces Yemen ceasefire despite objections from government  In November 2016, United States Secretary of State Kerry announced a  ceasefire in Yemen between the Saudi-led coalition and the Houthi rebels despite objections from the Yemeni government of President And Rabbu Mansour Hadi.   The war between the two sides, which has gone on for close to two years, left more than 10,000 people dead and three million displaced.     It was also something of a proxy sectarian and regional battle between the Houthis backed by Shi'a Iran and the pro-wadi forces of the government, backed by Sunni Saudi Arabia.   But precisely because the government forces were backed by the Saudis, it was quite possible that the objections would fall on deaf ears if Saudi Arabia signed onto the ceasefire with the United States.   The agreement at stake built on a previous peace blueprint that went into effect between April and August 2016, and sought to formalize  a cessation of hostilities starting on Nov. 17, 2016.   Provisions of the agreement would require the Houthis to withdraw from cities it captured and controlled since 2014, and would also  require the stabilization of the capital of Saana.  The deal would also facilitate the formation of a national unity government in anticipation of fresh elections.   For his part, Yemeni Foreign Minister Abdel-Malek al-Mekhlafi expressed his government's objections to  Kerry's announcement in an interview with Al Jazeera, saying: ""I believe the current U.S. administration is incapable of providing any guarantees to any party and what Kerry has said is no more than a media bubble at our people's expense.""  Editor's  Note:  Yemen is now on the radar of powerful nation states as an emerging base of radical jihadist Islamists seeking to carry out terror attacks against targets in the West.  From 2009 to the present, Yemen has become a stronghold for Islamic extremists and militants, many of whom belong to the al-Qaida terror enclave, and thus giving rise to the Yemen-based al-Qaida entity known as al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). An attempted terror attack on an airliner on Christmas Day in 2009, as well as a cargo plane terror plot in 2010 led to fears of Yemen going down the road of Afghanistan a decade earlier as the world's new base of Islamic Jihadish terrorism.  As such, the United States has become more involved in Yemen and has been credited with helping Yemeni forces carry out military offensives against major al-Qaida bases in that country, much to the consternation of al-Qaida itself.  That being said, there is no visible American military presence in Yemen, which prefers to achieve its anti-terrorism effort in Yemen using targeted anti-terrorism techniques, including drone strikes and intelligence sharing.  For his part, (now-resigned) President Ali Abdullah Saleh had to establish a delicate balancing act of working with the West to deal with the threat of terrorism from within Yemen's borders, while not alienating the Yemeni citizenry, many of whom sympathize with Islamic extremism.  But in fact, Yemen is the base of both foreign and local al-Qaida fighters.  The local fighters are often aided by relatives, typically as a result of tribal loyalty more than ideology.  However, when these fighters are killed or arrested by government forces, these heavily armed tribes often are emotionally driven to increase support of the militants.  Meanwhile, Yemen has also been home to thousands of Islamic militants who are veterans of several ""holy wars"" in other countries and regions, including Afghanistan, Bosnia and Chechnya.  While most of these Islamic militant veterans are no longer active, they nonetheless maintain their extremist views in keeping with al-Qaida ideology. As noted by Ali Saif Hassan, the manager of a Yemeni group that mediates between the government and opposition: ""It is difficult to draw the line between who is a fundamentalist and who is al-Qaida. It's a spectrum."" As constituents of the country, these elements form part of the broader anti-American and anti-Western base of the country, over which the government has only fragile control.  Meanwhile, the government of Yemen has had to deal with other rebellions and threats to national security, such as the Shi'a Zaidi rebellion, which led to the rise in violent attacks in certain regions of the country since 2004. Known as the Houthis, the Shi'a Zaidi rebels have said they seek greater autonomy. At the core of the Shi'a Zaidi rebellion has been the claim that the government of Yemen is too closely aligned with the United States, which has provided supplies and training to Yemen's security forces under the aegis of the ""war on terror."" The rebels also blame the government for both corruption and discrimination. But Yemen's government has accused the northern Shi'ite rebels, led by Abdul Malik al-Houthi, of trying to oust the democratic government and advancing Shi'a theocratic rule in the country. Indeed, the government has accused the rebels of seeking to re-establish clerical rule that ended with the 1962 Yemeni revolution that yielded the republic. The situation has sometimes spilled over the border into Saudi Arabia and has illuminated the challenges facing the Yemeni government in terms of national security.  Specifically, even as the Yemeni government has had to deal with this rebel threat in the north of the country, there has been another territorial battle against secessionists in the south, as well as the emerging threat posed by al-Qaida terrorists operating from its terrain.  Apart from these political challenges, Yemen is also plagued by an unemployment rate that some estimate is as high as 40 percent, chronic poverty, increased food prices, high levels of illiteracy, and malnutrition. In these ways, Yemen's political, economic and human development challenges are illustrative of complicated terrain that is ripe for further exploitation by extremist, militant, and terrorist elements.  It was hoped that the election of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi  in 2012 would shift Yemen onto more positive footing.  The developments in 2014 with the Houthi Zaidi rebels grabbing control over Sanaa, coupled with the intensified campaign of aggression from rival al-Qaida terrorists, presented a genuine challenge to President Hadi and the government of Yemen.  That challenged morphed into a security crisis at the start of 2015 as the Houth Zaidi movement attempted to topple the government of Yemen.   Of course, in the backdrop of effort was the continuing threat posed by al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, which was carrying out attacks in Yemen in a bid to wrest influence away from the Houthis. The fresh threat posed by Islamic State against the Houthis in March 2015, manifest in a destructive attack on Sanaa, made the dire security situation significantly worse. The situation was morphing into a geopolitical morass, with the advance of the Iranian-backed Houthis on the second city Aden, the decision by President Hadi to flee the country, and the commencement of air strikes by Saudi Arabia on Yemen.  Indeed,  Yemen in recent years was the site of a dangerous power struggle between these various players and disparate factions, and headed by weakened leadership, which was made distinctly worse by the exit of President Hadi.  Yemen was thus alarmingly close to slipping off the proverbial cliff into the abyss of being a failed state.  Note that the return of Hadi in late 2015 did not significantly changing the dire state of the landscape.  It was to be seen if  the existence of a peace deal as of 2016 would present the opportunity for stabilization.

INDIANA - Ever since the overthrow of Mohammad Mosaddegh, the democratically elected prime minister of Iran in 1953, Iran has been under pressure by the United States and its allies.

From the Iran-Iraq war that lasted for eight years, in which Iran fought all on its own, to economic sanctions that have been ongoing for decades, cruelty towards the biggest country in the Middle East has been apparent.

On Tuesday, May 8th, 2018, Donald Trump, the U.S. president, withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal, which has limited the Iranian government from creating enriched uranium, a major substance in making nuclear bombs, in return of removing the sanctions.

The deal was negotiated between France, Germany, Britain, Russia, China, Iran, and Obama, the previous president of the United States. The deal was made possible by the hard work of all the countries mentioned. The aim was to curtail war.

The truth is that the United States and its allies are afraid of Iran getting too powerful. But all the countries trying to stop Iran from having a nuclear program, have nuclear programs themselves. Iran has been threatened and attacked before by these countries for having a defense mechanism that is its right. Denying Iran a nuclear program is simply discriminatory and shows the hypocrisy behind the P5+1. But still Iran agreed to the deal, because the sanctions had put too much pressure on Iranian civilians. People in Iran can hardly buy basic necessities. The economy is at its worse, and America is to blame.

Now what is interesting and more messed up about this whole situation, is that a similar thing happened to Iraq years ago. When Iraq was trying to develop its nuclear program, the same countries got involved, tried to make a deal, and then the Israeli government claimed that Iraq was cheating and not following the rules of the deal. War broke out and the country hasn't been the same since. Israel is sticking its nose in this time just as it did years ago with Iraq.

Will the same thing that happened to Iraq also happen to Iran? Maybe.

Iranian government has stuck to the deal so far so as all the countries involved in the deal except for the U.S.

Iran, just like any other country in the world, has the right to grow and help Iranians reach prosperity.

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: And on June 12th in Singapore I'll be meeting with Kim Jong-un.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN ANCHOR: The summit is set. President Trump will meet with Kim Jong-un next month. Can the president get Kim Jong-un to denuclearize?

BRIGGS: And Iran now condemning the Israeli strikes inside Syria. Those strikes followed rockets launched into Israel from the north. We're live in Jerusalem with what all this means for the volatile region.

Welcome back, everyone, to EARLY START on a Friday. I'm Dave Briggs.

ROMANS: It is Friday. I'm Christine Romans. It's 31 minutes past the hour. A lot to get to today. We're going to get to all those stories in a moment. But let's begin with this breaking news happening right now.

A federal investigation under way after a Texas church is damaged by a package bomb. It is the second explosive device to target the city in two weeks. A Beaumont police officer called to the St. Stephen's Episcopal Church Thursday. Found what looked to be an already exploded package. It caused minor damage to the church.

BRIGGS: The FBI along with the ATF are assisting local police. The director of the church Reverend Steven Balke saying, ""We are very blessed no one was injured,"" adding, ""It has made everyone very nervous."" Two weeks ago, a suspicious package was found at a Starbucks in the city. It was later found to be an explosive device as well. Beaumont is about 250 miles east of Austin where, as you remember, a serial bomber targeted homes and businesses in March.

ROMANS: All right. Senator John McCain's opposition to Gina Haspel becoming CIA director met with a despicable response from inside the White House. An official tell CNN that at a meeting staffer Kelly Sadler said of McCain, quote, ""He's dying anyway."" The Arizona senator of course is battling brain cancer. The official says Sadler meant it as a joke. But the official says the joke fell flat. Sadler runs surrogate communications at the White House.

BRIGGS: Asked for a response, the White House said, quote, ""We respect Senator McCain's service to our nation and he and his family are in our prayers during this difficult time."" A source says Sadler called the senator's daughter Meghan McCain to apologize. It is unclear how McCain responded. The senator's wife, Cindy McCain, posted this tweet, quote, ""May I remind you my husband has a family, seven children and five grandchildren.""

ROMANS: John McCain on Wednesday urged his fellow senators to reject Gina Haspel for CIA director after she declined to say torture is immoral. McCain's move prompted this ugly response from FOX Business commentator, retired Air Force Lieutenant General Thomas McInerney.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS HOST: John McCain has said he's not going to endorse Haspel also, in part because she believes in torture. That she thinks it works.

LT. GEN. THOMAS MCINERNEY (RETIRED), FOX BUSINESS COMMENTATOR: John McCain. It worked on John. That's why they call him ""Songbird John.""

(END VIDEO CLIP)

ROMANS: OK. That's just absolutely not true. Politifact calls that pants on fire. That's just a weird conspiracy theory. No evidence that torture ever got McCain to betray his country. The man is a national hero. Host Charles Payne later tweeted an apology to McCain saying he missed the remark in the moment, he would have challenged it had he heard it.

BRIGGS: Yes. This is not on Charles Payne. A spokesman for FOX tells CNN that General McInerney will no longer be invited on FOX Business or FOX News. Meghan McCain will address the remarks from McInerney and Sadler on ""The View"" today.

On a more positive note, Senator Lindsey Graham visited McCain this week in Arizona. He says McCain is getting stronger.

ROMANS: It's just -- there should be no room for that garbage.

BRIGGS: Well, McCain denied early release in solidarity for the other prisoners of war. That's what we should remember.

ROMANS: It's just -- it's really frustrating.

All right, 34 minutes past hour. DHS is flatly denying a ""New York Times"" report Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen considered resigning after an explosive argument with President Trump during a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday. A source with knowledge of the incident says the president erupted over immigration, berating Nielsen in front of all those other people not doing enough to secure the border. The secretary, we're told, standing her ground citing the law to the president more than once.

[04:35:06] BRIGGS: According to the ""Times,"" Nielsen later drafted a resignation letter but a Homeland Security spokesman denies she threatened to step down. And Nielsen says she shares the president's frustration with border security blaming the problem partly on congressional inaction.

ROMANS: John Kelly admits being White House chief of staff has been trying at times, but says he has never seriously considered leaving. In an NPR interview airing this morning, Kelly says, ""There is times of great frustration mostly because of the stories I read about myself or others that I think the world of which is just about everybody who works at the complex and wonder whether it's worth it to be subjected to that.""

BRIGGS: Kelly says his only regret in taking the job is what -- that he wasn't there from day one. He says the White House was less organized than the president deserved for the first six months. Kelly also acknowledged that the Russia investigation is hard on his boss, saying, quote, ""It may not be a cloud, but certainly the president is, you know, somewhat embarrassed, frankly. When world leaders come in, you walk in and you know the first couple of minutes of every conversation might evolve around that kind of thing.""

ROMANS: All right. Republicans outside the White House are also growing weary of the Russia investigation. Take a look at this brand new CNN poll. Only 17 percent approve of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's handling of the probe. That is down 12 points since March. 64 percent of Democrats still approve. But also down five points.

BRIGGS: Republicans also turning on the idea the president testifying under oath. 39 percent say he should not. Down 15 points since March. Democrats holding firm 93 percent saying he should. On Thursday, Vice President Pence urged Mueller to wrap up his investigation in the interest of the country.

ROMANS: The location and date are now set for President Trump's summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un. For the latest let's turn it over to CNN's Paula Hancocks. She is in Seoul.

Paula, why Singapore?

PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Christine, there are a number of reasons. For the U.S. officials the main reason was neutrality. They wanted a location which was completely neutral for the United States and for Donald Trump to go.

Now the United States had been looking at the DMZ. He had been tweeting about it certainly after the North-South Korean summit which was incredibly picturesque, and the optics were very strong. But U.S. officials thought that that would showing a conciliatory gesture towards Kim Jong-un to be turning up at his doorstep. So the reason for Singapore is it is a close ally of the United States. North Korea has no objections as far as we know because there is an embassy in Singapore as well.

So a very neutral location for this extremely historic summit between the first sitting U.S. president and the North Korean leader. And you can hear from the rhetoric from both sides just how far we have come in the very short amount of time. The fact that the U.S. president is praising Kim Jong-un for having released those detainees, saying it was very nice, saying it was a pleasant surprise.

And even from North Korean state-run media when we're hearing about Kim Jong-un meeting with the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. It is very warm terms that we are hearing so really quite dramatic how quickly we have come in a very short amount of time -- Christine.

ROMANS: Yes, I mean, they were fire and fury and dotard not very long ago and now here we are, the two men are going to meet so remarkable.

All right, thank you so much for that, Paula, in Seoul.

To money now. Net neutrality will officially end next month. The FCC set the date June 11th repealing what FCC chair Ajit Pai called the unnecessary and harmful Internet regulations introduced during the Obama administration. The FCC voted to repeal them in December. The Obama era rules were designed to ensure free and open Internet preventing providers from blocking or slowing down access or charging consumers more for certain content.

Tech companies like Facebook and Apple oppose the revised rules, but they are a win for Internet providers who say the strict regulations stifled investment. They pledge not to block access after the rules expire. But many advocates are really concerned here. More than 20 states have filed a lawsuit to stop the repeal. Senate Democrats are pushing for a vote on a bill to overturn the decision as soon as next week.

BRIGGS: All right, ahead, 10-ton boulders flying as far as half a mile. Rain laced with toxins.

[04:40:03] Some serious warnings about what could be on the horizon with the Kilauea Volcano in Hawaii.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: Among the many brave national security blunders of the previous administration, one of the world's worst was the disastrous Iran nuclear deal. We're putting the harshest, strongest, most stringent sanctions on Iran.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BRIGGS: The president says he's hopeful a better deal can be negotiated with the Iranians. It's 24 hours but Iran is now condemning Israel's strikes on Syria launched in retaliation for rockets from Iranians in Syria. Israel claims it destroyed nearly all of Iran's military capabilities in Syria. No escalation in the violence overnight, but the situation remains volatile.

[04:45:03] International diplomatic editor Nic Robertson has some context for us live from Jerusalem.

Good morning, Nic.

NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: Yes. Good morning, Dave. I think what people are trying to figure out at the moment is has Iran ended its strategic restraint. You know, Israel had targeted it a number of times. Iranian military facilities inside Syria. A number of Iranian operatives have been killed. Iran had done nothing to try to strike back at Israel.

After President Trump pulled out of the JCPOA, the timing here seems to be that Iran has struck back. So have they stopped that strategic restraint? It's a very important question. Right now in Tehran, the president there a moderate Rouhani has told the Europeans if he's going to be able to sell that Iran should stay with the JCPOA and if that moderate should win out over the hardliners, he has -- the Europeans have a very short timeframe to prove that that can work.

And we just heard from President Trump there right now very stringent sanctions, most European diplomats don't think that they will be able to deliver on the JCPOA because the sanctions will likely affect them and their companies doing business inside Iran. So you're left in a position where the hardliners in Iran and they're the ones who -- they're the ones who are controlling the forces on the ground in Syria are going to be saying well, the moderates got it all wrong. We should take the lead.

That leaves a much greater likelihood of an increase in violence. Russia at the moment doesn't want to see that. It can't afford a wider war inside Syria because itself is under tough U.S. and European sanctions. But the reality is if the JCPOA goes down and the moderates in Iran can't succeed, then the possibility of violence is much, much higher between Israel and Iran.

BRIGGS: But no violence this morning. Nic Robertson in Jerusalem for us this morning. Thank you.

ROMANS: In the wake of President Trump's decision to quit the Iran deal, former president George W. Bush is warning about the dangers of isolation. Accepting an award from a foreign policy think tank, Bush invoked the words of Winston Churchill.

GEORGE W. BUSH, 43RD PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The price of greatness is responsibilities. One cannot rise to be in many ways the leading community in the civilized world without being involved in its problems. Without being convulsed by its agonies. And inspired by its causes. If this had been proved in the past as it had been, it will become indisputable in the future. People in the United States cannot escape world responsibility. I wholeheartedly agree.

ROMANS: The former president also thanked everyone for their prayers after the death of his mother. He says his dad, George H.W. Bush, misses mom but his health is good.

We're glad of that.

BRIGGS: You said it was a bit of a Bush-ism there. A bit of a --

ROMANS: Well, because he said the price of greatness is responsibility. I giggled a little bit. Because it's responsibility. And that made me remember how much we all love --

BRIGGS: But he gets to the heart of the Churchill quote.

ROMANS: Yes, he did. It's the heart of Churchill quote.

BRIGGS: OK. In the catalog of bad, awful ceremonial first pitches at a Major League Baseball game, I think we have a new winner. A former NFL player and the host of ""American Ninja Warrior"" tried and, well, epic fail coming up next.

[04:53:06] ROMANS: A U.S. military investigation finds multiple failures led to that Ocotber ambush that killed four American soldiers in Niger. Key findings in the Pentagon's report show the soldiers were conducting an unapproved high risk mission yet still did not run battle drills with their Nigerian partner force.

CNN's Ryan Browne is at the Pentagon with more on what changes are in store.

RYAN BROWNE, CNN PENTAGON REPORTER: Good morning, Dave and Christine. The U.S. military released yesterday its summary of its months-long investigation into the October 4th ambush that left four U.S. soldiers dead in a remote area in Niger in Africa. While officials say that the mission never meant to encounter the enemy, but they were ambushed by ISIS fighters. Some 100 we're being told. Being outnumbered and outgunned, the team became separated with three U.S. soldiers dying in a firefight separated from the rest of their group.

Now Sergeant La David Johnson whose body was missing for 48 hours was forced to run one kilometer, running for his life from ISIS terrorists before he too was killed. We're told that none of the U.S. soldiers were ever taken alive in enemy hands. But the investigation has pointed out numerous failures with regard to planning and training for U.S. forces in Niger.

Now the investigation calls on things to be improved, says that training practices need to be improved, planning processes with how missions are approved needs to be improved but also new equipment will be made available to U.S. forces in places like Niger. Armored vehicles, increased fire power and additional surveillance. Things that may have helped avert this ambush.

Back to you, guys.

BRIGGS: Some positive can come of that situation.

Meanwhile, no volcanic activity tonight at the Kilauea Volcano in Hawaii. Just about 11:00 there. But scientists are renewing dire warnings about the threat of explosive, almost biblical eruptions.

[04:55:02] ROMANS: They say the violent eruptions could fling 10-ton boulders as far as a half a mile and sent columns of choking ash miles into the sky. The last time that happened was nearly a century ago.

BRIGGS: Which prompted Hawaii's Volcanoes National Park to close indefinitely. Toxic gasses released from the Kilauea eruption also raising concerns about acid rain and volcanic smog which can induce asthma attacks and other respiratory problems.

ROMANS: At 104 years old, renowned Australian scientist David Goodall ended his life at an assisted suicide clinic in Switzerland. His grandson and longtime nurse were at his side. He died listening to Beethoven's ""Ode to Joy."" Before Goodall left his home in Australia for the Swiss clinic, he told CNN he wanted to die on his terms. The grandfather of 12 said life stopped being enjoyable five or 10 years ago when his mobility and eyesight failed.

ROMANS: Goodall says he hoped his story would lead to assisted suicide being legalized in other countries. BRIGGS: All right. What you're about to witness could be the worst ceremonial first pitch ever thrown at a baseball game. Former NFL linebacker and co-host of ""American Ninja Warrior"" Akbar Gbaja-Biamila before the Phillies game last night. He is a lefty and a former NFL star, we mind you. And he just spiked the baseball. He said he thought it would be like throwing a football. I don't know why.

But he did have fun with it, Romans.

ROMANS: Yes.

BRIGGS: He did laugh about it afterwards. And you got to take that in stride. But he goes down in the hall of fame with 50 Cent.

ROMANS: So is it the worst? Is that the worst?

BRIGGS: I think this is worse than 50 Cent. We'll show you that later and you can decide which is the worst of all time.

ROMANS: All right. Let's get a check on ""CNN Money"" this morning. Global stocks mixed right now after Wall Street closed higher. New data showed inflation rose slower than expected in April. That eases fears of faster interest hikes this year. Apple, wow, hit a record high inching closer to being the first company worth $1 trillion. Apple's market value right now $958 billion.

When will Ford run out of F-150s? It only has an 84-day supply of its best-selling truck. Ford halted production after a fire at supply facility caused it to run out of parts. It has no idea when it can resume. Now Ford says that will hurt its bottom line this quarter. The F-150 accounts for a third of Ford's sale. The F-150 has been the top selling U.S. vehicle by any manufacturer for more than 40 years.

Is $100 oil on its way back? Bank of America says world oil prices could hit $100 per barrel next year. U.S. oil? $94. That's because new Iran sanctions could cut off some exports just as the major oil producing nations are slowing production to nudge prices higher. And as oil prices climb, you pay more at the pump. Gas prices are up 21 percent over the past year and rising. A typical family can expect to spend $200 more on gas this summer. And that higher gas will cut into the extra cash in your pocket that you have because of the new tax bill.

Morgan Stanley says Americans will pay $38 billion more to fill up their tanks this year. That wipes out about a third of the direct savings from tax cuts.

BRIGGS: You wonder, if like everything else, that becomes a midterm political issue.

",543184,"Iranian forces based in Syria fired 20 rockets at Israeli front- line military positions in the Golan Heights early yesterday, the Israeli military said, triggering an Israeli reprisal and further escalating heightened tensions.

The Israeli military said its Iron Dome rocket defence system intercepted some of the incoming projectiles, while others caused only minimal damage. There were no Israeli casualties.

Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus, a military spokesman, said Iran's Al Quds force fired the rockets at several Israeli bases, though he would not say how Israel determined the Iranian involvement. The incoming attack set off air raid sirens in the Israeli-controlled Golan, which was captured from Syria in the 1967 war.

Israel ""views this Iranian attack very severely,"" Conricus told reporters. He said Israel had responded, but did not provide details.

""This event is not over,"" he said.

Syria's state media said Syrian air defences had intercepted ""hostile Israeli missiles"" early yesterday that were fired over southwestern Damascus. Hours later, state-run Al-Ikhbariya TV broadcast a live feed of Syrian air defences firing into the sky above the capital.

Syrian media earlier said the hostilities began with Israeli fire at Syrian positions in southern Syria from across the border. Pro- Syrian media said Syrian missiles then fired at Israeli forces. One TV station, Beirut- based Al-Mayadeen, said at least 50 missiles were fired from Syria at Israeli forces in the Golan Heights. Al-Ikhbariya TV said missiles targeted 10 Israeli positions. Syrian media said it was the first time in years that Syrians had fired at Israeli forces in the Golan Heights.

Israel has been on heightened alert in recent days, anticipating an Iranian attack following Iranian vows to retaliate to what it says are recent Israeli strikes in Syria targeting Iranian outposts.

Late Tuesday, Syrian state media said Israel struck a military outpost near the capital of Damascus. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the missiles targeted depots and rocket launchers that likely belonged to Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard, killing at least 15 people, eight of them Iranians.

Last month, an attack on Syria's T4 air base killed seven Iranian military personnel.

",1008438,"WASHINGTON (CNN) --  The Pentagon, in conjunction with the State Department, has increased the presence of Marine Corps security forces at a number of US embassies in the Middle East and Africa in light of increased tensions and unrest following the US decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal and the opening of the new US embassy in Jerusalem, according to several military officials. 

CNN first reported the deployment of Marines on Friday.

The Marine Corps publicly acknowledged the deployment in a statement saying it had ""been requested to augment a number of embassies in light of current events."" 

The Defense Department is not disclosing the number of Marines being deployed or their locations although it's been known for weeks that security has been increased at US diplomatic installations in Israel including the new embassy in Jerusalem. 

""DOD takes necessary steps to mitigate threats to U.S. personnel, embassies and consulates around the world. At the request of the Department of State, and in coordination with host nations, the Department of Defense has deployed additional Marine Security Guards to several U.S. embassies for the purpose of temporarily augmenting security,"" Pentagon spokeswoman Lt. Cmdr. Rebecca Rebarich told CNN.

Escalating violence in the Gaza strip area has also led to increased concern it could spark demonstrations in other locations.

The Marines are being sent from a unit called the Marine Security Guard Security Augmentation unit which has advanced training beyond the routine Marine Corps embassy guard who protect installations inside their fence perimeter. 

The additional Marines ""are uniquely postured to respond expeditiously,"" the Marine Corps statement said. 

Several US officials have told CNN that US embassies throughout the Middle East and Muslim countries are on alert because of three key events: the US embassy opening in Jerusalem on Monday, the beginning of Ramadan and the Nakba anniversary for Palestinians. 

Palestinians mark what they call the ""Nakba"" or Catastrophe, in memory of the more than 700,000 Palestinians who were either driven from, or fled, their homes during the Arab-Israeli war that accompanied the creation of the State of Israel in 1948.

The officials said there have been recent requests last week by the State Department for additional US Marines for additional protection at several embassies.

Officials said that there does not appear to be a specific terror threat, but rather the US will be watching for signs of additional destabilizing and escalatory Iranian military actions or surrogate operations through Hezbollah. 

US defense officials also told CNN that Marines in the Middle East have been earmarked as a rapid response force if tensions rise given the upcoming dates on the calendar of concern. 

For weeks, the State Department has been working to bolster security at US diplomatic posts around the Muslim world in advance of the US embassy move in Jerusalem, anticipating possible violence.

",684083,"Yemen's official Saba news agency, citing an unnamed military official, said that the short-range Badr-1 ballistic missile was launched on Friday evening against the al-Darb military camp, adding that the projectile had hit the designated target in the region with great precision.

There were no immediate reports on the number of possible causalities and the extent of damage caused.

Saudi sources, however, claimed to have intercepted the incoming Yemeni missile, Presstv reported.

Saudi Arabia often claims that it intercepts incoming Yemeni missiles, but a close study of evidence by The New York Times last year clearly suggested that in one of the most high-profile of such Yemeni missile attacks, the projectile, launched deep into Saudi territory, had in fact landed unimpeded, bypassing American-made Patriot missiles and potentially other defenses used by Riyadh. Saudi Arabia claimed that it had foiled that attack, which targeted the Riyadh airport.

Saudi Arabia and its allies launched the war on Yemen in March 2015 in support of the country's former Riyadh-friendly government. The Yemeni Ministry of Human Rights announced in a statement on March 25 that the Saudi-led war had left 600,000 civilians dead and injured until then.

In one of the deadliest air raids, Saudi warplanes last month targeted a wedding ceremony in Hajjah several times, killing almost 50 people and wounding 55 others. Saudi jets also carried out raids on the ambulances transporting the casualties to local hospitals.

The Saudi-led countries engaged in the war on Yemen have also blockaded the already-impoverished country.

More than 30 boys were also injured in the aerial bombardment, which was carried out by a Saudi-led international coalition that has backed Yemen President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi against Houthi opposition forces for more than three years.UN Secretary-General António Guterres strongly condemned the attack on Thursday, urging an ""independent and prompt investigation"", adding that warring parties must take ""constant care to spare civilians"".The UN Special Envoy for Yemen, Martin Griffiths, said that he was ""deeply shocked by the appalling tragedy that claimed so many innocent lives"". The UN official has invited the warring parties to Geneva on 6 September in a bid to reach a political solution to the conflict - the first such discussions since 2016.""This should urge us all to exert more efforts to end the conflict through an inclusive intra-Yemeni dialogue,"" he added, stressing that he hoped all of those involved in the fighting across the country will ""engage constructively in the political process, including consultations scheduled in Geneva in September.""Briefing journalists in Geneva on Friday, UNICEF spokesperson Christophe Boulierac said that the agency believed the air strike on the school bus constituted ""the single worst attack"" on children since 2015. ""No such number of children have been involved in one incident before,"" he added.

""On 19 July, there were four children killed when a coalition air strike struck a farm. On 30 July, two children were killed when an air strike hit a motorbike.

Among the dead were six children and four women, Ms. Throssell said, noting that mortars had struck different built-up locations in Al Hawak district.These included the fishing port, a dock and hangar ""at the time full of fishermen and street vendors"", the OHCHR spokesperson explained, adding that Al-Thawra hospital was hit shortly afterwards.

",1190220,"Taliban fighters armed with captured weapons and night vision goggles have flooded into the capital of Afghanistan's western Farah province, forcing the governor to flee and driving security forces and officials into a handful of besieged compounds.

Insurgents launched their attack on Farah city, near the Iranian border, around 2am, city residents said. Within hours they were within a few hundred metres of police and intelligence headquarters and had set up checkpoints on roads in and out of city, local officials said.

""Fighting is currently ongoing inside the city and we do not know about the condition of civilians,"" said Dadullah Qane, a provincial council member for Farah, who said insurgents were trying to spring fellow militants from the provincial jail. ""They are trying to break into the prison.""

Another senior official who asked to remain anonymous said the provincial governor had fled soon after the attack began.

Farah province is a key drug trafficking corridor that borders Iran and the opium-growing heartlands of Helmand. Hundreds of fighters based in Farah, Helmand and neighbouring Nimroz joined together to launch Tuesday's attack. 

The Taliban last month announced the start of its annual spring offensive - fighting ebbs and flows with the seasons in Afghanistan's long war - by formally renouncing government calls for peace talks.

By late afternoon on Tuesday communications with the city had been cut. Afghan security forces said they were rushing reinforcements to Farah city, which Nato claimed was still under government control. A spokesman tweeted a photo of an A-10 fighter plane ""on the offensive against the Taliban"".

#Farah city remains under govt. control. #ANDSF, supported by @USFOR_A#airpower, including @usairforce A-10s like one pictured, are on offensive against Taliban. @MoDAfghanistan has stated Afghan security forces are bringing their full capabilities to bear. #AFGStrong#ForAFGpic.twitter.com/LaM12izx6D - Resolute Support (@ResoluteSupport) May 15, 2018

The Guardian tried to contact nearly a dozen local security officials to verify the situation on the ground but was unable to reach any of them. 

However, videos tweeted by Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid showed Taliban insurgents walking freely through Farah, including one area that residents identified as ""Provincial Square"", at the heart of the city.

Desperate civilians who fled the fighting, terrified both of Taliban violence and being caught up in counter-attacks by government forces, were stranded in the desert around nine miles (15km) outside the town. 

""My family and Farah residents including women and children are here with no water and food. There is nothing,"" said Abdulqader Karimi. ""People here are sitting in their cars and those who do not have cars are here under intense sun."" 

""[Everyone] left their properties behind. We could only save our lives by fleeing ... the government is not telling us anything.""

Despite a Taliban promise not to kill or loot if civilians ""remain in your homes and pray"", at least one resident said fighters had killed elders and Farah civilians with ties to the government and security forces. He saw bodies in the street as he fled, and family members weeping over their dead.

Farah residents who did stay in the city said they also worried about being caught up in fighting or being hit by airstrikes.

""Most people left the city before dawn. But some including me and my family are trapped. We want to leave but it's so dangerous,"" said one resident, who asked to give only his first name Rohulla. ""As I'm talking to you, I can hear heavy gunfire.""

Tuesday's attack is the first assault on a provincial capital this year, but analysts and politicians say the city should have been better defended, after three similar attacks by insurgents last year. 

Insurgents have regularly tried to take provincial capitals, in attacks that serve both as a show of strength, and a chance to gather weapons and equipment.

In 2015 the insurgents briefly seized control of Kunduz, the fifth largest city in Afghanistan. The militants were ousted with days, but it was the first time the group had controlled a provincial capital since they were toppled from power in 2001, and a major shock to the government and its backers.

In subsequent years insurgents fought their way back into the heart of Kunduz and Lashkar Gah, capital of neighbouring Helmand province, but never fully displaced Afghan government forces.",16,has stated Afghan security forces are bringing their full capabilities to bear.,0.5262821316719055,4.197620868682861,2
"Will ACLED record any civilian fatalities in Iran in August 2018?
",167501,"Aug 06, 2018( Western Free Press: http://www.westernfreepress.com/Delivered by Newstex)  The first round of U.S. sanctions on Iran go into effect Tuesday, with another, more stinging round set to hit in November reimposing restrictions that were lifted under the Obama administration-led nuclear deal with the Islamist regime. President Donald Trump signed an executive order reimposing the sanctions Monday at his home in Bedminster, New Jersey, where he is vacationing. In May, Trump pulled the United States out of the multilateral Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, reached in 2015. The president last week said he was willing to meet[1] with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani without preconditions to negotiate a new nuclear agreement. 'As we continue applying maximum economic pressure on the Iranian regime, I remain open to reaching a more comprehensive deal that addresses the full range of the regime's malign activities, including its ballistic-missile program and its support for terrorism,' Trump said in a statement announcing the sanctions. 

'The United States welcomes the partnership of like-minded nations in these efforts.' This won't be easy for Iran or the regime, said Richard Goldberg, senior adviser to the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington think tank. 'In the weeks ahead, the Iranian regime will come under enormous financial and political stress, with the people of Iran continuing to demand a government that invests in jobs and higher incomes, rather than terrorism and proxy wars,' Goldberg told The Daily Signal. After the November sanctions on energy and Iran's central bank, Goldberg said, 'the mullahs will have to choose between fundamental behavioral change and regime collapse.' 'We can expect to see strong support for U.S. sanctions from our allies in the Middle East, compliance from our Asian allies, and reluctant compliance from European banks and insurers,' Goldberg added. 'China is the biggest wild card, but it's unlikely the party leaders in Beijing want to risk the economic consequences that would come with knowingly violating U.S. sanctions.' As part of withdrawing from the nuclear deal, the Trump administration determined it would impose one set of sanctions in August and another set in November on energy and banking, based on a 90-day and 180-day wind-down period. The second set are made up of the primary international sanctions on Iran that existed before the Obama nuclear deal. Effective 12:01 a.m. Tuesday, sanctions will be reimposed on the purchase of U.S. bank notes by the government of Iran; on Iran's trade in gold and other precious metals; on graphite, aluminum, steel, coal, and software used in industrial processes; on transactions related to the Iranian currency, the rial; on activities relating to Tehran's issuance of sovereign debt; and on Iran's automotive sector. As of Nov. 5, remaining sanctions go into effect on Iranian oil transportation, energy development, shipbuilding sectors, and the central bank of Iran. These could increase oil prices in the United States. The sanctions could bring a significant political shift in Iran long term, said Christopher Garcia, a former deputy director at the Commerce Department, who dealt with international economic development. 'In the short term, Iran will try to patch things up through Russia and China financing,' Garcia told The Daily Signal. 'In the long term, there is a very high possibility that the highly educated people in Iran facing economic hardship will be increasingly upset with the regime.' 'The goal is to change the Iranian government's behavior, but if regime change is the consequence, we would not object to that,' he said. In his formal statement, Trump said:The [Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action] a horrible, one-sided deal failed to achieve the fundamental objective of blocking all paths to an Iranian nuclear bomb, and it threw a lifeline of cash to a murderous dictatorship that has continued to spread bloodshed, violence, and chaos. Since the deal was reached, Iran's aggression has only increased. The regime has used the windfall of newly accessible funds it received under the JCPOA to build nuclear-capable missiles, fund terrorism, and fuel conflict across the Middle East and beyond.Since the president announced his decision May 8 to withdraw from the deal, the administration has sanctioned 38 Iran-related targets in six separate actions, according to the White House. 'We are already seeing some of the Iranian people voting with their pocketbook by moving money out of the currency, the rial, as it's plummeting to the lowest point in history,' Jim Phillips, senior research fellow for Middle Eastern affairs at The Heritage Foundation, told The Daily Signal. Iran will have a more difficult time funding the Syrian government of dictator Bashar Assad and funding the Houthi rebels[2] in Yemen, Phillips said, but he doubts the Iranian government is likely to accept Trump's offer for a meeting anytime soon. 'Knowing Iranians, they will wait until 2020 to see if there is a new president,' Phillips said. Despite widespread dissatisfaction among the Iranian people, he said, the opposition isn't unified enough for an uprising against the regime. Governments of Europe have tried to enact policies to reduce the impact of the U.S. sanctions on Iran, but European companies are exiting Iran to avoid any U.S. sanctions on their business transactions. Last month, an Iranian diplomat was charged in a bomb plot[3] in Paris, which will make Europe less likely to condemn the sanctions, Phillips said. 'I don't think Europeans are eager to stick their necks too far out for Iran,' he said. 'It's only a matter of time before Iran is caught in another terrorist incident. It is a harder country to defend amid terrorism abroad and human rights abuses in their own country.'

"Will ACLED record any civilian fatalities in Iran in August 2018?
",31703,"The US nuclear sanctions as currently structured do not kick in for 90 days. That gives time to negotiate and salvage the situation.

Is the Iranian nuclear deal alive, wounded or dead?

As with many actions by President Donald Trump, the full answer will not be clear until some time passes. But overall the deal is a lot closer to being dead than either alive or wounded.

What about Trump's speech puts the deal on its deathbed, what leaves an opening for it to survive, and how did we get here?

The narrative kept shifting recently.

Weeks before Donald Trump's Iran nuclear deal ""fix it or nix it"" deadline, observers started to predict that he would force the Europeans into negotiating a side agreement that fixed the deal's holes other than the ""sunset clauses.""

The sunset clause issue was the concern that Iran's nuclear program would have no limits once the deal expired.

If a separate agreement could be signed to address Iran's ballistic missile program, its terrorism in the Middle East and the limits on IAEA inspectors' ability to inspect military sites for traces of nuclear weapons, then maybe the sunset issue could be worked out later.

Days before Trump's speech the narrative had shifted to that he would formally withdraw from the deal, but quietly look the other way on enforcing sanctions.

This was and is the heart of his speech.

All of the innuendo about being ""in"" or ""out"" of the deal matters, but the real question always was whether the US would enforce secondary sanctions against its EU allies and other countries if they do business with Iran.

Had Trump announced the US was exiting the deal, but left the sanctions issue vague and looked the other way while the EU and others did business with Iran, the deal could have been declared wounded, but not dead.

But that was not enough for the US president.

His strategy is clearly not to put band-aids on the deal's holes and ask Iran nicely through the EU to agree to some fixes.

And observers who say that he was only interested in keeping a domestic campaign promise missed some of the spirit of his speech and whom Trump has hired recently onto his national security team.

The Jerusalem Post has interviewed Trump's new National Security Adviser John Bolton multiple times.

Bolton is pro Iran-regime change and pro using brute military-diplomatic threats and brinkmanship to achieve desired policy goals.

Trump and Bolton want to stand over Iran threateningly and demand it agree to a new deal with all of the changes they want.

Why then should the deal be described as on its deathbed, but not totally dead?

The 90 days.

Trump did not mention the 90 days, but the way the sanctions work and as leaked right before his speech, the US nuclear sanctions as currently structured do not kick in for 90 days.

His mention of still wanting to cut a deal with North Korea also was a sign that he is willing to cut deals with a regime he has threatened, even if only on his terms.

That gives time to negotiate and salvage the situation.

At this point, whether that something is called a modified old deal or a new deal is less important than whether the US and Iran are on course toward some kind of détente or whether they are on course toward a conflict.

Critics of Trump have said that his leaving the deal will inevitably lead to war.

That is not true. Ninety days have to pass, Iran has to feel the heat enough to withdraw from the 2015 agreement, and it has to decide to dare the US by restarting to highly enrich uranium (as opposed to for example just start failing to cooperate on some smaller issue) before war is really in the air.

But by formally exiting the deal and signing sanctions to kick in in 90 days (another option was 180 days), Trump is signaling he is more comfortable with that living-on-the-edge scenario achieving his goals of Iran ending its pursuit of nuclear weapons and restraining its support for terrorism, than he is with another half-year of negotiations to only achieve some of his aims.

Whether the deal, or a new version, makes a late comeback or dies on the deathbed, is now mostly up to Iran and the EU.

Both Iran and the EU talked tough until recent weeks. The EU threatened to counter-sanction and sue the US in international forums. Iran threatened to pull out if the US committed even a minor violation of the 2015 agreement.

But in the last couple of days, both Tehran and Brussels have said they will keep the deal even if the US pulls out. That suggests Trump may have read their positions correctly and that they might respond to pressure. Still, Iran has never wavered from saying it will not amend the deal.

Within 90 days, we will likely know whether Trump's gamble is starting to pay off or whether the deal will have been killed with no plan B to block Iran from rushing to a bomb, other than a military strike.

",340966,"Iran's reaction to latest deadly strikes to determine the length and intensity of confrontation, say analysts.

 Israeli raids against alleged Iranian targets inside Syria have raised fears of a major confrontation in the Middle East.  Amid international calls for restraint and calm, Israeli officials said Thursday's attacks were not aimed at opening a new front in Syria's war, but analysts say much will depend on Iran's response.  The Israeli military has said that its warplanes targeted intelligence, logistics, storage and vehicles in response to rocket fire targeting its forces in the occupied Golan Heights, which it blames on Iran.  Avigdor Lieberman, Israel's defence minister, said the Israeli assault struck ""almost all of the Iranian infrastructure in Syria"", and added that Israel will desist from launching any further attacks. 

 ""I hope we finished this chapter and everyone got the message,"" he said, but warned that ""if it rains on us [Israel], it will pour on them [Iran].""  Iran has not commented on the rocket fire.  Situation unclear  The situation remains unclear, with an independent war monitor claiming  the rockets followed a ""first Israeli bombardment on the town of Baath"" in Quneitra province.  Also on Tuesday, Syrian state media reported attacks on a military base in Kisweh, south of Damascus, and accused Israel of carrying out the raid.  The strikes on Kisweh came shortly after President  Donald Trump  announced US withdrawal from the 2015  Iran nuclear deal , and resulted in the deaths of 15 people, eight of whom were Iranians, according to the war monitor.    Iranian forces based in Syria reportedly retaliated the next day, launching 20 rockets in the direction of the Israeli-occupied Syrian territory of Golan Heights.  The Israeli military accused Iran's Revolutionary Guard (IRGC) and its Quds Force, headed by General Qassem Suleimani, of being behind the attack.  Analysts said the Israeli retaliation was meant to signal Tel Aviv's resolve, without allowing the conflict spiral out of control.  ""I don't think Israel is interested in continuing a prolonged war with Iran because this might spill over to other theatres, including in Lebanon with Hezbollah, effectively making it a proxy war,"" Yossi Mekelberg, a professor of international relations at Regent's University, London, told Al Jazeera.  ""Israel runs the risk, by doing what it did, that Iran will feel almost obliged and forced to retaliate again.  ""That's the danger when things like this start, you don't know how and who's going to stop. You know how it starts, but you don't know how it will end.""  'We'd like to stop'  Mekelberg said the message that Israel was trying to get across is that it was not interested in escalation.  By saying ""we achieved our objectives, Israel is effectively saying 'we'd like to stop'"", he said.  However, ""the ball is now in the court of Iran.""  Ghanbar Naderi, an Iranian political analyst, said it was unlikely that Iran will pull back and relinquish all the gains it has made in Syria in recent years.    In Naderi's view, the attacks on Iranian outposts are a last-ditch attempt by Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, to save face as he struggles to accept the Syrian government and its Iranian backers' successive victories.  ""At the end of the day, this is a limited campaign in order to send the message that they have not lost the war.  ""I think they have lost the war and should call it quits and allow Syria to reconstruct itself from scratch,"" Naderi said.  Naderi, however, is unequivocal about Iran's willingness and ability to retaliate in the event of future Israeli aggression.  ""This is not the first time that Israel attacks Syria from the Golan Heights and certainly won't be the last one,"" he says.  ""We are expecting more attacks in the coming weeks and months. But the simple fact is that Iran is going to stay in Syria.  ""If Israel hits Syrian or Iranian forces, there will be retaliation. This is no longer the Syria of five or six years ago.""",31,"""If Israel hits Syrian or Iranian forces, there will be retaliation.",0.2337058335542679,3.776169776916504,3
"Will Iran execute or be targeted in an acknowledged national military attack outside of Syria involving Israel or any G7 nation between 23 August and 7 September 2018?
",656717,"May 12, 2018( Voice of America: http://www.voanews.com Delivered by Newstex)  In the escalating confrontation between Israel and Iran, Israel's defense minister called on Syria's President Bashar al-Assad on Friday to rid his country of Iranian forces based there, warning their presence would only cause more trouble for the war-ravaged country.  Avigdor Lieberman's comments were followed by threats from an Iranian cleric that Tel Aviv or Haifa would be in danger if Israel did ""anything foolish.""  The war of words followed the worst faceoff to date between Israel and Iran. Israel fired dozens of missiles at what it said were Iranian positions in Syria on Thursday, hours after it said its forces in the occupied Golan Heights had been targeted by Iranian rockets. The brief but intense confrontation raised fears the region may be sliding into an unprecedented direct conflict between the two archenemies. 

Here is a look at why the two countries are at each's other throats and why Syria could be the ground for a showdown. Why Syria? Iran sent massive military help to its ally, Assad, to rescue his rule against armed rebellion during that country's seven-year-old civil war. With the war winding down in favor of Assad, Israel   which saw him as the lesser of two evils compared with Islamic hard-liners among rebels   is now finding that his victory has brought Iran closer to its borders. Israel has increasingly warned that it sees Iranian influence in Syria as a threat, pointing to Iran's military presence inside the country as well as that of Iranian-backed militiamen. Israeli officials have said that 80,000 Shiite fighters in Syria are under Iranian control, including forces of Lebanon's Hezbollah and Iraqi and Afghan fighters. Iranian officials and their allies have spoken of securing a corridor from Iran to Lebanon, through Syria and Iraq. Israel fears that will allow Iran to more easily transfer weapons to Hezbollah, Lebanon's powerful Shiite guerrilla force, and reinforce the militant group's influence over the region. During the civil war, Israel is believed to have carried out hundreds of strikes in Syria, mainly hitting weapons shipments. Tension has been building. An airstrike on a military base in Syria last month, which Iran and Russia blamed on Israel, killed seven Iranians. In February, Israel shot down an Iranian drone that entered its airspace, triggering a clash in which an Israeli warplane crashed after being struck by Syrian anti-aircraft fire. What does the nuclear deal have to do with rising tensions? Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a sharp critic of the Iran nuclear deal. Now, with President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from it, Netanyahu may be emboldened to pursue his confrontation with Iran. Tehran, meanwhile, is under pressure from the U.S. and Western allies to negotiate a new deal, one that goes beyond restricting the nuclear program to curb Iran's military power in the region. Iranian officials have rejected any new accord. Tehran has not completely walked away from the nuclear deal, since the Europeans are still participating. But if it collapses and the U.S. imposes heavy new sanctions on Iran, prospects for major fallout with Israel are higher. Have Israel and Iran always been mortal enemies? During the rule of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, Iran had close relations with Israel, starting in the 1950s, including diplomatic representations and direct flights. The two countries were the main allies of the United States in the region, and Iranian oil was shipped to Israel during the 1973 war. But the 1979 Islamic Revolution ousting the shah ended that. The revolution's leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, declared Israel an ""enemy of Islam"" and cut all ties. Hostile rhetoric has escalated over the decades since. Israel considers the government in Iran an existential threat. But unlike Israel and its Arab neighbors, the two countries have never had a direct confrontation. Instead, Israel has fought Iran's ally, Hezbollah, the last time in a 2006 war that saw massive destruction in southern Lebanon and concentrated rocket fire on Israeli cities. Is the Mideast sliding toward an all-encompassing war? The reported Iranian attack on Israeli positions in the Golan and Israel's bombardment of suspected Iranian posts in Syria appeared to be warnings by each side that it is willing to respond   but not necessarily that they want to plunge into war. But if they do escalate, the region could face one of its worst cross-border conflicts in decades, one that could potentially drag in the United States, a major ally of Israel, and Russia, which is Syria's mightiest ally. Although Iran may not be a match for Israel's military power, it has a variety of allies and ways to hit back if corned by the U.S., Israel and Saudi Arabia, Iran's regional rival. Iran has an ally in Hamas, the Palestinian militant group in Gaza. In Lebanon, Hezbollah would stand ready to support its patron Iran. In Iraq, Iran sponsors a range of Shiite militias and has close ties to the political leadership. In Yemen, the war in its fourth year is seen as a proxy between Saudi Arabia and Iran and can be a place for Tehran to retaliate and increase pressure. Saudi Arabia already accuses Iran of providing missiles that Yemeni rebels have fired toward Riyadh.",35,The reported Iranian attack on Israeli positions in the Golan and Israel's bombardment of suspected Iranian posts in Syria appeared to be warnings by each side that it is willing to respond   but not necessarily that they want to plunge into war.,0.2363595962524414,3.776169776916504,3

That is, unless Iran were to act first.

He said: ""I do not anticipate asking for more dollars. Should Iran do something, that is a different issue. But no, I am not coming to you with an additional supplemental funding request.""

Anwar Gargash, UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, tweeted that Iran had been emboldened by the nuclear deal, and ""its ballistic missile program became both offensive and exportable"".

Trump has employed similar arguments, criticising the accord for failing to address Iran's ballistic missile program, its nuclear activities beyond 2025, or its role in regional wars.

Mohammed, another Saudi businessman, said: ""He is supporting us not because we are Saudi Arabia or because we have oil, but because he thinks we are right.""

Oman, which orchestrated secret US-Iran contacts that helped pave the way for the deal in 2015, was more measured.

Its foreign ministry said: ""We believe the United States and the Islamic Republic of Iran are interested in realising peace and stability in the region, and the choice of confrontation is not in the interest of either side.""

",454075,"Israel has launched its most intensive attack on Iranian positions in neighbouring Syria since the civil war began in 2011, bringing two of the region's major powers closer to the brink of direct confrontation than ever before.

The early morning bombardment killed 23 people, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said. It was issued in response to what the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said was the first ever Iranian rocket attack on its troops, in the Golan Heights.

The confrontation on yesterday marks the most significant military skirmish between the two enemies to date amid a backdrop of escalating regional tensions.

Theresa May and French president Emmanuel Macron have both called for ""calm on all sides"". Mr Macron is due to discuss the issue with German chancellor Angela Merkel later in the day.

The White House condemned what it said was Iran's ""provocative rocket attacks from Syria against Israeli citizens"", emphasising ""Israel's right to act in self-defence.""

Russia also called the strikes a ""alarming development"" and urged for a de-escalation. During the overnight incident civilians in both the Golan Heights, the Damascus countryside and Syria's south were kept awake by the sound of low-flying military jets and explosions.

Israel has been on heightened alert in recent days in anticipation of an Iranian attack: Tehran has vowed retaliation for two other recent Israeli strikes in Syria which targeted and killed at least 13 Iranian nationals.

The IDF said 20 Fajr or Grad missiles were fired by the Iranian Quds Force at its positions in the Golan Heights border area, several of which were intercepted by Israel's missile defence systems. No Israelis were injured.

Iranian officials offered no immediate comment on Israel's claim about the missile fire. Yesterday Lebanon's al Manar TV quoted the vice-president of Iran's National Security Committee as saying, ""Iran has no relation to the missiles that hit the enemy entity yesterday.""

The blistering Israeli response targeted what officials said was almost all of Iran's military infrastructure inside Syria, including dozens of weapons storage sites and intelligence centres used by elite Iranian forces, as well as Syrian air defence systems. The Syrian systems did not damage any Israeli planes.

""They need to remember the saying that if it rains on us, it'll storm on them,"" Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman told media yesterday. ""I hope we finished this chapter and everyone got the message.""

According to the Russian military, Israel fired more than 70 missiles during the attack.

Sana, Syria's state news agency, quoted a Syrian military official as saying Israeli missiles hit air defence positions, radar stations and a weapons warehouse, but claimed most incoming rockets were intercepted. It said the hostilities were triggered by Israeli fire over the border - something which has not happened since 1974. SOHR also said it believed the incident began with a volley of fire on the Qunietra region town of Baath.

According to Syrian army command three people died and two were injured in the attack. It was not immediately clear whether the casualties were Iranian or Syrian. SOHR said at least five Syrian soldiers were killed. Israel has largely managed to stay out of the complex seven-year-old conflict next-door, although the Golan Heights is restive and authorities have retaliated to occasional stray rockets with reprisals.

Around 100 Israeli airstrikes in Syrian territory in the last few years have aimed to prevent weapons smuggling to the Iran-allied Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, which also fights alongside Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's troops. Hezbollah, like Iran, is committed to the destruction of the Jewish state.

As Assad has slowly regained control of the country, tensions between Iran and Israel have ratcheted up, with Israeli officials warning they will not accept a permanent Iranian military presence in Syria.

Donald Trump's announcement earlier this week that his country would unilaterally withdraw from the landmark 2015 nuclear deal agreed between Iran and world powers has also set the Middle East on edge.

While Iran has said Israeli aggression against its troops in Syria will not go unheeded, Tehran's technical ability to hit back is limited.

Iranian officials are also wary of being drawn into a wider military escalation while they are trying to garner international support to save the nuclear agreement, which gave Iran sanctions relief in return for curbs on its nuclear programme.

Yesterday's flare-up came just hours after Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu returned from a visit to Moscow, where he and Russian president Vladimir Putin discussed Syria's war.

Russia militarily intervened in the conflict in 2015, turning the tide of the war in Assad's favour. Mr Netanyahu's office said after the meeting that Russia was ""unlikely"" to limit Israel's armed actions in Syria.",31,"While Iran has said Israeli aggression against its troops in Syria will not go unheeded, Tehran's technical ability to hit back is limited.

",524702,"The Middle East woke up to a more unstable and less certain world on Wednesday. Much remains unknown about the implementation and impact of US President Donald Trump's May 8 decision to reimpose all nuclear-related sanctions on Iran. But consequences will be multidimensional, and they will almost certainly hit the region a lot sooner than the up to six-month deadline Washington has given companies to cut commercial ties with Iran.

In addition to attempting to muffle the political fallout from the court case, the two have to address multiple points of confrontation -- including over Syria and its Kurds, arms purchases from Russia and US asylum for the Turkish cleric, Fethullah Gulen, accused of being behind the failed July 2016 coup attempt ( EC Apr.13'18 ).

Ankara's cooperation in Washington's aggressive new effort to isolate Tehran is critical. In addition to its regional clout, Turkey is the fourth-largest importer of Iranian crude, buying some 219,000 barrels per day over the last 12 months. But for Washington to have any hope of gaining traction in moderating Turkish commercial ties with Iran, some form of compromise is probably going to be needed on its other many points of dispute with Ankara.

So far, Tehran has said it will stay committed to its nuclear deal, provided Europe stays onside and the deal continues to deliver benefits. But on the face of it, Trump's announcement looks set to not just kill Iranian ambitions to attract Western investment to its upstream but also to smother already challenged regional energy projects -- particularly if the US decides to widen its sanctions campaign to include gas. Both Turkey, the biggest importer of Iranian gas, and Iraq, which also depends on Iranian gas, would bitterly oppose such a move, while Oman is also eyeing Iranian gas flows. Iraq also aims to export Kirkuk crude to northern Iranian refineries.

Meanwhile, increased aggression on the part of Iranian hard-liners and their regional proxies can be expected -- with the reimposition of Iranian oil sanctions as likely to play out in battlefields in Syria and Yemen as it is on international oil markets ( EC May4'18 ). That's already happening between Israel and Iran in Syria. For a still-fragile Iraq, the Iran decision is an unwelcome wildcard as it goes to the polls on May 12 ( EC Apr.27'18 ).

Opec, and US-Saudi, Tripwire?

Implementation of Washington's new Iran policy is likely to be a slower, more haphazard process than Trump would wish for ( related ). But there will be a supply impact, and it comes at a delicate time for Opec. The Saudi energy ministry on Wednesday vowed to ""mitigate the impact of any potential supply shortages,"" and Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said he would be ""connecting with other producers and major consumers over the next few days to ensure market stability.""

But Riyadh has a difficult balancing act. On a political level, it has been pushing for a concerted international effort against alleged Iranian regional aggression. But unwritten Opec rules dictate that any supply response to a shortage be consensual. In addition to destroying hard-won Opec unity, any unilateral Saudi action could threaten current cooperation with Russia-led non-Opec producers and unravel attempts to build a new Opec/non-Opec market management structure ( EC Mar.2'18 ). Gulf Opec sources tell <em>Energy Compass</em> that Riyadh will not back any action to respond to a short-term price spike and that a rollover is the most likely outcome of Opec's Vienna meeting in June ( related ).

Higher oil prices are already a problem in Saudi-US relations, with Trump last month tweeting complaints about Opec policy ( EC May4'18 ). The US leader told Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman during his April visit to Washington that he was losing sleep over the fact that Russia and Iran were reaping hundreds of millions of dollars a day in oil revenue as a result of high prices, one source tells <em>Energy Compass</em>. Saudi Arabia needs firm prices to balance the books and to lay the groundwork for a planned initial public offering (IPO) of Saudi Aramco. But price stability is paramount, and the last thing Riyadh wants is for high prices to spark such a surge in US shale output that it triggers another sustained price slump.

Trump has also voiced concern over Saudi Arabia's new energy alliance with Russia, the source adds. With historically frosty relations and opposing positions on Syria, Riyadh and Moscow are unlikely bed partners. But Russia's participation in the Opec/non-Opec deal and planned joint investments, including potentially a Russian stake in Aramco and Saudi investment in Russian LNG projects, serve both sides well. The danger is what happens if escalating international tensions prompt Washington to lean on Riyadh to ditch its new Russia alliance. 

This has been a good two years for Opec. Al- Falih has presided over a period of strong price recovery, organizational cohesion and unprecedented cooperation with non-Opec. But Trump’s Iran sanctions move threatens a cardinal tenet of Opec policy -- that oil and politics should not mix -- and how the organization responds is going to be critical.

11:30 p.m.

Israel's U.N. ambassador is calling on the U.N. Security Council and the secretary-general to immediately condemn Iran's missile attack and demand that Tehran remove its military presence from Syria.

Danny Danon said in letters to the council and U.N. chief Antonio Guterres that ""the international community must not stand idly by while a tyrannical regime attacks a sovereign nation and continues to threaten the very existence of a member-state of the United Nations.""

Danon said ""Israel is not interested in escalation, but under no circumstances will we allow Iran to establish a military presence in Syria whose purpose is to attack Israel and to deteriorate an already fragile situation in the region.""

The Security Council, which is deeply divided over Syria, is highly unlikely to issue a statement and no council member has asked for a meeting on the missile attacks against Israel and Syria. Secretary-General Guterres urged ""an immediate halt to all hostile acts"" to avoid ""a new conflagration"" in the Middle East.

___

8:55 p.m.

The United Nations says Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is urging ""an immediate halt to all hostile acts"" and provocative actions to avoid ""a new conflagration"" in the Middle East.

U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters the U.N. peacekeeping force on the Golan Heights has maintained contact with the Syrian and Israeli military, ""urging both parties to exercise maximum restraint"" and abide by the 1974 cease-fire agreement.

He said the secretary-general followed ""with utmost concern"" overnight reports of missile launches from Syria targeting Israeli positions and retaliatory strikes by Israel and is relieved at Thursday's ""partial normalization of the situation.""

Dujarric said Guterres is ""very engaged"" and has been in contact ""with various people at various levels"" about the attacks.

8:25 p.m.

Israel's prime minister says the strike on Iran's military installations inside Syria sent a ""clear message"" to President Bashar Assad not to attack Israel.

Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday in a statement that ""we are in a continuous campaign"" and that ""Israel's military had carried out very extensive strike against Iranian targets"" in Syria.

Netanyahu said Syrian batteries fired at Israeli forces ""and therefore we struck them.""

He warned ""whoever attacks us - we will attack them sevenfold and whoever prepares to attack us - we will act against them first.""

The prime minister issued the statement as Israel's security cabinet was meeting, according to media reports.

Israel said the targets of the strikes, its largest in Syria since the 1973 war, included weapons storage, logistics sites and intelligence centers used by elite Iranian forces in Syria.

Chancellor Angela Merkel's office says the German leader has condemned an Iranian rocket barrage on Israeli positions in the Golan Heights in a phone conversation with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani.

She also reaffirmed European powers' continued support for the Iran nuclear deal.

Merkel's office said the two leaders spoke Thursday. It said in a statement that Merkel underlined the support of Germany, France and Britain for the nuclear deal so long as Tehran continues to fulfill its obligations under that agreement. Merkel advocated opening talks with Iran on its ballistic missile programs and its activities in countries such as Syria and Yemen.

The statement said Merkel condemned the overnight attacks on Israeli positions ""and called on Iran to contribute to de-escalation in the region."" It didn't say how Rouhani responded.

3:45 p.m.

The White House has condemned Iran's ""provocative rocket attacks from Syria against Israeli citizens"" and expressed strong support for ""Israel's right to act in self-defense.""

The statement from press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders comes after the most serious direct military confrontation between the two bitter enemies to date. The Israeli military on Thursday said it attacked nearly all of Iran's military installations in neighboring Syria in response to what it described as an Iranian rocket barrage on Israeli positions in the occupied Golan Heights.

Sanders says: ""The Iranian regime's deployment into Syria of offensive rocket and missile systems aimed at Israel is an unacceptable and highly dangerous development for the entire Middle East.""

3:20 p.m.

A top official from the Arab Gulf country of Bahrain is defending what he says is Israel's ""right"" to defend itself after Israel launched overnight strikes on Iranian targets in Syria.

Foreign Minister Khalid bin Ahmed Al Khalifa wrote on Twitter Thursday that so long as Iran uses its forces and missiles to try and destabilize the region, ""it is the right of any country in the region, including Israel to defend itself by destroying sources of danger.""

Israel says Iranian rocket attacks on Israeli positions in the Golan Heights prompted the overnight strikes. Iran has not commented on the accusations.

Bahrain, a close U.S. ally, considers Iran a regional threat. The tiny island-nation accuses its Persian Gulf neighbor of arming and training Shiite Bahraini protesters with the aim of destabilizing the Sunni-ruled country. Bahrain has also welcomed President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from the nuclear accord with Iran.

Russia says the Israeli strikes on Iranian facilities in Syria have marked a dangerous escalation, urging both Israel and Iran to avoid provoking each other.

Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Moscow sees Thursday's strikes as a ""very alarming development.""

He noted that in contacts with the leadership of both countries, including a meeting Wednesday between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, ""we underlined the necessity of avoiding any actions that might be mutually provocative."" Netanyahu visited Moscow Wednesday to attend celebrations marking the WWII victory anniversary.

Israel said it struck dozens of Iranian targets overnight in response to a rocket barrage on Israeli positions in the Golan Heights, the biggest Israeli strike in Syria since the 1973 war.

Britain has condemned ""in the strongest terms"" a suspected Iranian rocket attack against Israeli positions in the Golan Heights.

In a statement Thursday, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson urged Iran to refrain from actions that could destabilize the region. Johnson also called on Russia to press the Syrian government, its ally, to work toward a broader political settlement.

The attack in the Golan prompted Israel to launch a wave of missile strikes at Iranian targets inside Syria. Iran has not commented on the exchange of fire. Syria's military said the Israeli strikes killed three people and damaged a number of its air defense units.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron are calling for de-escalation in the Middle East after an alleged Iranian rocket barrage on Israeli positions in the Golan Heights prompted Israeli strikes on Iranian targets in Syria.

Merkel and Macron met in Aachen, Germany Thursday on the sidelines of a ceremony where Macron was awarded a prize for contributions to European unity. The German government said they discussed events in the Middle East and called for ""level-headedness and de-escalation in the region.""

Merkel alluded to the two countries' support for the Iran nuclear deal. She said: ""We know that we face an extremely complicated situation here. The escalation of the last few hours shows it is truly a matter of war and peace, and I can only call on all involved to exercise restraint.""

Syria's military says overnight Israeli airstrikes killed three people, wounded two and destroyed a radar station, an ammunition warehouse, and damaged a number of air defense units.

Syrian Brig. Gen. Ali Mayhoub, who read the statement on Syrian television Thursday, says Syrian air defense systems had intercepted ""the large part"" of the incoming Israeli strikes.

Mayhoub did not say whether Iranian forces or Iran-backed militiamen were among those killed or wounded.

Israel's defense minister says the military struck ""nearly all"" of Iran's military facilities in Syria. A Syrian war monitoring group says the strikes killed at least 23 people, including five Syrian soldiers.

The Russian military says Israel fired more than 70 missiles at Iranian facilities in Syria and that Syrian air defenses shot down more than half of them.

Israel says it struck dozens of Iranian targets overnight in response to a rocket barrage on Israeli positions in the Golan Heights. It was the biggest Israeli strike in Syria since the 1973 war.

The Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement that 28 Israeli F-15 and F-16 fighter jets launched about 60 air-to-surface missiles during the two-hour raid early Thursday. It says Israel also fired over 10 tactical surface-to-surface missiles.

Russia is a key ally of Syrian President Bashar Assad, and has been waging its own air campaign on his behalf since 2015.

12:45 p.m.

A Syrian war monitoring group says Israeli attacks on several sites in Syria have killed 23 fighters, including five Syrian soldiers.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says Thursday the overnight attacks struck several military posts for Syrian troops and Iranian-backed militias near the capital, Damascus, in central Syria and in southern Syria.

The head of the Observatory, Rami Abdurrahman, said five Syrian soldiers, including two officers, and 18 militia fighters were killed. Abdurrahman says it is not immediately clear if Iranians were among those killed.

He says the toll is likely to rise because some of the wounded are in critical condition.

The Observatory says the strikes targeted suspected locations of the Lebanese Hezbollah group, as well as areas where Iranian advisers are believed to be based.

Noon

Syrian President Bashar Assad has accused U.S. President Donald Trump of saying one thing one day and the opposite the next, saying ""I don't think in the meantime we can achieve anything with such an administration.""

Assad spoke in an interview with the Greek Kathimerini newspaper published Thursday, before Israel carried out airstrikes in Syria in response to what it said was a cross-border rocket attack by Iranian forces.

He appeared to be referring to conflicting messages from the White House on how long it plans to keep American troops in Syria and its plans going forward.

Assad says wise Russian leadership has managed to avoid a full-blown conflict with Washington. He says: ""I hope we don't see any direct conflict between these superpowers, because this is where things are going to be out of control for the rest of the world.""

Both Russia and Iran have provided crucial military support to Assad's forces.

Israel's defense minister says the military has struck ""nearly all"" of the Iranian infrastructure sites in Syria.

Avigdor Lieberman says Thursday Israel responded fiercely to an unprecedented rocket attack by Iranian forces in Syria against Israel. He says no one was harmed in Israel and all the rockets were either intercepted or fell short.

Lieberman told the Herzliya Conference, an annual security gathering north of Tel Aviv, that ""if it rains on us it will be a flood on them.""

Israel attacked dozens of Iranian targets overnight in response to the rocket barrage on Israeli positions in the Golan Heights. It was the most serious military confrontation between Israel and Iran to date and Israel's biggest strike in Syria since the 1973 war.

CYRIL VANIER, CNN ANCHOR (voice-over): Outrage in Iran. Protesters hit the streets after the U.S. pulls out of the Iran nuclear deal.

Also a teenage girl sentenced to death in Sudan for killing her husband. She says he raped her in a horrific act.

Plus mixed messages: the president's lawyer suggests Mr. Trump tried to block the AT&T-TimeWarner merger but it turns out that depends on whom you ask.

Live from the CNN Center here in Atlanta, I'm Cyril Vanier. Great to have you with us.

(MUSIC PLAYING)

VANIER: So just days after U.S. President Donald Trump rejected the historic nuclear deal with Iran, anti-American emotions were on full display in the Iranian capital. The fate of the nuclear agreement now hangs in the balance.

Foreign minister Javad Zarif heads to Brussels next week to meet with his counterparts from France, Germany and the U.K. They'll be seeking ways to keep the deal alive without the U.S. If that last- ditch effort fails, however, Tehran warns it may start its uranium enrichment program on a, quote, "" industrial scale.""

Complicating this situation is the potential for military clashes between Iran and Israel. CNN's Ian Lee is in the Golan Heights, which Israel says was attacked by Iranian rockets earlier this week.

Ian, we keep seeing these flare-ups between Iran and Israel and we've kept seeing them since the beginning of the year and they've been getting worse.

So where is this headed?

IAN LEE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That's a question a lot of people are wondering, Cyril. You're right. We do see these flare-ups from time to time and they have gotten progressively worse. This just last week, we saw that worse flare-up as the two exchanged blows and Israel struck dozens of targets.

But right now, it has calmed down. But it's likely we'll see a flare- up again, as Iran says they're not going to abandon Syria and Israel says that, if they see something that crosses one of their red lines in Syria, which is essentially Iran establishing a strong military presence, a permanent military presence, then they say they reserve the right to act.

But both sides, both President Rouhani of Iran as well as the Israeli government officials have said they want tensions to ease.

VANIER: Let's talk Iran nuclear deal now. Tehran is trying to save this agreement, despite the fact that the U.S. pulled out.

So can this deal survive?

LEE: That's very difficult. And that's going to be up for the diplomats to decide, Cyril, if they can salvage this deal. Right now, we know that Iran's foreign minister, Zarif, is visiting different European capitals, members, signatories of this Iran nuclear deal to see if they can salvage it.

That includes the U.K., France, Germany, also talking with the Russians and the Chinese to see if they can move forward without the United States' part of it.

But it is going to be very difficult because the United States has said they're going to reassert sanctions and keep that pressure on them. And Iran has said, listen, if this deal does fall apart, then they're going to start enriching uranium on an industrial scale.

Now that doesn't mean that they're going to start their nuclear program and kick it back up, their weapons program, rather; but this does make for a more tense time.

VANIER: You've got another being piece of news coming your way in the next 48 hours or so. The U.S. embassy in Israel officially being moved to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv on Monday.

What is -- or what is going to be the Palestinian response to this?

LEE: Well, the Palestinians are outraged by the United States' decision to move. Essentially they said that the United States can no longer be a fair broker in the peace process, basically sidelining the United States, which has put the peace process really on freeze.

But when it comes to the embassy that day, specifically, we're expecting to see protests in the West Bank and in Gaza and specifically in Gaza. Over the past month and a half, every Friday, we've seen protests called the March of Return, where Palestinians inside Gaza go to the border.

And they say they want to return to lands that were lost during the 1948-49 war with Israel. And Israel said anyone who tries to get to that border fence, who tries to cross over it, that is a red line. And they have used lethal force, killing dozens of people. They've been criticized for that, especially with children being shot and killed and journalists. But Israel says, talking to some officials, they saying they're going to investigate those but they say that red line maintains itself.

[03:05:00]

LEE: So we're expecting this Monday to be the largest protests that we've in Gaza, which, Cyril, usually leads to the largest amount of violence.

VANIER: Absolutely, Ian Lee reporting live from the Golan Heights, thank you for your input, Ian, thanks.

VANIER: Let's bring in CNN global affairs analyst Kimberly Dozier.

Kimberly, does Israel feel it has a green light from the U.S. to move aggressively against Iran and Syria?

KIMBERLY DOZIER, CNN GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST: I think it's felt it had that for quite some time.

But on the Iranian side, there was a certain check to their action. They were staying within the lines, conducting a shadow war that, while they were aggressively supporting the Assad regime in Syria and supporting Houthi rebels in Yemen, they weren't overtly attacking Israel except a few furtive ventures with the drone in recent months.

But after Bibi Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel, had that display, where he had those thousands of documents that he had produced on television to show that Iran had been hiding, lying about its nuclear weapons program years ago, a display that was mostly thought to be aimed at president Donald Trump ahead of his decision about the Iran deal, we've seen Tehran take the gloves off.

VANIER: And Iran has been fairly quiet in its response about these Israeli strikes so far. For about 36 hours, it didn't even acknowledge them.

Is Tehran laying low on this because it's got bigger fish to fry, namely, saving the Iran nuclear deal?

DOZIER: Well, at this point they have some options. They could go with a Hezbollah reaction. Hezbollah has, Israel says, 100, 000-plus missiles trained south at Israeli territory. But --

(CROSSTALK)

VANIER: So that's the Shiite militia in Lebanon, in Southern Lebanon.

DOZIER: -- exactly.

But right now we've got European nations saying they want to try to save their side of the Iran deal. Britain, France, Germany have all said they're going to have a meeting to try to figure out if they can continue trade, if they can keep Iran economically with its head above water so that it's worth staying within the deal.

So from Tehran's point of view, that's a reason not to escalate militarily because the people within Iran are still waiting for the economic rewards of this deal.

VANIER: And this deal, can it really survive now that the U.S. has pulled out?

DOZIER: From what I'm hearing from European officials, they are scrambling to figure out how they can maintain some sort of trade ties. But from their perspective, they see slowly companies across Europe making the decision that, in the long term, the U.S. is going to make it too hard to do business with Tehran and, therefore, not worth it.

So from the diplomats I've spoken to, they're afraid it's a lost cause but at least they've got to try.

VANIER: So look, I've got to ask you this, then.

If the deal falls through, do that to unleash a more aggressive response from Iran in the region, then?

DOZIER: Probably so. The actions that we've seen so far, the missile volley over the border into the Golan Heights, may just be the first step. But Iran also knows that they've got to carefully calibrate this. If they go too far, they can get into an absolute fight with Israel.

So I think what you're going to see is harassment in various different locations, just pushing at the edges, which is something they've done very skillfully, while they hope their European allies can pull something off.

VANIER: Kimberly Dozier, CNN global affairs analyst, good to talk to you. Thank you.

DOZIER: Thank you.

VANIER: U.S. stealth fighter jets have intercepted a pair of Russian bombers in international airspace off the Alaskan coast. U.S. and Canadian military officials say the long-range Russian Bear aircraft were spotted Friday morning in the air defense identification zone around Alaska's western coast.

They eventually left the area. The last time U.S. jets intercepted Russian aircraft was a year ago this month.

And we have dueling messages coming from the Trump camp on the merger of media giants AT&T and TimeWarner, which, we should note, is CNN's parent company.

One message comes from the president's new lawyer, the other from the Justice Department. CNN's Hadas Gold lays out the facts.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

HADAS GOLD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Rudy Giuliani is causing another headache for the White House and now also the Justice Department this weekend. It is all because of comments he made in an interview with the ""Huffington Post.""

Giuliani told the ""Huffington Post"" that whatever lobbying Michael Cohen did on behalf of companies --

[03:10:00]

-- like AT&T, who paid him for consulting, as we've recently learned, did not work. Giuliani used the example of AT&T's proposed merger with TimeWarner.

Now the Justice Department blocked that merger. They sued to try to stop it because they said that it would harm consumers.

But Giuliani said in his interview with the ""Huffington Post"" that it was the president who denied that merger. Now that matters because the Justice Department is supposed to operate independent of the president.

And they said that they sued to block the merger without any sort of interference from the president or any sort of political bias.

Rudy Giuliani's comments fly in the face of that and, in fact, there was even a sworn affidavit from the head of the antitrust division for the Justice Department, saying that he was not influenced at all by the president or the White House or anybody involved.

But now Rudy Giuliani is saying that in fact Donald Trump himself was the one who denied this merger. The question now is what AT&T will do with this information. A judge is currently taking his time deciding whether this merger can go through or not. We're expecting that decision from him on June 12th.

But AT&T could issue new filings on appeal; they could try to bring up this political bias defense. It's really giving them another part of their arsenal that they can bring forth in this defense. But at the end of the day, it is just another Rudy Giuliani headache for the White House and the Justice Department -- this is Hadas Gold, CNN, Washington.

VANIER: Time is running out for a Sudanese teenager sentenced to death for murdering her husband while he allegedly raped her.

Noura Hussein's legal team has less than two weeks to appeal the court's sentencing decision. Her case has shone a spotlight on marital rape, which isn't recognized in Sudanese law. A man can legally force intercourse on his wife. Our Isha Sesay has been closely following this and she joins us now from London.

Isha, this is just a horrific story from beginning to end.

The question now, the most important question, can Noura Hussein survive this?

ISHA SESAY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That is the question that we're all contemplating and obviously, as people watch this story closely, are hoping --

[03:15:00]

SESAY: -- will be the outcome. But it is complicated by the fact that the sentence, the death penalty that was handed down was supported by her husband's family.

The husband's family basically could have seen Noura pardoned and a fine imposed but they specifically asked to see the death penalty imposed on Noura. In fact, when that judgment was handed down in the courtroom, clapped loudly and were quite jubilant at the fact.

Now as you've made clear, her lawyers have less than two weeks to appeal this. The hope is that, upon appeal, they will see that this was a forced marriage and will take into consideration the violence that Noura was subjected to and this death penalty will be done away with.

But it is really far from clear because to give context to our viewers, Sudan is a deeply patriarchal society. It is also a country, marriage is legal at age 10 and marital rape is legal.

So in the eyes of the culture, what Noura's husband did basically wasn't wrong. So it becomes very, very complicated to see how they would overturn this unless international pressure mounts to the point where the judges feels it's in the best interest of Sudan. VANIER: And there is right now significant support for her within the usual circles, which are NGOs, political activists.

But do we know -- and you started addressing this -- if there is support for Noura within Sudan?

SESAY: There actually is. This incident, this case has really shone a spotlight on the egregious treatment that women and girls face in many parts of Sudan. And Noura's courage, if you will -- and that's what it's been seen as by many women in Sudan, to basically run away, first of all, when the marriage was initially initiated, to run away to her aunt, where she stayed for three years and then to be brought back under false pretenses and married off, which resulted in this violent ending for her husband.

People see her as being incredibly brave and not being willing to accept the violent norms. And so a lot of women have stood up and expressed support for Noura. There are campaigns and there are petitions in the courtroom itself, when that death penalty handed down. It was full to overflowing, Cyril, with people from Sudan, standing up and saying she mustn't be put to death and that she herself was a victim in all of this.

VANIER: Isha, thank you so much for your update and for your great reporting. We're going to be following this. So there's a two-week clock that has started running as of yesterday. I was being told on an earlier show, speaking to somebody who's part of the campaign to help and support Noura Hussein.

Isha, we'll be hearing more from, you on this as well, thank you.

The World Health Organization is warning of a worst-case scenario as it ramps up its response to the current Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The WHO says there are now 32 suspected cases of the deadly disease. Two more have now been confirmed.

Officials say it will be tough and costly to stamp out the virus. The head of the WHO is traveling to the DRC in Central Africa this weekend to take stock of the situation.

And still in Africa, Kenyan authorities say the dam that burst on Wednesday and killed dozens of people was built illegally. At least 45 people are now confirmed dead and the local governor says 40 people are still missing. So that death toll may well rise.

Homes were swept away when the wall of the dam collapsed after heavy rain and flooding soaked the area. The Kenyan Red Cross estimates some 500 families have been affected.

VANIER: Residents of Hawaii's big island aren't out of the woods yet. It's been just more than a week since the Kilauea volcano's violent eruption. There haven't been new lava emissions since Wednesday. That's the good news.

But the threat of more explosions has again forced the closure of the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park.

And the final preparations underway for the wedding of the year. In just one week, Britain's Prince Harry and American actress Meghan Markle will tie the knot. And some royal watchers have already placed their bets on key wedding details. Max Foster, ever the gambler, has more.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

MAX FOSTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: A week to go and no official announcements about the wedding for days now. But that hasn't stopped the speculation. When there's a vacuum of information from the palace, we tend to revert to what people are betting on. So here's what Brits have been obsessing about this week.

First, the dress: Ralph & Russo are the firm favorites as the designers. Erdem and Christopher Bailey are the other front-runners. The palace insists they won't confirm or deny any of the rumors until Meghan actually steps out of the car at the church on the wedding day.

Maybe she's had two made and hasn't decided which to go for we could speculate for England.

Harry's outfit isn't causing nearly as much excitement of course but people are betting that Harry will be wearing a uniform on the day and money is also being placed on whether he'll keep his beard. Most thinking he'll shave it off for the big day.

Then the weather. This is the U.K. and we obsess about nothing more. There's a mini heat wave on its way. And bets are being placed on it being the hottest day of the year. Good news for Markle, who was brought up in the California sun. Less so for Harry, especially if he's in the stifling ceremonial uniform.

Finally, they aren't even married and people are already talking about the baby. Ladbrokes have slashed their odds on Markle making a pregnancy announcement by the end of this year.

Let's give them a chance, though, shall we, to enjoy their first big royal event together without any of this. Not long now -- Max Foster, CNN, London.

VANIER: And way before Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were even thinking about a walk down the aisle together, they were dealing with various struggles. CNN takes an inside look at their past and future in our special, ""A Royal Match: Harry and Meghan.""

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

ALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN ANCHOR: Harry wants to keep his relationship with Meghan private as long as he can. But just four months after that first date the news is out. And the paparazzi pounced once again.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: There was a photographer who got inside Meghan's house in Toronto. The paparazzi were camping on her mother's front lawn and following and harassing members of her family, anybody who knew her.

CAMEROTA: Despite starring in a TV show, Meghan is relatively unknown. Now the British press wants to know who she is and if she's fit for the royal family.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She was a woman who has been married. People are fascinated by the fact that she was divorced. People are fascinating by her background, her acting, a career woman.

How would that work being with someone in the royal family?

That's not what we've seen before.

CAMEROTA: They also have not seen someone biracial dating a member of the royal family.

[03:25:00]

CAMEROTA (voice-over): And some of the conversation is blatantly racist.

AFUA HIRSCH, JOURNALIST: There was one newspaper headline saying, ""Straight out of Compton,"" suggesting that she was from a gang-ridden neighborhood.

CAMEROTA: Afua Hirsch is a journalist and recently wrote a book about race, identity and belonging in Britain.

HIRSCH: Would Harry be dropping around for tea in gangland, which was very clearly racially loaded.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Another issue exploded which was the number of horrific social media racist comments began to flood in from the darkest, vilest corners of the internet.

As President of the United States, every move you make is magnified, analyzed, scrutinized. And Donald Trump's body language is no exception, especially when he crosses his arms, which he seems to do a lot. Jeanne Moos went in search of answers about Mr. Trump's signature moves.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

JEANNE MOOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Some tend to think of President Trump as a man you'd better not cross. But there he is, crossing his arms.

TRUMP: And I think it's a disgrace.

MOOS (voice-over): In a very un-Trump like gesture.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is a negative defensive gesture.

MOOS (voice-over): As the author of ""Famous Faces Decoded"" noted...

DAN HILL, DECODING EXPERT: But his shoulders hunched together, it's extremely unusual for Trump to make himself look smaller than he is.

MOOS (voice-over): -- normally his gestures are expansive, assertive. But it seems frequently...

TRUMP: And my performance --

MOOS: -- President Trump's been performing with arms crossed.

TRUMP: Didn't say what that congresswoman said. Didn't say it at all.

MOOS (on camera): Crossed arms even made it on to the list of the 10 worst body language mistakes to make in an interview.

MOOS (voice-over): Arms crossed over your chest signal defensiveness and resistance. When an expert like Dan Hill watches the president react to that FBI raid...

TRUMP: Democrats, all, just about all...

HILL: Underneath all the bluster and the anger is also a real sense of being under siege.

MOOS (voice-over): When the president had to listen to a Democratic governor argue against arming teachers...

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Packing heat in first grade classes.

MOOS (voice-over): -- his crossed arms weren't just defensive.

HILL: But it's also dismissive. He shows contempt on his face.

MOOS (voice-over): Comedians have their own theory.

TREVOR NOAH, HOST, ""THE DAILY SHOW"": I think it's so cute that, whenever Trump is out of his depth, he gives himself away with that little hug that he gives himself for comfort.

MOOS (voice-over): It's become so common, Alec Baldwin has worked the gesture into his ""SNL"" impersonation.

KATE MCKINNON, COMEDIAN, ""JEFF SESSIONS"": Just like skunk stink on a bird dog, sir, I linger.

MOOS (voice-over): The crossed arms even inspired a parody product.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice-over): Do you have a president who's unrelieved?

TRUMP: No, get those lights off. Off.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are his arm movements a danger to those around him?

Then we've got a solution. The straitjacket suit for presidents. It looks just like a regular suit. No one has to know.

MOOS (voice-over): It has a way of tamping down the president's --

TRUMP: Fire and fury.

MOOS (voice-over): Jeanne Moos, CNN...

TRUMP: Why don't I just fire Mueller?

Complicating this situation is the potential for military clashes between Iran and Israel.",0.24957621097564694,3.776169776916504,3
"Will Iran execute or be targeted in an acknowledged national military attack outside of Syria involving Israel or any G7 nation between 23 August and 7 September 2018?
",1187664,"PRESIDENT Trump announced on May 8, 2018 that USA was withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal. Prior to making this decision, he had rejected the earnest pleas of America’s close allies in Europe, apart from many circles in USA. He did exactly what he had promised during his election campaign. He reiterated that the deal was “defective at its core and could not be fixed” i.e. renegotiated. Trump also ordered his officials to immediately begin the process of reimposing sanctions related to the deal. These will target critical parts of Iran’s economy, such as its energy, petrochemical, and financial sectors.

 The Iran deal, named as Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), was signed in July 2015 in Vienna by USA, UK, France, Germany, Russia, China and European Union. Under the agreement, Iran scaled back its uranium enrichment programme and promised not to pursue nuclear weapons. In exchange, international sanctions against Iran were lifted, allowing it to sell its oil and gas world-wide. However, secondary US sanctions against Iran were never lifted. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has said all along that Iran has met its nuclear commitments. Its monitors, who regularly inspect Iranian nuclear facilities, have verified that Iran is complying with the terms of the deal. Trump’s unilateral withdrawal from JCPOA and imposition of sanctions puts the US in immediate violation of the treaty, which says that the sanctions will remain lifted as long as Iran is complying with its terms. JCPOA was negotiated mainly by ex-US Secretary of State John Kelly and was hailed as a great achievement by President Obama. But Trump and other Republican Party leaders, apart from Israel, kept condemning the deal, which Trump described last week as “decaying and rotten.” They allege that Iran is secretly continuing its pursuit of nuclear weapons, and the deal does not cover Iran’s non-nuclear weapons and missile programmes. The Trump administration has many pro-Israel and anti-Iran officials. Antipathy towards Obama is a part of Trump’s psyche. As expected, Israel has enthusiastically welcomed Trump’s decision. Notably, Saudi Arabia has also supported the US decision, due to its current bitter rivalry with Iran and its apprehension that Iran has nuclear ambitions. Obama reaction was that Trump’s decision could leave the world less safe and even lead to another war in Middle East. Fortunately, Trump’s withdrawal from the nuclear deal has not killed it. Iran has shown restraint and President Rouhani has declared that Iran remains committed to the deal. The EU remains supportive of the deal, and has said that the US does not have the power to unilaterally scrap the agreement. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini has said that the group was “determined to preserve” the deal as long as Iran remained compliant. UK, France and Germany remain committed to the treaty. Russia and China have no intention of leaving it. Inspite of these assurances, there is concern that the size and influence of the US economy might induce EU to eventually fall in line. Iran is now seeking assurances from other signatories of the Treaty that they will remain faithful to its provisions. Accordingly, Foreign Minister Javad Zarif started a mission on May 12 to Beijing, Moscow and Brussels to urge them not to give in to US pressure to halt trade with Iran. An Iranian government statement said that Zarif had been “tasked with the duty of taking the necessary measures to obtain guarantees from remaining parties of JCPOA as well as Iran’s other economic partners.” Iran is seeking assurances that European, Russian and Chinese companies will continue to do business with Iran, even in the face of threats that such companies might have to face US sanctions. The statement warned that Iran was making preparations so that it could resume “industrial scale” uranium enrichment. Such a move would be seen as a breach of the nuclear deal and could put Iran on a collision course with the US and Israel. In a tweet, Foreign Minister ZarIf warned that the outcome of his tour to partner states of the treaty “will determine our response”. Iran has vital stakes in protecting the treaty. For instance, next week, Airbus is expected to announce whether it will continue with a 15 billion pounds deal to supply Iran with 100 commercial airliners. The Iranian national airline has a fleet of aging planes which must be replaced. Iran’s main exports are oil and gas which would be adversely affected by US sanctions. But India and China, the two largest importers of Iranian oil, had been allowed waivers in the years prior to the nuclear deal and might again be exempted. Trump’s decision could also have implications for the Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline project, which has so far probably not taken off due to fear of US sanctions. Trump’s unilateral withdrawal fom the Iran deal would increase tensions in the Middle East and fuel an arms race. Emboldened by Trump’s deision on the nuclear deal, Israel has become more aggressive. The latet dangerous development is possibility of a military showdown between Israel and Iran inside Syrian territory, and perhaps even beyond. Iran has military forces in Syria, fighting in support of the Assad regime. Last week, Israel made an air attack on Iranian military in Syria, followed by a reported Iranian missile attack on Israeli-held Golan Heights. On May 10, Israel launched “Operation House of Cards” and claimed its warplanes had hit 70 targets across Syria. Israeli Defence Minister Lieberman asked Syria to “get rid of the Iranians” to avoid further such air strikes. Though Russia, Iran and Assad regime have been acting together in Syria, an aide to President Putin has now been reported as saying that Russia has not agreed to supply sophisticated S-300 anti-aircraft missiles to Syrian regime. This in effect would leave Iranian troops in Syria exposed to future Israeli strikes, and create problems between Russia and Iran. Some reports suggest that the Iranian missile attack on Golan Heights could increase friction in Iran itself between the hard-liners and the moderates led by President Rouhani. Revolutionary Guards could have launched this rocket attack to sabotage nuclear deal and weaken Rouhani.",45,"The latet dangerous development is possibility of a military showdown between Israel and Iran inside Syrian territory, and perhaps even beyond.",0.2517431676387787,3.776169776916504,3

",390665,"First there was the Trans-Pacific Partnership: just days after assuming the presidency in January 2016, Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the TPP, a trade deal he had referred to on the campaign as a ""rape of our country.""

Next was the Paris Climate Accord, which Trump pulled the US out of in June, six months after moving into the White House.

Now, a year later, he is pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal.

A month ago, Trump announced that he was reconsidering returning to the TPP after saying just a few months earlier that his administration is also considering reentering the Paris Climate Accord.

Then on Wednesday, a day after announcing that the US was leaving the Iran nuclear deal - also known as the JCPOA - Trump seemed to indicate what his ultimate plan was for stopping the ayatollahs' nuclear ambitions: either they sit down and negotiate a new deal, or ""something will happen."" What that ""something"" is, he did not say.

There seems to be a pattern here. Trump pulls out of deals that he campaigned against - likely because they were made by his predecessor Barack Obama - and then announces that he is ready to negotiate a new deal, one that will be better for America, simply because he - the ultimate dealmaker - will be making them.

In other words, it's not ideology that is pushing this, but rather a simpler equation. Trump ran a campaign based on a populist premise: Obama ruined America, and he was going to fix it by nixing all of the previous president's deals and making ones that are better. His decisions to pull out of the TPP, the Paris Accord and the Iran deal might be controversial and not fully supported by even his own staff, but he had no choice. He made promises to do so on the campaign trail.

That was also largely how the US media covered his announcement on Tuesday. Fox News, for example, ran a headline: ""Trump fulfills campaign promise, withdraws from Iran deal."" NBC News ran a similar headline: ""Trump kept his promise on Iran. But was it the right promise?""

In other words, it wasn't about the substance of the decision but rather that the president was doing what he said he would back when he was a candidate.

To know whether this was the right decision will require time, but it is interesting to note the striking overlap between those who oppose the Iran nuclear deal and those who are against the establishment of a Palestinian state.

The stances run basically along the same line of thinking: oppose conventional wisdom without offering an alternative. Many on the Right, for example, oppose the establishment of a Palestinian state. But when asked if that means they support a single state - for Israelis and Palestinians - they say no. So, what do they support? Unclear. Seemingly, just more of the status quo.

The same seems to be the case with many of the opponents of the JCPOA. They can speak for hours about the problems of the deal, but they offer no alternative. When asked whether they prefer that Israel attack Iran, they say of course not. They, too, seem to prefer more of the status quo.

Don't get me wrong. I, too, think that the Iran deal was highly problematic, primarily because it rewarded Iran while ignoring its ballistic missile program, the dangerous role it is playing in the region (Syria, Lebanon, Yemen and beyond), as well as the JCPOA's sunset clauses that will allow the Islamic Republic to obtain nuclear weapons with unprecedented ease once they kicks in.

Nevertheless, it also gave Israel and the Middle East some quiet and, in this region, even a day of quiet cannot be taken for granted.

Just look at the past week in Israel: Residents of the North were ordered into bomb shelters for the first time in years, 20 Iranian rockets were fired at the country, and the air force retaliated in one of the largest aerial operations in recent time. All in a span of two days.

It was this thinking, for example, that was behind Secretary of Defense James Mattis's support of the deal and IDF Chief of Staff Lt.-Gen. Gadi Eisenkot's recent declaration that from his perspective, the deal was working.

Both men recognized its many flaws, but also the deal's advantages of having a mechanism in place - even if flawed - that is stopping Iran (for now) from obtaining a nuclear weapon.

The problem is that whether they like it or not, Iran needed to be confronted, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was right that it is better now than later.

What happened late Wednesday night with the volley of 20 rockets fired at the Golan Heights is just a small taste of what Israel can expect if Iran is allowed to continue building up forces in Syria. It is further proof of why the government's approach to Syria might lead on the one hand to a larger conflict, but also of how it is preferable, from Israel's point of view, to fight Iran now rather than after it has built up more formidable forces in Syria.

What happens next with Iran's nuclear program remains unclear. There are a number of variables: When will sanctions go back into effect? What will Europe do? Will the US sanction European companies that do business with Iran? What will Iran do? Will it exit the deal or stay in it?

The bigger question is, what did Trump promise Israel? While Netanyahu was the deal's fiercest opponent, he would have wanted to receive some sort of assurance from Trump about the ""day after"" the accord fell apart. Will the US support Israeli action to stop Iran, including a unilateral military strike? Has the president promised Netanyahu that America will attack if Iran refuses to enter into a new - and better - deal that will forever stop its nuclear program?

If, for example, Trump's strategy is to threaten the use of military force if a new deal is not reached, then that actually has the chance of working. In the past, Iran showed a willingness to make the greatest concessions on its nuclear program when it feared military intervention. That was the case in 2003, when it temporarily suspended its weapons program after the US invaded Iraq. Iran feared it was next in line and did not want to provoke George W. Bush.

This was one of the main weaknesses of the Obama administration. No one - particularly in Iran - ever believed that Obama would use military force. As a result, Tehran was able to gain the upper hand in the negotiations that culminated in the flawed 2015 deal.

Trump is different. He has used military force twice in Syria and is unpredictable. What he says today might be meaningless by the time tomorrow's tweets roll along. Iran knows and fears this.

If nothing else, when it comes to Israel, Trump has proven himself to be a man who keeps his word. He might be working on a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians, but at least for the last 18 months, he has not tried to force it down Israel's throat. He has now exited the Iran deal - realizing a Netanyahu fantasy - and will be moving the US Embassy to Jerusalem on Monday. Every US president for the last 30 years promised to do that, but Trump is the only one to keep his word.

That is notable. Now the question is: what will his final word be on Iran and its nuclear program?",48,"Will the US support Israeli action to stop Iran, including a unilateral military strike?",0.2533416748046875,3.776169776916504,2

scope of coverage for such a scheme, the detail will be set out in regulations but our intention to only rely users travelling internationally to do this, and all trailers over 3.5 tonnes will need to be registered. The duty to register applies almost exclusively to international hauliers. Virtually all private use trailers won't fall in the scope of mandatory registrations. We are going to be consulting on the scope of the registration scheme over the next few months and trying to make sure we are in good shape later this year to have the right scheme put in place depending on the nature of our agreements and what is required to ensure the smooth flow of trade across borders. 

Again we plan to recover the costs of running the scheme through the charging fees but we expect those to be lower than those currently set out for the registration of motor vehicles. It's important in these new arrangements are complied with and if not we will apply existing penalties to those who transgress. Many hauliers will hire trailers for specific uses. Obviously if they have been used predominantly in the UK they won't be registered. What timescale would be reasonable for a trailer to be registered if it embarks on an international journey? In all of this, we are going to want as rapid as possible a process. There will be a surge at the start for those hauliers looking to register trailers, my hope is that after that it can be done quickly for a change of circumstance but we don't expect a system that is so expensive that it is a deterrent to somebody who wants to register a trailer in case it is used internationally, we want to make sure there is a small cost to business. Many people will want to register trailers in case the situation highlighted happens. May I say a quick word about trailer safety. We listened carefully to the debate, we think it's an area where proper analysis will be beneficial, will help safety on our roads and we think we can offer off the back of that clear and comprehensive analysis of the issue of trailer safety. I think a constructive elements came out of the debate in the other place which we will certainly engage with. Let me touch chiefly on the issue of the island of Ireland. The bill covers the whole of the UK other than the sections and amending legislation in Great Britain and Northern Ireland respectively. Trailer registration are devolved in Northern Ireland but not Scotland and Wales. We will be working with old devolved assemblies and administrations as the bill develops but with regards to the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland this bill supports the commitment made in the report. The Government will preserve the constitution and economic integrity of the UK. The Government is committed to ensuring trade in everyday movements over the land border continue as they do now and the bill does not create a permit regime in relation to the Republic and Northern Ireland, nor does it create a hard border between them and it means trailers travelling only between UK and Ireland will not need be registered. It also avoids the situation of someone needing a permit even if only travelling within the UK. They will not be any new transport related checks at our borders. Just for clarification, will this mean there has to be a separate agreement between the UK and Irish government so that people who are taking lorries across the border, whether through Ireland to the rest of Great Britain or simply carrying loads from Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic that a separate arrangement covering those kind of movements? He will understand I can't speak for the Irish government. We are putting in place a mechanism that ensures no issue our way. The Irish government is perfectly able, as is any other government, to put barriers in the way of trade. We won't do that, we won't create a regime that affects those travelling into the Republic of Ireland, or through to the UK. I cannot give guarantees on behalf of the Republic of Ireland but I cannot believe they will want to put in place administrative systems that we don't put in place.

",233813,"Members of the British parliament will be offered a chance to vote on remaining in the European Economic Area (EEA) after leaving the European Union, following a surprise vote in the House of Lords late on Tuesday (8 May).

Despite neither the UK government nor the opposition Labour party leadership approving it, an amendment to the EU withdrawal bill obliging the UK to stay in the European Economic Area after it leaves the EU in 2019 was backed by a majority of 245 Lords against 218.

The vote result came as a surprise, because Labour had urged its peers to abstain in the vote. But 83 Labour peers revolted against Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's strategy and secured the majority by voting for the amendment.

As all amendments that are passed by the Lords must automatically be considered and voted on by MPs, the Commons will now need to vote on it too, which could happens as soon as next week.

The Norway model

The EEA is also known as the 'Norway model', because Norway is the most important of the three non-EU countries currently using the model for their relations with the European Union.

Legally EEA members are all the EU countries plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.

Under the model Norway has agreed to accept all EU legislation regarding the single market, and to accept all future legislation that the EU might adopt for the single market in return for free access to the European single market.

The amendment in the House of Lords to stay in the EEA was tabled by Labour Lord Alli, who asked fellow Lords to ""support it and ensure that common sense prevails over political dogma"".

Eurosceptics argue that it would leave Britain as ""a vassal state"" to Brussels.

Stephen Kinnock, a Labour MP and a member of the Select Committee on Exiting the European Union supported in a comment in the Guardian the Norway model, saying that staying in the European Economic Area ""would not transgress the prime minister's red lines on the single market or on ECJ jurisdiction"".

""By committing to an EEA-based Brexit the government would be providing business, consumers and our entire country with the certainty and stability that is so desperately needed,"" Kinnock added.

Under EEA has Norway effectively renounced the right to adopt national legislation that may be in violation of the single market's legislation.

In return, Norwegian businesses and citizens get free access to the European single market.

Norwegian companies are able to compete for contracts on equal terms with EU companies and Norwegians can travel to and work in other EEA member states, while citizens of the EEA can travel to and work in Norway.

The EEA agreement does not come however free of charge. In the 2014-2021 agreement period, Norway will pay a total of almost â‚¬2.8bn.

A separate Surveillance Authority and Court of Justice ensures that obligations under the EEA agreement are fulfilled.

Stronger EEA

Theoretically, Norway can say ""no"" to new legislation if Norway feels it conflicts with its national interests or is irrelevant to the EEA. But until now, this has not happened.

There has also been surprisingly little debate in Norway about the agreement.

The reason is that it forms part of Norway's national compromise on its relationship with the EU.

A December opinion poll from Nationen and Klassekampen newspapers showed that a majority of 52 percent of Norwegians would vote yes to the EEA if a referendum was held tomorrow. While a larger majority of 66 percent would vote no to EU membership.

According to the Norwegian government would the EEA membership expire automatically when the United Kingdom leaves the EU.

The procedures are governed by Article 127 of the EEA Agreement but the article does not contain specific provisions for the negotiation of a withdrawal agreement, as provided for in Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union.

The article states that at least twelve months' notice must be given in writing for a country to leave the EEA, but so far has the UK not asked to withdraw, despite there being currently less than a year to when Britain leaves the EU.",29,"The article states that at least twelve months' notice must be given in writing for a country to leave the EEA, but so far has the UK not asked to withdraw, despite there being currently less than a year to when Britain leaves the EU.",0.4539358019828797,5.5672361850738525,3

The Bulgarian diplomat pointed out that 25 percent of the outstanding issues related to Brexit were yet to be settled​​​.

Zaharieva called for more intensive engagement of London in talks with Brussels on the withdrawal-related issues.

Key issues related to the UK exit from the European Union should be resolved by the sides by October, since the Brexit deal needs to be adopted by the national parliaments before the actual withdrawal takes place, Zaharieva pointed out.

During the March 23 meeting, the European Council adopted the guidelines on the framework for a future relationship with the United Kingdom after Brexit.

",1007732,"FRENCH Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian has called on the European Union to set a ""final deadline"" for the UK to finalise its plans on the ongoing Irish border issue, which is threatening to delay Brexit negotiations.

The UK is committed to avoiding a reimplementation of a hard border with checkpoints between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which all sides regard as being vital to upholding the 1998 Good Friday agreement.

Speaking to the press in Dublin prior to a meeting with Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney, Mr Le Drian said: ""What we want is for things to go quickly and a June deadline chosen as the final deadline otherwise the withdrawal agreement will be more complicated.

""The June deadline is the deadline that must be seen as the ultimate deadline.""

Despite Brexit Secretary David Davis previously describing the EU's demand for sufficient progress to be made on the issue by June as an ""artificial deadline"", Mr Le Drian said the issue could not be delayed.

Mr Coveney suggested that a Customs Partnership between the EU and Britain could solve the issue surrounding the Northern Irish border.

GETTY

Jean-Yves Le Drian has said the UK must finalise the Irish border issue in June                                            

He noted that the Irish Government was flexible on how Theresa May resolved the issue, but insisted they would not accept any arrangement that could lead to the reimplementation of a hard border.

He said: ""We are happy to be flexible if the British government comes forward with some new thinking, but what we are not flexible on is the outcome.""

The Customs Partnership option would see the UK collecting import tariffs on behalf of the EU, but this option was previously rejected by six of Mrs May's 11 ministers in her Brexit Cabinet.

Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson commented on the Customs Partnership option, saying: ""If you have the new customs partnership, you have a crazy system whereby you end up collecting the tariffs on behalf of the EU at the UK frontier.

""If the EU decides to impose punitive tariffs on something the UK wants to bring in cheaply there's nothing you can do.""

GETTY

Theresa May said that 'any customs agreements must create as little friction as possible for trade'                                            

Henry Newman, the Director of think tank Open Europe, also criticised the option, saying: ""Customs Partnership could entail the UK paying very large sums of money to the EU in the long-term - something the Government has so-far ruled out.""

Commenting on the deadlock in Cabinet surrounding the UK's future customs arrangement with the EU, Mrs May said she had proposed various options and that the Government would continue to work on them during the upcoming negotiations.

Writing in The Sunday Times, she said: ""Any agreements must create as little friction as possible for trade.

""We must not constrain our ability to negotiate trade agreements with other countries around the world by being bound into a customs union.""

She noted the final deal must protect the UK's constitutional and economic integrity and honour Northern Ireland's peace agreement.

This comes after DUP leader Arlene Foster said her party would not accept any Brexit outcome which could lead to regulatory divergence between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.

However pro-Brexit ministers, including Michael Gove, prefer the 'maximum facilitation' option, which would involve using technology and a 'trusted fader' plan to reduce post-Brexit customs checks by monitoring the border and goods passing through it.

Critics have nevertheless argued the implementation of this system and the development of the necessary technology would take too long and would run the risk of re-implementing a certain degree of border friction.

If the UK is unable to finalise its customs arrangement prior to the Brexit deadline in March 2019, the UK may then be obliged to follow the EU's Irish border 'backstop' option.

This would force Northern Ireland to remain in 'full alignment' with the EU, and follow the regulations of the Customs Union and Single Market in order to avoid the reimplementation of a hard border.

",482363,"It has been over two years since the Brexit vote. Despite recent agreement within cabinet (and the subsequent resignations), a deal is yet to be agreed with Brussels. As a result, there is still no clarity on how VAT and customs duty will apply in relation to supplies to and from the EU once Brexit takes full force. Businesses need to be prepared for change, but how? As the future is often dictated by the past, we have compared the current position against what it may become in order to assess what businesses can do to prepare.

VAT

The position now

At the moment, VAT is broadly charged on supplies between the UK and EU as follows:

Goods received in the UK from the EU are technically called intra-EU 'acquisitions'. For supplies of such goods, the VAT position is typically as follows:

 UK VAT registered businesses receiving EU goods should not be subject to any upfront VAT cost. Instead, the UK buyer accounts for the VAT under the 'reverse charge' procedure. In practice, this means that the EU seller does not charge VAT and the UK buyer treats the supply as a supply to itself. The UK buyer records the UK VAT that would have been payable as output tax in its UK VAT return, which it can then recover as input tax in the same accounting period. Provided the UK buyer is entitled to fully recover the VAT, the transaction should not result in any VAT cost or cash flow issue.UK non-VAT registered businesses or UK private individuals receiving EU goods are subject to the 'distance selling' rules. Broadly (subject to certain exceptions), this means that the UK buyer will be subject to VAT wherever the supplier is based, unless the EU supplier's annual sales to the UK exceed £70,000, in which case UK VAT is payable (and is not recoverable) by the UK buyer

Goods received in the EU from the UK are technically called intra-EU 'dispatches'.

 If the EU buyer is VAT registered in the EU, the UK seller can zero-rate the supply, provided the goods are removed from the UK within three months from the time of sale and certain evidence is obtained. The EU buyer then accounts for VAT at the prevailing VAT rate in its home jurisdiction.If the EU buyer is not VAT registered and/or is not required to be VAT registered in the EU (such as a private individual), under the distance selling rules the UK seller must charge UK VAT. However, if the value of the UK seller's distance sales to the EU recipient's jurisdiction exceeds that jurisdiction's distance selling threshold, the UK seller must register for and charge VAT in the relevant EU jurisdiction.

Goods bought and received in the EU (i.e. they are not moved to the UK) are subject to sales VAT in the member state where the goods are located.

 If the UK VAT registered buyer is entitled to recover input VAT, they should be able to recover such non-UK sales VAT relatively easily through the electronic EU cross-border refund system. This system is made possible by virtue of the VAT information exchange system (VIES) for member states, meaning that the authorities can ascertain whether VAT has been correctly applied and paid. The time limit for applying for the refund is nine months after the end of the calendar year the VAT was paid. The UK trader should receive the refund within the time limits applied in that member state, which are ultimately prescribed by overarching EU rules.If the UK VAT registered buyer on-sells those goods to private customers in that EU member state, they may have to register for, and charge, VAT in that member state.

Goods bought within EU supply chain arrangements known as 'triangulations' are subject to simplified reporting and payment systems. For example, a triangulation might typically involve a UK VAT registered supplier purchasing goods in an EU member state (such as France) to be sent directly from that EU state to its VAT registered customer in another EU member state (such as Germany). Under the normal rules, the UK seller would have to register for VAT in Germany and charge German VAT. Under the simplified EU triangulation system, the UK trader need not register for VAT in Germany and can instead simply:

 give its VAT number to the French trader who can then zero rate that supply;obtain the VAT number from the German business customer so it can zero rate its supply (provided the relevant requirements are met); and include its supply on its EC Sales list.

The German customer can in turn account for German VAT under the reverse charge (if the requirements are met). Overall, the transactions should be tax neutral for the businesses if they are entitled to full recovery of input VAT.

Intra EU services are broadly subject to VAT as follows (subject to exceptions for certain services):

 A UK VAT registered business supplying services to VAT registered businesses in the EU is not subject to UK VAT. The EU recipient will account for the EU VAT under the 'reverse charge' procedure in its jurisdiction.A UK VAT registered business supplying services to private consumers or non-VAT registered businesses in the EU must charge UK VAT on those services.An EU VAT registered business supplying taxable services to VAT registered businesses in the UK should be VAT neutral using the reverse charge system. The UK recipient will account for UK VAT under the UK 'reverse charge' procedureAn EU VAT registered business supplying services to private consumers or non-VAT registered businesses in the UK should not charge UK VAT, but may have to charge VAT in its EU jurisdiction.

The position that may be

The UK government and EU negotiators have jointly confirmed that the existing VAT rules will continue to apply after the UK leaves the EU on 29 March 2019 until 31 December 2020. After this date, the UK could become subject to VAT requirements in one of the following two ways:

 The UK would continue to be treated as within the EU VAT area, meaning that the treatment above would continue to apply. In light of the prescriptive transitional period fiercely negotiated in Brussels, this is unlikely to be the case after 31 December 2020.The UK would leave the EU VAT area (which will be the case by law, unless a deal is reached). The UK will be treated by the EU as a 'third country' and vice versa. If this were the case:Goods received in the UK from the EU will be treated as 'imports' from a third country and would therefore be subject to UK import VAT, unless a relief applies. Where applicable, the import VAT would have to be paid upfront in order for the goods to clear customs, even potentially in the case of low value goods. Whilst UK VAT registered business receiving such goods in the course of their business should be able to reclaim the import VAT on their next VAT return, this would cause a cash flow issue whilst they await refund of the import VAT from HMRC.Goods received in the EU from the UK, will be treated by UK customs as 'exports' to a third country. Regardless of whether the EU buyer is VAT registered or not, a UK VAT registered seller exporting such goods to the EU should be able zero-rate the supply, provided the goods are exported by the seller within three months and certain evidence requirements are satisfied. However, the goods will likely be subject to import VAT in the buyer's EU jurisdiction, with the buyer having to pay that VAT at the point of entry. If eligible, the buyer may then be able to claim a refund. The timing for receiving that import VAT refund will vary across member states - in some jurisdictions it has been known to take years.Where UK VAT registered businesses have bought and received goods in the EU and incurred sales VAT in the relevant EU member, they should still be able to recover such non-UK sales VAT from the member state. However, as above, they can only do so under the more laborious 13th Directive process, which is likely to prolong the cash flow issue.In relation to UK/EU supply chain triangulations, if the simplified EU triangulation system is withdrawn, the UK trader in our example above would have to register for VAT in Germany in order: (1) for the French company to zero rate its supply to them; and (2) to charge German VAT to the customer. Obtaining an EU VAT registration may prove onerous as the UK trader may have to satisfy statutory requirements in order to qualifyFor UK/EU services, the net VAT position under the general rules should be broadly unchanged after 31 December 2020, as the reverse charge procedure should apply regardless of whether the recipient is EU or non-EU. However, in relation to the exceptions to the general rules, the administrative requirements may be drastically different. For example, UK suppliers of digital services to EU private consumers will no longer be able to use a single VAT registration under the EU mini-one stop shop (the MOSS scheme) and may therefore have to register and file for VAT in every country in which they make such supplies.On a minor positive note, the current filing obligations in relation to intrastat declarations and EC Sales Lists may no longer apply after 31 December 2020.

Customs duty

The position now

Currently, goods passing between the EU and the UK are not subject to customs duty and benefit from 'lighter touch' customs checks.

The position that may be

From 11pm on 29 March 2019, the UK will likely lose its membership to the Common Transit Convention. Whilst existing customs procedures will continue until 31 December 2020, the customs rules as we know them will no longer apply. This means that importers may become subject to additional administrative requirements, including obtaining import registrations and submitting customs declarations every time goods come in and out of the EU. The reliefs currently available may also not apply. This is likely to result in delays to the passage of goods through the UK/EU border.

As well as these additional administrative requirements, if the UK is no longer part of the European Single Market or the Customs Union, goods crossing the UK/EU border may become subject to customs duty (in the UK and in the EU). Unlike VAT, customs duty is not recoverable, though it may be deductible as a business expense.

The government previously proposed the following two options for the future customs position:

 A highly streamlined customs arrangement, also known as the 'maximum facilitation' (or the 'max fac') option. Under this option, the UK would trade with the EU effectively as a third party but would look to retain duty-free and administration-free access to the European Single Market, ideally without being subject to decisions by the European Court of Justice. This is the government's preferred option and is legislated for in the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Bill 2017/19. The Bill is currently at report stage in the House of Commons.A new customs partnership with the EU, under which the UK would align its approach to customs with the EU in such a way that the UK/EU border would not be necessary. Under this option the UK would remain subject to European regulations and decisions of the ECJ.

Following negotiations at Chequers on 6 July 2018, the cabinet announced a collective stance from which to negotiate a customs deal with the EU. This third model intends to create a post-Brexit free trade area for goods, subject to a common rule book, common cross-border processes and procedures for VAT and a new 'facilitated customs arrangement' that would remove the need for customs controls at the border. According to the White Paper published on 12 July 2018, the arrangement would involve the UK applying the EU's tariffs for goods intended for the EU, and the UK's own tariffs and trade policy for goods intended for consumption in the UK. Negotiations with Brussels will commence on this footing.

If no deal is reached in Brussels, the UK and EU would treat cross border supplies in the same way as they currently treat trade with third countries. UK businesses exporting goods into the EU would be subject to the relevant member state's duty regime for third countries. On the other hand, the UK could set its own tariff s for goods imported from the EU and would be free to negotiate preferential trade deals with non-EU states.

It is also possible that the UK could become a member of the European Economic Area (EEA) and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) under an arrangement similar to that of Norway. Norway has partial access to the European Single Market but is not part of the Customs Union. As a result, Norway is granted preferential duty treatment provided certain evidential requirements are met. Such an arrangement would likely require the UK to harmonise its laws to recognise EU requirements.

Preparing for Brexit

Things to consider from recent developments

The EU VAT system is itself due to undergo signifi cant reform by 2022, especially in relation to small and medium enterprises and e-commerce. Th ese changes are subject to ongoing discussions, in which the UK government has been openly involved.

As announced in the UK and EU's joint statement of 19 June 2018, the UK will retain access to the VIES until 31 December 2024 and the EU refund procedures will remain valid for claims submitted by 30 April 2021 and handled by 31 January 2022.

What businesses can do to prepare for Brexit

In case of the UK being treated as a 'third country' by the EU and vice versa, UK businesses importing goods from the EU may be able to mitigate the consequences of the Brexit by considering the following steps:

 Setting up a duty deferment account with HMRC, allowing import VAT and customs duty to be paid monthly in arrears, usually subject to a bank or insurance backed guarantee.Opting to fi le monthly VAT returns. Whilst this will involve additional administration and cost, it should shorten the gap between paying import VAT and reclaiming it as input tax.Appointing a fi scal representative to ease the administrative and fi nancial burden.Obtaining 'authorised economic operator accreditation' for goods to clear customs faster.Considering a business restructure and/or reviewing supply chain options.

INTRODUCTION Council Regulation (EC) No 723/2009 on the Community legal framework for a European Research Infrastructure Consortium1 (hereinafter referred to as “the ERIC Regulation”) was adopted in 2009 in order to facilitate the establishment and the operation of large European research infrastructures among several Member States and associated countries by providing a new legal instrument, the European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ERIC). The ERIC Regulation was amended in December 20132 to allow better reflection of the contributions of associated countries in the ERIC by putting those countries at an equivalent level as Member States in the governing bodies of the ERIC in terms of voting rights in the light of the possible hosting of ERICs in associated countries. 

The first report on the application of the ERIC Regulation was adopted by the Commission on 14 July 20143 and in accordance with Article 19 of the ERIC Regulation submitted to Council and the European Parliament. It was also submitted to the Committee of Regions and the European Economic and Social Committee. In its conclusions of 5 December 2014, Council ""WELCOMES the progress reported by the Commission in its first Report on the implementation of the ERIC Regulation, and INVITES the Commission to present the next ERIC implementation Report by 2017. INVITES the Commission and Member States to take appropriate measures to facilitate the use of the ERIC instrument and to stimulate investments in ERICs and other ESFRI Roadmap Infrastructures, for example as concerns in-kind contributions."" The second report on the application of the ERIC Regulation has been drawn up by the Commission pursuant to this invitation from Council. 2. BACKGROUND The ERIC Regulation addresses one of the major difficulties that was identified for the establishment of new European Research Infrastructures, apart from scarcity of resources and the complexity of technical and organisational issues, i.e. the lack of an adequate legal framework agreed by all countries allowing the creation of appropriate partnership with partners from different countries. 1 OJ L 206, 8.8.2009, p. 1. 2 OJ L 326, 6.12.2013, p.1. 3 COM(2014) 460 final EN 2 EN The ERIC Regulation facilitates the quicker establishment of European Research Infrastructures by saving time in avoiding the repetition of negotiations, project by project, to analyse and discuss the best legal form for such international research organisations, with related advantages and disadvantages and the time saved in avoiding discussions in each national parliament related to the approval of a needed international agreement in case the ERIC Regulation would not have existed. The ERIC Regulation also responds to the European political ambition of creating the European Research Area to enable tackling current challenges (e.g. internationalisation of research; achievement of critical mass; development of distributed facilities; development of reference models). It contributes to building an EU identity around flagship scientific facilities leading to the increase of the positive image of the European Union at international level by providing the international counterparts with a single legal entity of which they could become member or with which cooperation and possible partnerships could be agreed. The ERIC legal structure is used to establish and operate different types of research infrastructures, either single-sited or distributed. Distributed research infrastructures may range between research infrastructures having facilities located in different sites, operated by a single legal entity, and research infrastructures set up as a central hub coordinating the operation of distributed facilities which may retain their legal personality. Almost all of the ERICs that have been established until now operate distributed research infrastructures. 3. LEGAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ERIC The ERIC Regulation provides a common legal framework based on Article 187 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) complementing national and intergovernmental legal and regulatory schemes for establishing transnational Research Infrastructures. According to the ERIC Regulation, an ERIC is a legal entity with legal personality and full legal capacity recognised in all Member States. It requires membership of at least three states: one Member State and two other countries that are either Member States or associated countries. Its members may be Member States, associated countries, third countries other than associated countries and intergovernmental organisations. They jointly contribute to the achievement of the objectives of an ERIC, primarily the establishment and operation of a research infrastructure of European importance. Member States, associated countries, third countries other than associated countries and intergovernmental organisations may also be observers without voting rights. The ERIC internal governance structure is flexible, allowing the members to define, in the Statutes, their rights and obligations, the bodies and their competences and other internal arrangements. The ERIC Regulation provides for Member States and associated countries to hold jointly the majority of voting rights in the assembly of members.The liability of the members for the debts of an ERIC may be limited to their respective contributions; flexibility will however be allowed in the Statutes to provide for different liability regimes going above that limit. The applicable law is Union law, the law of the State of the statutory seat or of the State of operation regarding certain administrative, safety and technical matters. The Statutes and their implementing rules must comply with such applicable law. EN 3 EN An ERIC is considered as an international body or organisation in the sense of the Directives on value-added tax, on excise duties and may thus benefit from exemption of VAT and Excise Duties. Being also considered an international organisation within the meaning of the Directive on public procurement, an ERIC may adopt its own procurement rules. An ERIC is set up by an Implementing Decision of the Commission acting on the basis of implementing powers conferred by the Council. The Commission acts upon an application submitted by those Member States, countries and intergovernmental organisations wishing to become founding members of the ERIC. The procedure for the adoption of a Commission decision includes an assessment by independent experts, in particular in the field of the intended activities of the ERIC. The Commission also seeks the opinion of the management committee provided for under Article 20 of the ERIC Regulation (ERIC Committee) which is composed of representatives of the Member States and associated countries. 4. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ERIC REGULATION At the time of writing of the first report on the application of the the ERIC Regulation, seven ERICs were established. These are SHARE-ERIC (Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe)4 hosted first by the Netherlands and then by Germany, CLARIN-ERIC (Common Language Resources and Technology Infrastructure)5 and EATRIS-ERIC ((European Advanced Translational Research Infrastructure in Medicine)6 both hosted by the Netherlands, ESS-ERIC (European Social Survey)7 hosted by the United Kingdom, BBMRI-ERIC (Biobanking and Biomolecular Resources Research Infrastructure)8 hosted by Austria, ECRIN-ERIC (European Clinical Research Infrastructure Network)9 and Euro-Argo ERIC10 both hosted by France. Since then, twelve additional ERICs have been established. These are CERIC-ERIC11 (Central European Research Infrastructure Consortium) hosted by Italy, DARIAH-ERIC12 (Digital Research Infrastructure for the Arts and Humanities) hosted by France, JIV- ERIC13 (Joint Institute for Very Long Baseline Interferometry), hosted by the Netherlands, the European Spallation Source ERIC14, hosted by Sweden, ICOS-ERIC15 (Integrated Carbon Observation System) hosted by Finland, EMSO-ERIC16 (European Multidisciplinary Seafloor and Water Column Observatory), hosted by Italy, LifeWatch ERIC17 (e-Science and Technology European Infrastructure for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Research) hosted by Spain, 4 OJ L 71, 18.3.2011, p. 20. 5 OJ L 64, 3.3.2012, p. 13. 6 OJ L 298, 8.11.2013, p. 38. 7 OJ L 320, 30.11.2013, p. 44. 8 OJ L 320, 30.11.2013, p. 63. 9 OJ L 324, 5.12.2013, p. 8. 10 OJ L 136, 9.5.2014, p.35. 11 OJ L 184, 25.6.2014, p. 49. 12 OJ L 239, 12.8.2014, p. 64. 13 OJ L 363, 18.12.2014, p.156. 14 OJ L 225, 28.8.2015, p. 16. 15 OJ L 303, 20.11.2015, p. 19. 16 OJ L 268, 1.10.2016, p. 113. 17 OJ L 76, 22.3.2017, p. 35 EN 4 EN CESSDA ERIC18 (Consortium of European Social Science Data Archives) and ECCSEL ERIC19 (European Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage Laboratory both hosted by Norway, INSTRUCT-ERIC (Integrated Structural Biology) hosted by the United Kingdom20, EMBRC-ERIC21 (European Marine Biological Resource Centre) hosted by France and EU-OPENSCREEN ERIC22 (European Infrastructure of Open Screening Platforms for Chemical Biology) hosted by Germany. Save for CERIC-ERIC and JIV-ERIC, two European Research Infrastructures that never applied to be included in the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) Roadmap, all other ERICs are included in the ESFRI Roadmap. It should be noted that two ERICs (SHARE-ERIC and ESS-ERIC) have been established for the design, development and implementation of European surveys. Sixteen other ERICs have been established for the development and implementation of distributed research infrastructures in the area of biological and medical sciences, physics, energy sciences, environmental sciences and social sciences and humanities. The European Spallation Source ERIC is the first ERIC that has been established in the physical sciences area and that is responsible for the construction and subsequent operation of the world's most powerful neutron source. ECCSEL ERIC is the first ERIC that has been established in the energy domain. Even though the ERIC Regulation is directly applicable in Member States and requires no transposition, it has been necessary for Member States to adopt appropriate administrative measures and procedures for hosting or becoming a member of an ERIC and for providing the VAT and Excise Duties exemption in accordance with the ERIC Regulation. Also the ERIC as a new type of legal entity has to be assimilated in the national regulatory and administrative systems and many practical questions have to be addressed both by the Commission services as well as the Member States before ERICs can become fully operational. These questions relate to for example to which national registers (for instance the chambers of commerce or a register for associations) the ERICs should be assimilated which in turn has an effect on the status of ERIC staff. In addition, if there is no (national) registration is foreseen, practical operational questions arise for example as how bank accounts and notarial acts could be implemented. Another example within the Commission administrative systems is that there is no special category for the ERIC as a legal entity and this raises questions as concerns their public or private character and their financial capacity as these ERICs are all recently established. As regards associated countries and other third countries to which the ERIC Regulation is not applicable, these countries need to submit a declaration recognising the legal personality and the privileges of an ERIC for possibly hosting (in the case of associated countries) or becoming a member of a specific ERIC. Significant progress was achieved for the EEA countries when the ERIC Regulation was 18 OJ L 149, 13.6.2017, p. 85 19 OJ L 149, 13.6.2017, p. 91 20 OJ L 173, 6.7.2017, p. 47 21 OJ L 51, 23.2.2018, p. 17 22 OJ L 82, 26.3.2018, p. 8 EN 5 EN incoprorated in the EEA by a Joint Committee Decision in March 201523. In particular this allowed for two ERICs to be hosted by Norway24. The administrative and procedural measures taken by the authorities of the Member States and associated countries, the information exchanged at the regular meetings of the ERIC Committee and the clarifications provided by the various Commission services to questions raised by Member States and associated countries representatives have contributed significantly to the facilitation of the implementation of the ERIC Regulation as can be illustrated by the susbtantial increase of established ERICs in the last three years. Moreover, the six meetings of the informal ERIC network initiated by the Commission in which ERICs, ministry representatives and Commission representatives discuss best practices and common challenges did also facilitate the work of the ERIC operators, ministries and Commission services. The ERIC Network is now transformed into the ERIC Forum with a more institutional set-up led by the ERICs which is another step in empowering them to identify and develop collective responses to common challenges and to foster their visibility, impact and sustainability. Notwithstanding these positive developments, a number of open standing issues that were reported in the first Implementation Report are still hampering the deployment of the full potential of the ERIC Regulation. These issues will be addressed in the following paragraphs. 5. CHALLENGES FOR THE IMPLEMENTION OF THE ERIC REGULATION The ERIC Regulation is being implemented at a time when restrictive budgetary measures are taken by Member States and associated countries in order to reduce public deficits. The pooling of resources on a long-term basis necessary for establishment and operation of a proper European Research Infrastructure is therefore a big challenge and becomes even more complicated because of the different time frames for budgetary decision procedures of individual Member States and associated countries involved. This leads to a rather long preparation time to achieve the minimum funding basis for establishing European Research Infrastructures and raises questions about their long term sustainability. This issue is not specific to the ERIC but relates to all European Research Infrastructures25. Better synchronisation, more transparency and alignment between Member States, associated countries and other third countries involved in the prepration for the implementation of a European Research Infrastructure would help greatly to speed up the implementation process and could also improve their sustainability when entering into the operational phase when these Research Infrastructures start offering their services. 23 Decision of the EEA Joint Committee No 72/2015 of 20 March 2015 amending Protocol 31 to the EEA Agreement, on cooperation in specific fields outside the four freedoms (OJ L 129, 19.5.2016, p. 85). 24 These are CESSDA – Consortium of European Social Science Data Archives and ECCSEL – European Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage Laboratory Infrastructure 25 See for example the 2017 Commission Staff Working Document ""Sustainable European Research Infrastructures – A call for action"", https://ec.europa.eu/research/infrastructures/pdf/ri_policy_swd-infrastructures_2017.pdf EN 6 EN The involvement of ministry and funding agencies representatives from the very beginning in the preparation for the establishment of ERICs could help avoiding unnecessary delays at later stages of the preparation phase when siting, financial contributions and commitments from the partners would need to be secured before a formal ERIC application can be made. While the ERIC Regulation does not have time limits in the application process, such delays could negatively impact on the sustainability as budget procedures in the different future members could add even more complexity in setting up the ERIC at a point of time that potential members can support. In addition, the cross-cutting character of many European Research Infrastructures leads in several instances to a more complex decision making process within the future members as several ministries and funding agencies have to be involved for example in the areas of health, research and innovation, marine, environment and energy matters. The VAT and Excise Duties Directives and Procurement Directive provisions that are referred to in the ERIC Regulation requires de facto that within Member States, associated countries and other third countries involved, several ministries including the ones for finance and foreign affairs have to be included in the preparation and approval of the ERIC application. It appears from the experience gained with the establishment of the nineteen ERICs that Member States and associated countries are becoming more aware of this complexity and have adopted internal decision making procedures to organise and speed up the internal approval process. Finally, in the reporting period the United Kingdom notified on 29 March 2017 its intention to leave the Union, pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. Which implies that the Treaties will cease to apply to the United Kingdom from the date of entry into force of the withdrawal agreement or, failing that, two years after the notification, unless the European Council, in agreement with the United Kingdom, decides to extend that period. As a consequence, and without prejudice to any provisions of the withdrawal agreement, Commission Implementing Decisions setting up ERICs only apply until the United Kingdom ceases to be a Member State. Since the notification by the United Kingdom, corresponding wording has been introduced in the pre-amble of Commission Implementing Decisions setting up ERICs in which the United Kingdom is a member or a host26. 6. ROLE OF THE COMMISSION SERVICES The Commission services continue to facilitate the process of implementation of the ERIC Regulation by organising and chairing the ERIC Committee meetings that take place three to four times a year. Apart from providing opinions on formal ERIC applications in compliance with the ERIC Regulation, these meetings serve to provide and exchange of information on ongoing ERIC applications as well as on the internal measures Member States and associated countries have put in place with respect to the decision making for ERIC membership. In addition, Member States and associated countries are informed about timelines for the setting up of individual ERICs, the scale of funding to be expected, services and other activities to be developed and the opportunities for participation. Finally, the ERIC Committee 26 See for example OJ L 173, 6.7.2017, p. 47 second and third recital EN 7 EN started in 2017 to receive presentations from established ERICs on their achievements in science and technology development and the impact they had for the scientific user communities and for policy makers. They also present the way they have overcome the challenges to the operation of the ERIC under the national administrative systems in which they operate. The revised “ERIC Practical Guidelines” have been published in 2015 on the basis of the experiences and lessons learned since 2009 when the ERIC Regulation was adopted. These guidelines will be updated in 2018 in order to reflect recent developments. The Commission services continued to provide clarifications to a wide range of questions from Member States, existing and future ERIC operators and other stakeholders concerning the provisions of the ERIC Regulation such as the legal character of the ERIC, liability of the members, exemption of VAT and excise duties, creation of spin-offs, applicable law in particular for distributed research infrastructures with nodes and personnel in various countries, the liquidation of an ERIC and the role of the national court in that process. The Commission services provided in 2013 templates necessary for the declaration of recognition of an ERIC by third countries and intergovernmental organisations that clarified and simplified the process for those countries to host (only for associate countries) or to become member of an ERIC. Until now, two countries -Israel and Serbia- have provided such a declaration of recognition necessary to become a member of an ERIC. The Commission services continue to play an active role during the preparation of ERIC applications by participating in some of the board meetings and other preparatory meetings of Member States and associated countries clarifying and identifying possible solutions and compromises for points that were raised in discussions between the future partners. These points can for example concern the governance structure of the ERIC, the policies with respect to intellectual property or human resources and other subjects that come up during the finalisation of the provisions of the Statutes fo the ERIC. After the establishment of an ERIC, the Commission services have a more limited role in the ERIC activities which are governed and steered by the ERIC members within the boundary conditions of the ERIC Regulation, the Statutes and Implementing Rules. The Commission services may only act if informed or requested by the members of an ERIC of issues that could seriously jeopardise the achievement of the task of the ERIC or on the basis of the annual reporting by the ERIC to the Commission that is provided for in the ERIC Regulation. 7. INITIAL CONCLUSIONS The ERIC Regulation has proven that it indeed filled the gap between traditional treaty based international organisations and national legal entities for establishing European Research Infrastructures. Due to many commonalities in the provisions of the Statutes of the ERICs concerning for example accession, decision making and the handling of questions such as liability, the ERIC Regulation has facilitated greatly the opportunities for Member States, associated countries and third countries to consider cooperation or joining these European Research Infrastructures. EN 8 EN The procedure for application for the ERIC status and ease of use has improved but could be further optimised as Member States, the scientific community and the Commission services continue to go through a learning process for understanding better the practical implications of using this relatively new legal instrument. However, a number of recurrent issues and policy questions should be addressed if the ERIC legal instrument is truly to be a succesful instrument in support of European Research and these are described in the next chapter. 8. RECURRENT ISSUES AND NEXT STEPS As a result of the experience gained in the application process for establishing an ERIC and the increasing number of ERICs established, several recurrent issues will have to be addressed by Member States and Commission services. They relate to the practices in the Commission and Member States for example on how to register an ERIC in the national legal administrative systems, or in other registers which would enable an ERIC to be recognised by the Commission services for being able to be properly recognised when participating as beneficiary or coordinator of grants and in Member States to open bank accounts and to apply for reimbursement for VAT and excise duties. Similarly, as an ERIC is a public-public partnership, the status of personnel that it employs needs to be clarified in the national administrative systems as this will impact on salary scales, income tax issues and personnel costs for the ERIC. Another recurrent question concerns possible VAT exemption for in-kind contributions to the ERIC as in many cases members of an ERIC prefer to partly contribute in-kind to the ERIC instead of providing cash-contributions. The question of the VAT exemption for ERICs has been discussed at various occasions by the Value Added Tax Committee which resulted in Guidelines that were adopted at its 101st meeting on 20 October 201427. The Guidelines provide that goods or services acquired by representing entities28 shall not benefit from VAT exemption not even if the goods or services are acquired with a view to be delivered to the ERIC as an in-kind contribution. At the same time, the Competitiveness Council in its conclusions of the 5 December 2014 meeting ""invited the Commission and Member States to take appropriate measures to facilitate the use of the ERIC instrument and to stimulate investments in ERICs and other ESFRI Roadmap Infrastructures, for example as concerns in-kind contributions"". The question of the VAT exemption granted to members of an ERIC is again on the agenda of the VAT Committee29 for its meeting in April 2018 for further clarification and guidance. The question of economic-versus non-economic activities remains also to be further clarified as there are increasing demands for ‘innovative’ and ‘socio-economic’ impacts of the activities of the research infrastructures justifying the investments to be made by the members. The socio-economic impact should also be addressed in the context of how ERICs can contribute to the implementation of smart specialisation strategies and contribute 27 Working Paper No 828 Final 28 A ""representing entity"" may represent a Member of an ERIC as regards the exercise of specific rights and the discharge of specified obligations in accordance with Article 9(4) ERIC Regulation 29 Working Paper No 946 EN 9 EN to the socio-economic development of regions and thereby also be eligible for possible support from European Regional Development Funds (ERDF). ERICs play an important role in the defragmentation of European research by creating in a harmonised and structural way European Research Infrastructures which develop and offer services throughout the Union. This increases the transparency concerning the collection of data, access to data and instruments and maintenance of data and services for users. This is not only meant to better support scientific communities but it can also lead to evidence-based policy making in areas such as health, energy, environment and social and cultural innovation policy. ERIC statutory seats are now located in 10 countries and in the near future it can be expected that more Member States and associated countries will host an ERIC. Due consideration should be given by Member States and associated countries when preparing for the implementation of new ERICs to make an effort for achieving in the longer term a more balanced representation as concerns the geographical location of the Statutory Seats throughout the European Union. Research Infrastructures can play an important role in international cooperation, e.g. with the African Union, Latin America and the Carribean countries, Australia, Russia, US, Canada and with the United Nations driven collaborations by providing data, services and access. The Commission is promoting actively ERICs and other European Research Infrastructures in bilateral cooperation mechanisms such as the EU-Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC). The ERIC as a model for a new legal instrument that could help in particular the creation of international distributed research infrastructures was also discussed in the context of the OECD (Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development) GSF (Global Science Forum). However, the GSF decided not to pursue the proposal of the Commission to explore the use the ERIC as a possible model because it was considered to be too complicated. As international research infrastructure consortia could be another important element supporting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, the Commission intends, where appropriate, in the context of international fora invite members of these fora to further explore the possibilities of creating a dedicated legal instrument for establishing such research consortia which could, like the ERIC did in the European Union, fill the gap between the treaty based organisations and national organisations.",123,"Which implies that the Treaties will cease to apply to the United Kingdom from the date of entry into force of the withdrawal agreement or, failing that, two years after the notification, unless the European Council, in agreement with the United Kingdom, decides to extend that period.",0.4757049977779389,5.5672361850738525,1

Since taking office in 1997, the Blair government  continued to propose legislation that is consistent with ""New Labour's"" doctrine of the ""Third Way."" Generally, the ""Third Way"" is characterized as a policy outlook that is business friendly, but still sensitive to social welfare and a goal of greater democratization in the United Kingdom. Examples include legislation that made monetary decisions by the Bank of England independent from government decisions, various proposals for reforming British welfare programs, and different constitutional changes. These changes are outlined in the ""Government"" section of this country review.

Also as noted in the ""Government"" section, the maximum parliamentary term for the House of Commons is five years, but the prime minister may ask the monarch to dissolve Parliament and call a general election at any time. This may occur after a government has lost an important vote, or if the government feels a new election is necessary to increase or maintain its majority in Parliament.

Early in 2001, there was much speculation that Prime Minister Blair would call early parliamentary elections -- on May 3 -- to coincide with previously scheduled local elections. The February outbreak and subsequent spread of foot and mouth disease throughout the United Kingdom, however, caused the prime minister to delay both the local elections and calling parliamentary elections.

Foot and mouth is known to be an extremely infectious viral disease that affects livestock such as cattle, goats, sheep, and swine. It can be readily transmitted from place to place on clothing, shoes, tires, etc., and can even be spread by airborne dust particles. While it is believed to not affect humans - and usually kills only very young or very old animals - it is commercially devastating to farmers. Animals infected with the disease put on less weight, produce less milk, etc., and so become commercially unviable. Since the disease is so highly contagious, the United Kingdom government instituted a policy whereby animals infected with the disease were culled - as were all other animals within the vicinity of those afflicted. By July 2001, there had been about 1,800 confirmed cases of animals infected with foot and mouth, and approximately 3.5 million animals had been culled. In an attempt to halt the spread of the disease, farms with - or near - infected animals were quarantined; travel throughout the countryside was severely curtailed; procedures to disinfect travelers and vehicles were implemented; and the military was called in to assist with the disposal of the culled animals. The British agricultural sector suffered terrible losses - as did the tourism industry and businesses in rural settings, more generally. Prime Minister Blair delayed both the previously scheduled local elections and the call for parliamentary elections because the quarantines and travel restrictions would have made campaigning and voting in the countryside difficult. In addition, the Labour Party did not want to seem uncaring in the face of the farmers' and other rural residents' plight. Eventually, in early May -- when the foot and mouth crisis at last appeared to be coming under a semblance of control -- Blair announced that both local and national elections would be held on June 7. Elections of  2001 In the run-up to the parliamentary elections, Blair's Labour Party focused on further reforming public services, in particular, education, health care, and transportation and other infrastructure. In contrast, the Conservatives (also known as the Tories) ran a campaign based on ""keeping the pound,"" that is, keeping the United Kingdom out of the European Union's Economic and Monetary Union. The elections returned Blair's Labour government to power. With 40.8 percent of the vote, Labour took 413 seats (out of 659) in the House of Commons. Although a decrease from the party's showing in the 1997 elections (down from 43 percent and 419 seats), it was still a landslide victory over second-place finisher, the Conservative Party, which only managed 31.8 percent of the vote and 166 seats (up from 30.7 percent and 165 seats in 1997). The Conservatives' loss was so crushing that party leader, William Hague, resigned in the aftermath of the election. The battle for leadership of the Tories became a long, drawn-out debate over the future direction of the party lasting well into the autumn.  One of the main points of contention was the Conservative Party's position on joining the European Union's Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), and adopting the single European Union (EU) currency, the euro. As noted above, the Conservatives campaigned against EMU membership, but key elements within the party, in particular, certain financial and business interests, are increasingly pro-EMU. Finally, at the party conference in autumn 2001, Ian Duncan Smith was chosen party leader.  Although Ian Duncan Smith was much more opposed to EMU membership than some of the other potential Conservative Party leaders - in particular, Kenneth Clarke, Duncan Smith's election should not necessarily be viewed as a decisive move on the part of the Conservative Party away from the euro. In fact, the party remained split over this issue; the internal divisions became deeper throughout 2002 when the reality of the euro -- as an actual currency -- hit home, both on the European continent and on the British Isles.  In contrast to the Conservative's election troubles, the other main opposition party, Charles Kennedy's Liberal Democrats, fared quite well, capturing 52 seats with 18.3 percent of the vote (up from 46 seats and 16.8 percent in 1997). Six other, largely regional, parties and an independent candidate shared the remaining 9.1 percent of the vote. The Scottish National Party (SNP) won five seats, down from its previous six. ""Playd Cymru"" (the Party of Wales or PC) kept its four seats. David Trimble's more moderate Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) lost ground to the more extremist Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) of Ian Paisley. The UUP only managed six seats at Westminster this time around, down from ten in the 1997 election. In contrast, the DUP won five seats, up from its previous two. The United Kingdom Unionist Party (UKUP) lost its one seat. The moderate nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) of John Hume kept its three seats in the House of Commons, while Gerry Adams' more radically nationalist Sinn Féin (SF) picked up two, for a total of four. These national election results were mirrored in the local elections, with both the Democratic Unionists and Sinn Féin gaining at the expense of the Ulster Unionists and the Social Democrats.  Despite Labour's strong showing, it was worth noting that voter turnout, at approximately 59 percent, was the lowest in a general election since 1918. In other words, more people failed to go to the polls than voted for Labour. This lack of participation may have been the result of many factors, among them the opinion polls in the run-up to the election indicating a commanding lead for Labour. Perhaps people simply did not bother to vote in a race that seemed to have a ""foregone conclusion."" Labour's opponents, primarily the Conservatives, suggested that the level of citizen apathy was indicative of a lack of support for the Blair government and its policies.After the election, the Blair government promised to take seriously the ""mandate"" to reform public services. In keeping with this pledge, the initial agenda submitted to Parliament in the Queen's Speech in June 2001 focused on improving education, the National Health Service, the rail and road systems, the criminal justice system, and many other public services. (By tradition, the Queen delivers the opening speech to Parliament, known as the ""Queen's Speech,"" although the cabinet government writes the text).Presumably for the purpose of better implementing the government's election pledges, Prime Minister Blair reshuffled his cabinet after the election. Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott retained his post - while also taking on the newly-created position of first secretary of state at the Cabinet Office. There, he was placed in charge of coordinating the implementation of the government's election promises. In the aftermath of the foot and mouth disease crisis, the former Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food was, in essence, taken over by a new ministry - Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs. Former leader of the House of Commons, Margaret Beckett, assumed that portfolio. Perhaps the biggest change of all was the replacement of Foreign Secretary Robin Cook with former Home Secretary Jack Straw. Speculation about the cause of this particular change centered on disagreements over the United Kingdom's relations with Europe between then Foreign Secretary Cook and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown. Cook was perceived to be more ""pro-Europe"" than Brown, especially with regard to joining the EU's Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). Many view new Foreign Secretary Straw as more euro-skeptical than Cook.Politics of the European BlocAlthough Labour played down this issue in the run-up to the election, persuading a skeptical public of the benefits of joining the EMU has currently been one of the most difficult challenges facing the Blair government. Along with Denmark and Sweden, the United Kingdom was not (and still is not) a participating member of the EMU. The other twelve EU states, however, do belong to the EMU. As of Jan. 1, 2002, euro banknotes and coins had become legal tender in the EMU countries. Within the next two months of 2002, these states' former currencies were phased out - leaving the United Kingdom, Denmark, and Sweden the last EU members states to retain their national currencies.The Blair government has stated a willingness to join the EMU and adopt the single European currency, the euro, provided the United Kingdom's economy meets five economic tests. These tests, as laid out in October 1997 by Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, were as follows:

1. Are the United Kingdom's and the euro-zone's business cycles and economic structures compatible? That is, are these business cycles largely moving in unison, or not? Are economic structures sufficiently similar that business cycles could be expected to move largely in tandem? Joining the EMU means that U.K. interest rates, as for the entire euro-zone, would be set by the European Central Bank. If the U.K. economy were largely in sync with the EMU members, then the loss of control over this monetary policy instrument would be less of a concern. If, however, the U.K. economy were to experience a downturn, the inability unilaterally to adjust interest rates could be highly problematic.

2. Is the United Kingdom's labor market flexible enough to absorb economic problems that might develop due to EMU membership?

3.Would EMU membership increase investment (both foreign direct investment and investment by U.K. firms) in the United Kingdom?

4. Would EMU membership positively or negatively affect ""the City"" (London), the center of the U.K.'s financial services sector?

5. How will EMU membership affect (un)employment in the U.K.?

Early in 2001, Prime Minister Blair promised that, if re-elected, the Labour government would assess these criteria within two years -- in essence, by a deadline of mid-2003. Provided that the United Kingdom's economy passed these five tests, EMU membership would then be put to the British public in a national referendum. The Blair government has repeatedly stated that the United Kingdom would only join the EMU if a majority of citizens vote in favor.

In addition to the five domestic criteria for EMU membership and the national referendum, the United Kingdom would have to meet the Maastricht Treaty's Growth and Stability Pact criteria. Those criteria, in brief, are as follows:

1. U.K. government debt cannot exceed 60 percent of the state's GDP.

2. The U.K. annual budget deficit cannot exceed three percent of GDP.

3. U.K. inflation can only exceed that of the three lowest-inflation EMU members by 1.5 percent.

4. The U.K. exchange rate must be stable for an agreed-upon period of time.

Unfortunately for the Blair government, the pronounced drop in the value of the euro since its inception (over 15 percent against the pound and over 30 percent against the United States dollar) increased the already strong opposition to joining the EMU. Opinion polls consistently indicated that a majority of the British continued to be highly skeptical, to say the least, about EMU membership. (Note: The rise in the value of the value of the euro against the United States dollar in 2002 and 2003, however, might well shift opinion in favor of EMU inclusion.)

Throughout 2001, the Blair government, in particular, Chancellor Gordon Brown, continued to insist that the United Kingdom would not put EMU membership to a national referendum prematurely, but as promised, the five economic tests of membership would be conducted by the aforementioned deadline of mid-2003. Such statements seemed largely a response to the precipitous, post-election drop in the pound (around 15 percent against the euro) caused, most probably, by financial markets' belief that the Blair government would push for an early referendum on EMU membership. Since the pound was widely believed to be overvalued against the euro (perhaps by 10 to 20 percent), the markets were anticipating a necessary, pre-EMU membership devaluation.

The Blair government's stance on EMU was part of a broader effort by the government to reverse Britain's isolation from European affairs, especially those in the European Union (EU). This effort has been impeded by the continuing situation regarding ""mad cow disease."" Although the EU lifted its 1996 ban on British beef in 1999, the French government continued its ban based on the recommendation of its own Food Safety Agency. The French policy  strengthened anti-European sentiment in the United Kingdom and led to the European Commission taking legal action against the French.Domestic AgendaOn the domestic front, despite dire predictions about the fate of the British pound and the effects of EMU involvement, in early 2002, the British housing market appeared to be in the midst of a boom period. Prices of houses increased at an exponential annual rate and economists and financial pundits wonder if the British housing market was out of control.

Issues surrounding the British monarchy featured prominently in the media in the first half of 2002. In February 2002, Queen Elizabeth's sister, Princess Margaret, died at age 71, following a stroke and associated heart problems. Her death was followed by the death of the Queen Mother in March 2002. The Queen Mother, who lived to the age of 101 years old, had grown increasingly frail in the years leading up to her passing away. In the aftermath of her death, there were some inferences that she had accrued a substantial overdraft by the time she died. In fact, her overdraft was quite modest in comparison with the millions of pounds that she was rumored to have owed the bank. The summer of 2002 promised to be a more optimistic time for the reigning Queen Elizabeth II as she celebrated her Golden Jubilee -- 50 years on the British throne. Although periodic speculation abounds regarding the viability of the British monarchy in a post-colonial world, as was predicted, the Golden Jubilee shored up public support for this enduring institution.

Meanwhile, by mid-June 2002, the Blair government had reportedly lost a great deal of public support. The decrease appeared to be attributable to the ever-rising rate of crime, the perception that the Blair government was ensconced in a game of political spin-doctoring in the media, and the associated view that the Blair government could not be trusted. Whether or nor these perceptions will have long-term political effects, including an increase in support for conservative factions, is yet to be seen. A political scandal involving a friend of Cherie Blair, the wife of the prime minister, did not help to rehabilitate a rather unfavorable view of Blair's government.

Geopolitics and Global Security

Meanwhile, following the terrorist attacks in the United States in September 2001, the government of the United Kingdom pledged support for the global war on terrorism. The United Kingdom also contributed troops toward military action in Afghanistan aimed at removing the ruling Taliban regime, which had sponsored terrorist activities by the al-Qaida group.

In the spring of 2002, as the war in Afghanistan continued and as concerns over terrorism remained in the public purview, European law enforcement agencies were given extensive -- and arguably, indiscriminate -- powers to monitor telephone, internet and e-mail traffic. Detractors have condemned the measures as being some of the most disturbing in a generation; they note that they jeopardize privacy rights in a substantial manner.At the start of 2003, the world was bracing itself for the possibility of a war against Iraq. Blair stated his country would not rush into such a war and that before embarking on any such action, the United Kingdom would seek approval from the United Nations.

Yet, the prime minister in January 2003 faced increasing scrutiny at home as people and parliamentarians wondered about military action when no conclusive evidence against Iraq had been found. As well, other European countries, such as France and Germany, expressed great resistance to the notion of military action against Iraq, especially as the weapons inspections process was ongoing.

In mid-January 2003, Prime Minister Blair asserted that he was committed to disarming Iraq via the United Nations. He said he believed that the United Nations Security Council would back military action against Iraq if it contravened against the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441, which requires the relinquishment of weapons of mass destruction. Blair, however, warned against unilateral voting by any Security Council member. In the event of a veto, Blair reiterated the United Kingdom's right to take military action against Iraq if the country failed to give up its alleged weapons arsenal. By Jan. 20, 2003, up to 31, 000 British troops -- much more than initially expected -- were deployed to the Gulf for a possible war with Iraq.

Internally, the country faced its own turmoil. Also in January 2003, Prime Minister Blair expressed outrage over the death of a policeman who was killed during a terrorism investigation which centered on a discovery of the deadly poison ricin. Three North Africans were detained in a raid; one broke free and stabbed the policeman.

Shortly after the policeman's death, seven persons were detained in another terrorism-related raid at a mosque in north London. Those detained were believed to be tied to terrorist organizations and allegedly linked with the ricin discovery. Six of the seven detained men were North African and the seventh was reported to be east European. Police authorities asserted that the mosque had been instrumental in both the recruitment of terrorists, as well as the support of terrorism in the United Kingdom and abroad. Early investigations showed that some weapons and documents (passports, credit cards and identity cards) were found at the mosque. The significance of these items are not yet known.

Sheikh Abu Hamza, the cleric of the mosque that had been raided, insisted there was no terrorism connection to be found. Hamza, however, was facing expulsion from this very mosque for polemical preaching. The Charity Commission was hoping to have him removed as the agent of the mosque's trust because of his political and vitriolic speeches.

In the wake of the unfortunate death of the British policeman mentioned above, Blair pledged in early 2003 to redouble his country's efforts in fighting militant groups and terrorism. Both groups of detainees were arrested under the aegis of the United Kingdom's Terrorism Act 2000. As the year began, the United Kingdom was conducting a national operation to root out a network of Algerian militants. The United Kingdom's Home Secretary, David Blunkett, expressed complete support for such anti-terrorism efforts.

Meanwhile, the case for a prospective war against Iraq was emerging. As the United States and the United Kingdom faced opposition from various key European states, such as France, Germany, Belgium and Russia, on using military action against Iraq, they were hit with allegations of discredited intelligence. An intelligence report from the United Kingdom, which was also cited by United States Secretary of State Colin Powell to bolster his argument for military action against Iraq at a presentation to the United Nations, was criticized for gross plagiarism. A British academic recognized certain features in the report from an article in a journal called the Middle East Review of International Affairs. Further review showed that various excerpts from a thesis on the build-up to the Gulf War in 1991 by a California doctoral student, Ibrahim al-Marashi, had been copied verbatim and used in the intelligence report. The thesis was later published in the journal identified by the British academic. Other excerpts from the intelligence report were plagiarized from Jane's Intelligence Review. All of the plagiarized material showed consistent grammatical and stylistic errors, making it clearly apparent that the material had been copied directly and without editing.

British government representatives brushed aside criticism of the plagiarized report by stating they had never claimed the material to be original. They also maintained the view that the information was credible, regardless of its sources. Various critics, including some parliamentarians, however, observed that if the information came from open sources, such as published articles and reviews, it could hardly be classified as intelligence in the first place. They also questioned the credibility of the information, given the scandal surrounding its composition.Other problems have also arisen for the government in regard to the report. First, it appears that the information cited was ten years out of date and as such, it hardly represented the current scenario in the area of Iraq. Second, the content itself in the original source had referenced ""opposition groups"" and not terrorists, yet in the plagiarized version, which was used for the intelligence report, the term ""opposition groups"" was replaced with terrorists instead. Both issues have been highly damaging to British intelligence, and by extension, to American intelligence sources as well. Moreover, they contributed to the argument that the ""proof"" about Iraq's weapons arsenal and connections to al Qaida may well have been specious allegations. Indeed, some critics in the United Kingdom have said that the intelligence report demonstrated an attempt to ""mislead"" the public as to the justifications for a war against Iraq. British parliamentarian Glenda Jackson went so far as to say, ""And of course to mislead is a Parliamentary euphemism for lying.""

A peace rally in London in Feb. 15, 2003, like many others held across the world, saw over a million people demonstrate against a prospective war against Iraq. Tony Blair was faced with opposition within his own party and mass opposition among the people of the United Kingdom.

On March 17, 2003, United Kingdom Ambassador to the United Nations Jeremy Greenstock announced that the diplomatic process in relation to Iraq had been concluded and that his country would withdraw its second draft resolution. Despite the unsuccessful effort by the Prime Minister Tony Blair to get a second resolution passed, the United Kingdom intended to pursue military action anyway, albeit under the aegis of the existing United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441, which warned of consequences in the event of Iraqi non-compliance. Although many legal experts disagree as to whether or nor it is possible to preserve the legality of such action by relying on Security Resolution 1441, United Kingdom Attorney General Lord Goldsmith asserted that action against Iraq would be legal, based on the protections of this existing resolution. Contrary opinions by legal experts and the United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan were not addressed by Lord Goldsmith.

Nevertheless, Blair faced a crisis within his own government as a consequence of his choices regarding Iraq. One of Blair's cabinet ministers, Clare Short, the Minister for International Development, announced that she would resign if the United Kingdom involved itself in a war without legitimate United Nations support. Saying that she could not ""stay and defend the indefensible,"" Short explained that if there was no United Nations authority for military action, and if there were no provisions made for the reconstruction of Iraq, she would not uphold a breach of international law, and she would not condone the undermining of the United Nations (as stated in an interview with the BBC). Short also noted that she was quite shocked at Prime Minister Tony Blair's ""recklessness"" in regard to Iraq, and that despite the government's responsiveness to her concerns in private, she had seen no moderating shift in the current rush to war against Iraq.

Short's announcement came as an unwelcome surprise to the rest of the government, and other Cabinet Secretaries criticized her untimely lack of discretion. Nevertheless, Member of Parliament, Andy Reed, also announced that he was resigning as Parliamentary Aide to Environment Secretary, Margaret Beckett. Four other Parliamentary Secretaries -- Members of Parliament who assist Cabinet Ministers -- announced that they would also resign if military action was pursued without sanction from the United Nations. Earlier, Conservative Whip, John Randall, resigned after stating that the case had not yet been made for war. Robin Cook, the country's former Foreign Secretary and Leader of the Commons issued the most significant resignation.Meanwhile, a group of parliamentarians were drafting amendments intended to express support for British troops, while challenging the moral authority of unsanctioned military action against Iraq.Once British forces commenced fighting in Iraq, Blair reported to the British parliament that the war against Iraq was going according to plan. Still, he warned of ""difficult days ahead"" and predicted pockets of resistance in certain areas. In the early days of fighting, British troops had been killed and Blair expressed gratitude for their service. Three helicopters and a Royal Air Force Tornado had been lost in accidents. The Tornado may well have been shot down in friendly fire by a United States Patriot missile. An investigation was pending in this regard. There were also several combat casualties.

As the war ensued, the political developments at home did not bode well for Prime Minister Blair. In a recent vote, several Members of Parliament from his own Labor Party voted against him in regard to Iraq. Although he did not immediately face a threat to his leadership, the number of dissenting voices and the force of active opposition was sure to increase. Many Labor members who had either abstained from the vote on Iraq or agreed to go along with Blair's position for reasons of loyalty, promised that they would not take the path of least resistance again.

While not experiencing the resounding support for the war as his counterpart in the United States, Blair received a spike in support just after the start of the war. That spike lessened as the war progressed and new polls showed that the British public was reacting to inaccurate reporting about the fall of Basra, military casualties, and reports of Iraqi resistance. (Source: Daily Telegraph poll taken on March 30, 2003)

In April 2003, United Kingdom Prime Minister Tony Blair and United States President George Bush met for a summit at Hillsborough Castle on the outskirts of Belfast in Northern Ireland. The summit focused on an administrative agenda for a post-war Iraq. The leaders of both countries concurred on the basis of a three-part strategy: (1) security and infrastructure control by the United States Pentagon; (2) a multi-ethnic Iraqi interim authority; and (3) transition to full Iraqi autonomy. Nevertheless, the details of the plan were largely unspecified and officials from both countries have issued contradictory statements about the role of the United Nations and other international bodies in a post-war Iraq. Middle East peace was also be on the agenda.A Matter of Peace The summit was followed with peace process discussions that included Irish Taoiseach Bertie Ahern and the leaders of the three major Good Friday Agreement parties -- the Ulster Unionists, Sinn Fein and the SDLP. The talks aimed at restoring devolution and would prepare the political agenda for elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly in May. A large anti-war protest was expected with demonstrators coming from all across Ireland to deliver their message to Blair and Bush of dismay regarding the controversial war in the Middle East.Impact of Iraq on Domestic Politics

In local elections held in the United Kingdom in the spring of 2003, Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labour Party suffered its poorest showing since 1979. Labor garnered only 30 percent of the votes cast while the conservative Tories garnered 34 percent themselves. While the Tories hardly commanded a victory, the real story of the election was not the showing of the Tories, but that of Labour. Indeed, despite growing support for Prime Minister Blair during the course of military action against Iraq, the war seems to have caused a backlash of sorts for the Labour party.

In some predominantly Muslim constituencies -- usually a Labour stronghold -- people felt that their voices of protest against the war went unheard. As such, these constituencies did not feel compelled to support Labour. Similarly, in areas such as Bristol, where public services have been severely degraded, the usual Labour party supporters did not feel compelled to show their approval for a party and a prime minister who (in their collective view) appeared to be more focused on international affairs than domestic concerns. For them, improving the lives of people in Basra did not seem to be quite as important as the improvement of the quality of life at home.

Compounding matters was the fact that statistic showed that about 60 percent of people in the United Kingdom did not believe that the war in Iraq would stave off terrorism. Instead, respondents and experts concluded that it has made the United Kingdom more of a target than before. People also feared that no weapons of mass destruction would be found -- the primary impetus for taking pre-emptive action in the first place. Should such weapons be found in the future, the discovery would be helpful to Blair, and by extension, his party. In the meanwhile, people have also been concerned that the war has damaged inter-European relations.

The convergence of all these factors were believed to have contributed to the abysmal showing of Labour in these local elections.Post-War Issues

In May 2003, following the cessation of military action in Iraq, United Kingdom International Development Minister, Clare Short (mentioned above), resigned from the cabinet of the Prime Minister because of the United Nations' minor role in a post-war Iraq. In her resignation statement, Short blasted Blair for breaking promises and assurances about the role of the United Nations. Short also accused Blair of being unduly concerned about his political legacy and referred to his government as excessively controlled.  Some political insiders suggested that Blair had already intended to sack Short. In the aftermath of the war, the United Kingdom's coalition partner -- the United States -- presented a resolution to the United Nations Security Council in regard to Iraq. The resolution would suspend sanctions; legalize the sale of oil -- the revenues of which would be used for reconstruction purposes -- and transition the Iraqi ""oil-for-food"" program into the realm of United States control. The resolution would also ensure that products of Iraq and associated proceeds would be immune from judicial and administrative challenges. The interests of any entities not associated with the United States-led coalition in Iraq would be removed. The passage of the resolution would also facilitate the eventual involvement of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Although the United Nations would be involved in appointing a coordinator to help with reconstruction efforts, this role would be nominal in its authority. Moreover, any role for United Nations weapons inspectors would be officially eliminated. The resolution would retroactively convey international approval to the United States-led coalition's endeavors in Iraq. The list of propositions exceeded the degree to which states opposing the war, such as France and Russia, have been willing to compromise. Meanwhile, the United Kingdom -- the United States' main coalition partner -- was believed to have found the tone of the resolution rather antagonistic. That very tonality, however, might have been intended to compel international concurrence on the issue of Iraq. As questions increased about the credibility of its intelligence on Iraq in mid-2003, Downing Street was hit by another scandal. David Kelly, a scientist called to give testimony before a parliamentary inquiry panel on Iraq intelligence, was found dead from an apparent suicide. Kelly had been accused by panel members of being an informant who gave information to the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), which ultimately led to allegations that Downing Street had ""sexed up"" its dossier on Iraq. The matter led to a nasty row between the BBC and Prime Minister Tony Blair's communications director, Alistair Campbell. Kelly's family said the accusations by the panel had led to Kelly becoming very despondent. The actual cause of the apparent suicide, however, remained unconfirmed, but questions still arose as to whether pressure placed on Kelly by the panel members contributed to the suicide. The BBC was not exempt from accountability and admitted that Kelly was the principal source of its allegations against the British government. As well, it was revealed that the account offered by Kelly to the inquiry panel on Iraq intelligence did not precisely correspond with claims made by the BBC. Kelly told the panel that he could not believe that he was responsible for the claim that the 45-minute deployment of banned weapons had been overstated. The 45-minute claim was precisely why the government was accused of inflating the evidence in the dossier. The disconnection between Kelly's account to the inquiry panel and what the BBC actually reported has evoked questions of the BBC's credibility. Although the BBC maintained it ""accurately interpreted and reported"" the information conveyed by Kelly, several board members resigned as a result of the episode.  A judicial inquiry regarding the apparent suicide by Kelly was set to begin in early August. Prime Minister Tony Blair said his government would fully cooperate with the inquiry.  Faced with the media firestorm both at home and across the Atlantic regarding allegations of spurious intelligence, however, Prime Minister Tony Blair began to suffer politically. At home, the general consensus has been emerging that the prime minister overstated the evidence about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Indeed, a poll by ICM for the Daily Mirror last week showed that about two-thirds (66 percent) of those questioned believe that Blair misrepresented the facts -- and either knowingly or unknowingly -- misled the British public before sending troops to fight a war in Iraq. A YouGov poll for the Daily Telegraph this week showed that 68 percent of those questioned believed that the government was not trustworthy on issues related to Iraq. The same poll also showed that over 70 percent of those polled thought it was wrong of the government to have allowed Kelly's identity to become public, thus subjecting the mild-mannered scientist to the stress of the media spotlight. The turmoil seemingly led to slide in the value of the British pound, possibly demonstrating a general climate of political uncertainty.By early 2004, however, the judicial inquiry into Kelly's death exonerated the Blair government and heavily criticized the BBC for its coverage of the situation.  In May 2004, reports of abuse surfaced implicating United Kingdom forces in the mistreatment of Iraqi detainees.  At first, officials denounced the incriminating photographs claiming they were inauthentic.  With Downing Street's confirmation of a Red Cross report from February 2004 raising allegations of abuse and mistreatment, Prime Minister Tony Blair apologized in an interview on French television and promised punishment under military rules of those responsible. In London, Defense Secretary Geoff Hoon was expected to respond to questions by Members of Parliament in the House of Commons.  The incriminating pictures, however, were later determined to be of questionable credibility.  Relations with European UnionThe war in Iraq had been an illustration of the United Kingdom's ""special relationship"" with the United States, which, in and of itself, strained relations between the United Kingdom and other European countries.Meanwhile, the United Kingdom was still faced with the possible prospect of a referendum on EMU inclusion in 2003. The government continued to promise a referendum on this issue while cabinet ministers studied the United Kingdom's Treasury analysis about the possible implications of adopting the euro currency. One significant difference that has shifted perspectives on EMU inclusion has been the increasing strength of the euro against the United States dollar. By mid-2003, the British government decided to delay a  possible date for a referendum on euro adoption.  Ultimately, the decision regarding the adoption of the euro and disbanding the British pound has been a significant constitutional matter affecting notions of sovereignty.In June 2004, early indications from the European Union (EU) parliamentary elections showed there had been a record low turnout of only 44.2 percent for the EU. Early indications also showed that turnout among the 10 new member states was even lower than the overall average at only 26 percent. Insofar as the actual election results were concerned, gains for opposition parties across Europe appeared to be on the horizon. Early results in the United Kingdom suggested that Tony Blair's Labour Party lost 10 percent of their expected voter share while the Conservatives fared little better, losing about 6 percent of the expected vote share. Meanwhile, the Independence Party, known for its skepticism toward the EU, won its first representative at the EU Parliament.Domestic SceneOn the domestic political scene, in late 2004, following the resignation of David Blunkett from the cabinet post of home secretary, former British Education Secretary Charles Clarke was named as his replacement.  Meanwhile, Ruth Kelly took over as education secretary.  At the age of 36, Kelly became the youngest Cabinet minister in British history.Elections of 2005

In April 2005, Prime Minister Tony Blair called a snap election to be held a month later in May 2005. On May 5, 2005, citizens of the United Kingdom went to the polls to elect its new government. Voters were to select members of parliament in 645 constituencies. The party that secured the majority in parliament was expected to form the government. Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Labour Party hoped to secure a third consecutive term in office. Turnout was predicted to be around 60 and was just over 61 percent in actuality.

Leading up to the elections, both Tony Blair's Labour Party and Michael Howard's Conservatives (or Tories) were expected to focus on matters pertaining to the economy. Whereas the Labour Party concentrated its campaign platform on the regeneration of the inner cities, the Conservatives chose to highlight tax incentives and a plan benefiting business interests.  The Conservatives also wielded an anti-immigration platform. For its part, however, Charles Kennedy's Liberal Democrats decided to direct their efforts to the war in Iraq. Indeed, they repeatedly called for a full public inquiry into the Iraq war, and they also demanded that the attorney general's full legal advice on the war be released to the public. The demand by the Liberal Democrats came after a newspaper reported on a memorandum that allegedly raised questions about the legality of the war. The leaked memorandum was eventually published, and both main opposition parties stepped up their attacks on the prime minister for his perceived deceit over the legal implications of the Iraq war. Moreover, the media's attention remained almost singularly fixated on the matter.

Despite the preoccupation by the media with this issue of the war, Prime Minister Tony Blair launched a rigorous campaign across the country on the basis of his party's economic record and with a focus on domestic concerns. To his benefit, some voters who had been surveyed expressed scant interest in prioritizing Iraq as an election issue. Instead, they generally noted their decisions would be far more broad-based. Still, Blair and the Labour Party were faced with the prospect of a diminished majority in parliament due to the Muslim and pacifist voters for whom the war was a key concern.

Charles Kennedy's campaign schedule across the country was slightly more strenuous than Tony Blair's and garnered much positive attention. As the only major party to oppose the war, the Liberal Democrats also hoped to gain from the fact that they were the only main political party to stake out unambiguous anti-war terrain. Indeed, Kennedy and the Liberal Democrats were positioned uniquely to frame the election as a ""referendum on the war."" Kennedy's Liberal Democrats were also trying to push a strong challenge to the Tories in conservative areas where the Labour Party was not a factor.

Meanwhile, even though the Conservative Tories attempted to capitalize on the Iraq memorandum scandal, the fact that Howard's party did not actually oppose the war put them at a comparative disadvantage among the anti-war crowd. As such, Howard's Conservative Tories were hoping to yield positive results from their aforementioned anti-immigrant campaign. They also hoped to consolidate support in the south and southwest, where they have traditionally done well,  despite the challenge from the Liberal Democrats.

Polls taken on the eve of the election in late April 2005 showed Blair's Labour Party commanding a lead over his opponents, but the same polls showed he might ultimately end up with a smaller majority in parliament. Some polls showed Howard's Tories holding steady while others showed the party losing ground somewhat. Finally, Kennedy's Liberal Democrats, according to the polls, showed increased support. A full 25 percent of those surveyed just prior to the election, however, said they were still undecided.

As exit polling data was released at the close of election day, it appeared that Tony Blair and the Labour Party could potentially assume an historic third term in office, albeit with a diminished majority in parliament. The exit poll trends held steady and in the end, Blair and the Labour Party garnered approximately 36 percent of the votes cast and held a majority in parliament with 355 seats. The Conservative Tories of Michael Howard had about 33 percent of the votes cast and a slightly enlarged presence in parliament with 197 seats. The Liberal Democrats had about 22.2 percent of the votes cast and 62 seats in parliament. Kennedy and the Liberal Democrats were confident they had met their goals of a better overall election performance than the last time. (Note: At the time of writing, six seats were undeclared).

Some of the key members of Blair's cabinet, such as Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, held their constituencies. But election night was also filled with several surprises. Ousted Labour Party member George Galloway, who had been an outspoken  opponent to the war in Iraq, defeated Labour Member of Parliament Oona King in the Bethnal Green constituency. The Conservative Tories took back Putney and Wimbledon from Labour, secured Shipley, and seemed to have had a somewhat better showing in parts of London. The Tories also took Newbury from the Liberal Democrats. At the same time, an Independent grabbed Labour's safest Welsh seat of Blaenau Gwent. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats held on to Cheadle despite attacks by the Tories, and were victorious over Labour in key constituencies, such as Birmingham Yardley, Manchester Withington, and Cardiff Central.

Blair actually increased his vote share in his constituency of Sedgefield to win his seat convincingly. However, one of his opponents was the father of a soldier killed in Iraq. He ran against Blair purely to protest the war, its (perceived)  questionable legality, and the loss of soldiers like his son. For Blair's part, his sober victory speech given at Sedgefield reflected his cognizance that Labour's overall victory was a muted one. Blair and the Labour Party's success has been likely due to his stewardship of the economy, but the diminished majority in parliament made it apparent that Iraq  was a factor in the election outcome. This was something Blair took time to acknowledge in his speech thanking the voters for returning him as the Sedgefield Member of Parliament, and possibly as the head of government. He said, ""It seems clear ... that also the British people wanted the return of a Labour government but with a reduced majority.""

Indeed, Blair went on to resume the leadership over government as the only Labour leader to ever achieve three consecutive election wins.  But Blair also bore the responsibility of presiding over the lowest vote share for a ruling party in recent history.As a result, some political experts initiated a debate as to how long Tony Blair would stay on as prime minister before he turned the reins over to a successor -- more than likely to be Foreign Minister Gordon Brown.  Before such changes were made, however, the immediate business was the formation of a new government.  A day after the election -- which was also Blair's birthday -- he was asked by Queen Elizabeth II to form a new government and went on to orchestrate a cabinet reshuffle. 

In a similar case of ""mixed results,"" even as the Conservatives could claim they had increased their popularity and seats in parliament, they were also faced with the reality that it was one of the worst performances for their party. The day after the election Tory leader Michael Howard said he would step down in order to make room for younger leadership of the party. 

Likewise,  Kennedy and the Liberal Democrats achieved both positive and negative election results.  Whereas Kennedy's Liberal Democrats were not able to pick off certain key targets in Tory strongholds, they were able to enjoy the achievement of an overall improved election performance and increased popularity among voters. 

Meanwhile, in Northern Ireland,  there were fears that the moderate parties may be routed.  Speculation abounded as to whether David Trimble of the Ulster Union would hold his Upper Bann seat.  This news was later confirmed.  Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party picked up Trimble's seat and enjoyed other gains.  Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams held on to his West Belfast seat with an increased vote share.  In general, Sinn  Fein retained their seats. Largely due to the defeat of David Trimble and the Ulster Union in Northern Ireland, the prospects for peace, set forth by the Good Friday Agreement, were very much in doubt.  Trimble, who resigned due to his party's showing, noted that the people had voted against progress on the peace process and ""for stalemate."" The depressed prospects for peace, however, were nont long-lasting as several months later , the IRA officially announced an end to its armed campaign after three decades of violence.  See the section  titled ""Northern Ireland"" below, as well as the Appendix: Northern Ireland,""  for more  details. Developments in the MonarchyIn the backdrop of these political developments was the April 2005 wedding of Heir Apparent Prince Charles to Camilla Parker-Bowles -- a rather controversial figure since the death of the mother of the Prince's children, Princess Diana.  After Bowles wed Prince Charles, she was to be known as the Princess Consort.  Whether or not this position automatically makes her Queen when the Heir Apparent accedes to the throne is a matter of discussion.Terrorist Attacks in LondonAt 8:51 a.m. GMT on July 7, 2005, the first in a series of blasts exploded through London's transport network.  The first blast occurred about 100 yards from Liverpool Underground Station, in the direction of Algate East.  Five minutes later between Russell Square and King's Cross Station, there was another explosion on a train.  At 9:17 a.m., a third blast occurred at Edgware Road Station. Then at 9:47 a.m., there was a fourth blast -- this time on a double decker bus at the corner of Tavistock Square and Upper Woburn Place.  All the explosions on the Underground appeared to have involved the Circle Line or possibly the Central Line.  Both are older Underground lines located closer to ground level in the tube system.

About 50 people were reported to have been killed and more than 700 injured.  It was believed that several people died at each of the four blast sites although most appeared to have died in the blast on a train between Russel Square and King's Cross Station.  It was unknown as to how many people died in the bus blast.

On the ground in London, emergency services said they had treated scores of injured patients.  The types of injuries ranged from minor lacerations and smoke inhalation to more critical cases of burns, amputations, fractured limbs and  chest injuries.  While Underground train services were suspended for at least a day, bus service resumed within London's Zone One, and mainline train service was open. As well, many of the Metropolitan Police officers who had been sent to Scotland for the G-8 summit were expected to return to London. 

When the explosions first occurred within the Underground, many early reports suggested they were due to a power surge.  These initial assumptions were laid aside as it became increasingly clear that the blasts were the work of terrorists.  Officials noted there had been no advance warning.  They also said they were trying to determine if the blast on the bus had been the work of a suicide bomber, although they noted it could very easily have been a simple explosive device left on the bus. 

Although there was no confirmation as to the validity of its claims, a hitherto unknown group called  Secret Organization Group of al-Qaida - Jihad Organization in Europe claimed responsibility in a statement posted on an Islamist website.  The group stated that its motivation for the attacks was to avenge the ""massacres"" committed by the United Kingdom in Iraq and Afghanistan.  It also expressed the hope that the United Kingdom was ""burning with fear and panic.""United Kingdom Prime Minister Tony Blair responded by promising,  ""the most intense police and security service action to make sure we bring those responsible to justice.""He also made note of the contrast between the purpose of the G-8 summit he was attending and the purpose of the terrorists responsible for the London attacks.  In this regard, he said, ""It's particularly barbaric that this has happened on a day when people are meeting to try to help the problems of poverty and Africa.""  The prime minister then returned to London from the summit, vowing, however, that the meetings would go on. 

Also in the United Kingdom, the British Monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, expressed deep shock at the events, and conveyed her deepest sympathies to those affected.  She also ordered the Union flag to fly at half mast over Buckingham Palace.  London's Mayor, Ken Livingstone, who was in Singapore for the announcement of London as the venue for the 2012 Olympics, extolled the strength of London's diverse people who have lived in harmony and who would not be divided by the ""cowardly attack.""  From Vatican City, Pope Benedict described the blasts as ""barbaric acts against humanity"" and sent a message of condolence to the Archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Cormac Murphy O'Connor.  United States President George W. Bush, who was in Gleneagles in Scotland for the G-8 summit, said: ""The war on terror goes on.""Mohammed Sidique Khan, Hasib Mir Hussein, Shehzad Tanweer and Germaine Lindsay were the four men identified as the suicide bombers responsible for the July 2005 terrorist attacks in London. A report in the media revealed that MI5 had investigated  Mohammad Sidique Khan, but concluded that he was not a threat.  Nevertheless, no official inquiry was convened on the question of why the bombers were not tagged as threats by United Kingdom's security services.  Instead, attention was focused on new anti-terrorism measures and legislation. These new laws included the following:

-Outlawing ""acts preparatory to terrorism""-New offence of indirect incitement to commit terrorist acts-New law for those providing or receiving terrorist training

Meanwhile, as the investigation about the attacks were ongoing, Police Commissioner Sir Ian Blair expressed anticipation about a  ""clear al-Qaeda link.""  As well, the authorities were searching for those who supported, financed, or armed the attackers. In another development, an Egyptian chemistry student, Magdi El-Nashar, was detained in Cairo in connection with the attacks.  Finally, explosives were found in a house in Leeds -- the town where most of the July 2005 suicide bombers lived.

In another development, Chatham House released a report in mid-July 2005  which said in its conclusion: ""There is no doubt that the situation over Iraq has posed particular difficulties for the UK, and for the wider coalition against terrorism."" Although it did not suggest that the issue of Iraq laid at the heart of the London attacks, it intimated that there was a connection.  The report also noted that while the United Kingdom has been carrying out counter-terrorism policy in tandem with the United States, it was not an equal decision-maker in the relationship.  Instead, directives were being driven by the United States. Two weeks after the fatal bombings across London's transport network, an apparent attempt to replicate those attacks ensued on July 21, 2005 on three Underground trains and one bus.  The bombs detonated but failed to ignite, thus sparring London of further tragedy. Four suspects fled the scene and authorities issued images of the men thought to be responsible for attempted suicide attacks.  Three men were arrested under the Terrorism Act in connection with the attempted attacks and were being questioned.  As the days wore on, all the apparent attempted suicide bombers had been apprehended along with several other suspects.

Meanwhile, a day after the attempted bombings, a man was shot dead at the Stockwell Underground Station after failing to respond to police who were pursuing him. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Ian Blair said at a news conference that the shooting was part of anti-terrorist operations. Days later, however, the authorities admitted that the man killed, Jean Charles de Menezes, was a Brazilian national who was not connected to any terrorist activities.  Sir Ian Blair apologized to the man's family, characterizing his untimely death as a ""tragedy,"" but also warning that more people could similarly be shot as the police searched for the suspects.

At the diplomatic level, Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim met Foreign Office officials in London to seek an explanation for the killing of the 27-year old electrician. He noted that while Brazil stood in solidarity with the United Kingdom against terrorism, it deplored the loss of innocent life.  He also said that Foreign Minister Jack Straw had promised a full investigation.Death of a Political IconIn early August 2005, former British Cabinet Minister and Leader of the Commons Robin Cook died after collapsing in north-west Scotland. He was pronounced dead at Raigmore Hospital in Inverness. As news of his untimely death spread, friends and colleagues paid tribute to the parliamentarian who was known for his strong opinions on the political issues of the day. Prime Minister Tony Blair characterized Cook as ""an outstanding, extraordinary talent"" in a statement released by Downing Street. Michael Howard, the leader of the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom said: ""He is a very great loss. He was someone who made an immense contribution to our political life."" Charles Kennedy, leader of the Liberal Democrats said: ""Scottish, British and international politics have lost a good and gifted man.""

Robin Cook first became a Member of Parliament for Edinburgh Central in 1974. He was appointed the shadow Health Secretary in 1989, and became shadow Trade and Industry Secretary in 1992. Two years later in 1994, he became the shadow Foreign Secretary and he held that position until the 1997 election. With the Labour Party's landslide victory, he then held the portfolio for the Foreign Secretary within the British Cabinet. In 2001, there was a reshuffle and he took on the job of Leader of the Commons instead, with Jack Straw replacing him at the Foreign Office. Cook's strenuous opposition to the war in Iraq led to his resignation from that post in 2003 (noted above). On the matter of the Iraq war, Cook notably said, ""I cannot support a war without international agreement or domestic support."" He then continued to be a strong critic of Tony Blair's foreign policy from the backbench of the British Parliament.Regarding the MonarchyApril 21, 2006 marked Queen Elizabeth II's 80th birthday. The British monarch celebrated this personal milestone at Windsor Castle.  Thousands of well-wishers were on hand to greet her while Irish Guards played the song, ""Happy Birthday"" in the background.  She was scheduled to join her family for a private birthday dinner hosted by her son and Heir Apparent, Prince Charles.State of the Blair GovernmentMay 2006 was marked by a cabinet shakeup in the United Kingdom.The changes appeared intended to highlight Prime Minister Tony Blair's continued governing power, even in the face of scandals and other negative news coverage.Opposition leaders, however, said that cabinet shakeups could not mask the need for a new government altogether.

The most significant change centered on the dismissal of the country's Foreign Secretary.  It was believed that growing philosophical differences and concomitant tensions between Prime Minister Tony Blair and Foreign Secretary Jack Straw precipitated the move.  Indeed, there were reports that Straw had privately conveyed his concerns about the Iraq war.  As well, he publicly rebuked the notion of military action against Iran, and even went so far as to characterize the United States' contingency plans for a tactical nuclear strike against Iran as ""completely nuts.""  Prime Minister Blair replaced Straw with the head of the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Margaret Beckett.  Her appointment was notable since she became the first woman to hold the Foreign Affairs portfolio in the British government. 

Another important change was the dismissal of Home Secretary Charles Clarke.  It was believed that Clarke's dismissal was due to a politically-heated and particularly damaging imbroglio involving a failure to deport foreign criminals.  That issue involved the government's acknowledgment that over 1,000 foreign criminals slated for deportation were not screened before freeing them from prison.  Although Prime Minister Blair initially expressed support for Clarke, he subsequently made the decision to dismiss his Home Secretary saying, ""I felt that it was very difficult, given the level of genuine public concern, for Charles to continue."" Clarke was replaced with Defense Secretary John Reid, while Des Browne, Chief Secretary at the Treasury,  took on the Defense portfolio in his stead. 

Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott's responsibilities were curtailed after his scandalous admission that he had an affair with a secretary. He was, however, allowed to keep his title. 

The cabinet shuffle occurred on the heels of local elections, which were largely regarded as a referendum on the Blair government.  The election resulted in a poor showing by the Labour Party and led to some calls for Prime Minister Blair to step down.  In those elections, Labour suffered something of a rout -- exemplified by a loss of seats along with significant gains for the Conservative Party. 

Within the Labour Party, there was increasing factionalism between the Blairists and standpoint Labour members.  Gordon Brown, the Treasury Head and the de facto ""heir apparent"" to Blair, warned that in order to stem the political losses to Labour in the long term, voters' concerns regarding crime, terrorism, employment and financial security had to be addressed in the very near future. Policy issues aside, there were demands for a strong shift in the direction of the party itself. Frank Dobson, a former cabinet secretary, called for new management of the party in short order.  Even more radical were the emerging calls for Prime Minister Blair to step down from office.  In fact, cabinet secretary John Reid said that there was a left-wing plot to oust Blair out of his leadership role.  Certainly, there were reports that approximately 50 Labour parliamentarians issued a letter to Blair asking him to identify a departure date, for the purpose of ending the damaging speculation about the leadership of the party. Of course, the counterpoint argument was that changing the leadership would be terribly damaging at a time when party unity was needed. On September 5, 2006, a week after British Prime Minister Tony Blair rejected the notion of a timetable for his departure, 17 parliamentarians from the Labour Party dispatched a letter asking him to resign. The call for Blair to resign had been increasing in mid-2006, prompting news that Blair might step down within 12 months.  This timetable was deemed acceptable by several parliamentarians who signed a statement to that effect.  However, another cadre of Labour parliamentarians said that Blair's resignation should be immediate.

These developments came amidst revelations about an apparent leaked memorandum, which suggested that Blair would embark on a farewell tour. The memorandum was reported to have been crafted by a number of Blair's allies, including  pollster Philip Gould, and said, ""He needs to go with the crowd wanting more.""  The document emerged around the same time that a Populus poll was published showing that Conservatives were advancing strong support over Labour, regardless of whether or not Blair stayed on in power.

On September 7, 2006, British Prime Minister Tony Blair confirmed that he will step down as prime minister within a year.Speaking at a London school, Blair said, ""The next party conference in a couple of weeks will be my last party conference as party leader."" Some members of Blair's Labour Party suggested that Blair would announce a timetable for stepping down from office in early 2007, followed by a handover of power in May.  However, others noted that no  specific timeline had been decided other than the general timeline of 12 months.In late September 2006, Blair bid his party goodbye in final swansong speech as Labour Party leader.  In his speech before the party faithful, he declined to give a precise date of departure, instead focusing on the accomplishments of the party while he was at the helm. In the meanwhile, relations within the Labour Party remained rather fractious over the issue of Blair's tenure as prime minister, as well as the question of succession.  In this latter regard, Blair and his possible successor, Gordon Brown, were reported to have had a contentious discussion on the prospective schedule for the prime minister's  departure.  Brown apparently advocated a faster departure, ahead of elections in Scotland, Wales and England, while Blair allies urged a later departure date. The matter led to something of a conflict between respective Blair and Brown camps within the Labour Party, as well as a spate of resignations from members of government.  Northern Ireland Developments in 2006 In 2006, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern traveled to Northern Ireland to reveal their plan for restoring devolution.  To this end, they gave Northern Ireland Assembly members a deadline of November 24, 2006  to establish power-sharing governance. May 2006 marked the first time since October 2002 that Northern Ireland's politicians took their seats at the Stormont assembly.  There was no expectation that a power-sharing executive government would be immediately formed.  Still, it was hoped that the process of convening Assembly Members at Stormont would at least facilitate the possibility of an agreement being forged ahead of the November 24, 2006 deadline.  Essentially, politicians were given six weeks to form an executive.  Should the six week period pass without agreement, they would be given another 12 weeks to do so.  But if the November deadline was reached without resolution, the salaries of Assembly Members would be halted. Ultimately, implementation of the Good Friday Agreement was at stake. September 2006 saw the DUP begin an internal consultative process by which it was considering whether or not to share power with Sinn Fein. A month later, intensive multi-party talks were convened at St. Andrews in Scotland aimed at moving the sides toward a commitment to devolution.  A deadline of November 10, 2006 was set by which all Northern Ireland parties were to respond to the St. Andrews Agreement. This new deadline was followed by the unveiling of a roadmap to devolution, in which the date March 26, 2007 was set for the establishment of a new operational executive. Also in October 2006, an anticipated meeting between Gerry Adams and Ian Paisley at Stormont was postponed after the DUP insisted on a pledge of policing in Northern Ireland.  This issue came to the fore again at the close of 2006 when Sinn Fein announced that it was convening a special meeting to discuss possible republican support for policing. Such support would essentially remove a major obstacle to the devolution process.  In November 2006, in keeping with the aforementioned deadline, a transitional assembly was established.  The transitional assembly was to be in effect until the close of January 2007.  As well, March 2007 was confirmed as the time  when elections would be held for the new executive.  Proceedings to hear ministerial choices of the DUP and Sinn Fein were interrupted when an apparent loyalist assassin, Michael Stone, tried to enter into the compound at Stormont.  He was subsquently charged with attempted murder.  Terror Attacks Foiled in United Kingdom  On Aug. 10, 2006, British authorities announced that they had foiled an attempt by terrorists to bring down several airliners, ultimately killing thousands of people.  British police said that following a lengthy probe starting more than six months earlier, over 20 people had been arrested in connection with the terrorist plot, which, according to reports, involved approximately 10 airliners traveling from the United Kingdom to the United States.  Details emerging about the plot suggested that the terrorists intended to carry concealed bomb-making materials with them in their carry-on luggage and, presumably, construct and detonate the bombs in-flight over the Atlantic.  A day after the attacks were reported to have been foiled, Italian authorities detained around 40 suspects for questioning in connection with the planned terrorist attacks.  A few days later, Pakistani authorities also arrested several people in that country, including two British nationals with Pakistani roots, in connection with the apparent terrorist plot.  In the United Kingdom, even as suspects in custody were being interrogated, British police were still carrying out investigations, including the search for evidence in wooded areas of Buckinghamshire.

While United States spokespersons and media quickly speculated that the terrorist plan was, perhaps, carried out by the notorious Islamic militant group, al-Qaida, British counterparts were far more reticent about expressing ideas about who might be responsible.  British analysts acknowledged that the terrorist plan bore the hallmark of typical al-Qaida operations -- complex and coordinated orchestration of attacks intended to be extensive in scope and yielding maximum carnage.  That said, they suggested that if those responsible had not been trained at al-Qaida camps, they were at least likely to be al-Qaida inspired.

While little information was initially released about the individuals arrested, it appeared that many of them were British-born Muslims, many of  Pakistani ethnicity.  Two of the suspects were reported to have traveled to Pakistan and later received money from a source there.  Another suspect was believed to be a worker at an Islamic charity.  Yet another was reported to be an employee of Heathrow Airport with an all-area access pass. Two suspects apparently left ""martyrdom tapes"" typical of Islamic suicide bombers. Overall, it was surmised that this group of would-be terrorists were much like the self-radicalized types who carried out the attacks on London's Underground in July 2005. (Although largely self-radicalized, even that group had links to al-Qaida, as was discovered some time after the attacks took place.)

It was also revealed that British police had ideally wanted to continue its investigation further, in order to glean even more information.  However, when signs began to indicate that the terrorists were ready to activate their plan, the police had no choice but to immediately arrest those believed to be conspiring to carry out the terrorist attacks. Apparently following a number of arrests in Pakistan, information came to light suggesting that a terrorist act was imminent. Following the arrests on Aug. 10, 2006 came the revelation that while as many people were detained as possible, there was no guarantee that all members of the terrorist enclave had been taken into police custody.  With a possible security threat still in the offing, the governments of the United Kingdom and the United States immediately raised their security threat indices to the highest levels.  In addition,  transportation authorities in the United Kingdom and the United States immediately instituted draconian measures on air travel.

In the United Kingdom, all hand luggage was immediately banned, forcing travelers to place only identity documents, cash, credit cards and keys into clear plastic bags during travel. In the United States, international travelers were to be subjected to stringent security procedures, while all travelers on overseas and domestic flights were prohibited from carrying all liquid, lotion, cream and gel-like substances in their hand luggage.  These policies were instituted in response to revelations that the would-be terrorists intended to detonate a liquid-based explosive, composed of a sports drink and peroxide-based paste.  Ignition of the explosion could, theoretically, be achieved using an electrical device such as a cell phone.

Air transport across the world was compromised.  London's Heathrow Airport -- the world's busiest airport and the connection hub for global carriers -- was at the center of the plot.  As such, air carriers flying from or to Heathrow cancelled or delayed flights.  From Europe in the east and west across the Atlantic to the United States, repercussions were felt as air traffic came to a halt.  At the same time, at airports where flights were still departing and arriving, passengers were dealing with particularly lengthy security lines.

While British Home Secretary John Reid acknowledged on Aug. 13, 2006 that the new regime of security restrictions was taking a particularly difficult toll on the air travel industry, he noted that it was necessary given the ""substantial threat"" posed by terrorists.  Still, a day later, the United Kingdom's threat level was downgraded from critical to severe, indicating that an attack was now considered ""highly likely"" rather than ""imminent.""  The change was made by the Joint Terrorism and Analysis Centre on the basis of recent intelligence. The downgraded status indicated the possibility that some of the security restrictions might be eased, such as the re-introduction of limited hand luggage.

In the midst of these developments, a British Airways flight from Heathrow Airport en route to New York was forced to turn back when a mobile phone, which has been officially banned, rang on board.

Also on Aug. 13, 2006, Home Secretary Reid declared that the recent terrorist plot -- involving the use of liquid explosives on trans-Atlantic flights -- was among at least four such plots, which  had been thwarted in the last year since the July 7, 2005 attacks on London's transit system.  Reid, however, noted that al-Qaida activities had been operational in the United Kingdom as far back as 2000.

In other developments, Reid responded to a letter written by a group of British Muslim leaders expressing the view that the country's foreign policy was linked with the terror threat.  He said that such a position was a ""dreadful misjudgement that foreign policy of this country should be shaped in part, or in whole, under the threat of terrorism activity.""  Shadow Home Secretary  David Davis reflected a similar sentiment saying, ""There are plenty of people with legitimate arguments with the government's foreign policy on Iraq, in Afghanistan, in Lebanon and the Middle East but none of them take the stance of attempting to murder many thousands of their fellow citizens.""

Meanwhile, United Kingdom Prime Minister Tony Blair expressed his gratitude to security personnel for their efforts in foiling the terrorist attack. United States President George W. Bush reminded people that the United States was still at war with ""Islamic fascists."" Bush also thanked Blair for ""busting this plot.""British Policy on IraqOn February 21, 2007, British Prime Minister Blair announced the withdrawal of some troops from Iraq over the course of the following months.  He said that the 7,100 British troops serving in southern Iraq would be reduced to 5,500 and he hoped that another 500 troops could leave by late summer.  He expected the remaining troops to stay in Iraq until 2008.  Prime Minister Blair defined a new objective for British troops in Iraq, saying that they would be expected to provide requisite support for Iraqi forces and securing the borders.  He also made clear that Iraqis would write the next chapter"" in their country's history.

The announcement by the British prime minister was soon followed with news that the few Danish troops operating in Iraq would also be withdrawn.  As well, Lithuania said that they were considering the removal of their troops from Iraq. 

Even as the news from these three countries was being made public, the United States was moving to increase its troop presence in Iraq under President George W. Bush's controversial plan for escalation.  For its part, the United States characterized Blair's announcement as a positive sign of success in Iraq.  Still, the fact of the matter was that the period had seen an exodus of coalition troops from Iraq, as the war in that country became ever more unpopular across the globe.  Indeed, troops remaining in Iraq from countries belonging to the coalition numbered few in comparison with their United States counterpart.  United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice responded to criticism of the dwindling presence of foreign forces in Iraq by saying that  that the coalition ""remains intact.""Imbroglio with IranThe British presence in Iraq was a key issue in March 2007 when 15 members of the British Navy were captured by members.  The incident occurred on March 23, 2007  when the British Navy personnel boarded a vessel just off the coast of Iraq on the basis of suspected smuggling activities.  The servicemen from the HMS Cornwall were apparently seized by gunpoint by Iran's Revolutionary Guard.  British Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett demanded both the immediate and safe return of the servicemen, as well as a ""full explanation"" from Iran about its actions.

On March 26, 2007, the Iranian government in Tehran said that the British Navy personnel had illegally entered Iranian waters.The Iranian government also noted that the 15 Navy servicemen were undergoing questioning, and offered assurances to the British ambassador about the good health of those captured. In addition, Iran dismissed the notion that they had been taken in exchange for five Iranian diplomats who had earlier detained in Iraq by the United States military. 

The British government countered the claim made by Iran saying that its Navy personnel were conducting routine patrols in Iraqi waters.  To this end, British Prime Minister Tony Blair said, ""It simply is not true that they went into Iranian territorial waters and I hope the Iranian government understands how fundamental an issue this is for us.""  Blair characterized the detention of the 15 members of the Royal Navy as ""unjustified and wrong.""To underline the gravity of the situation, the British government also suspended bilateral contacts with Iran.

It was yet to be seen how Iran would react, given the fact that the diplomatic climate abroad, as well as the political climate at home, were not particularly favorable in March 2007.  First, new sanctions were being imposed by the United Nations (U.N.) Security Council on Iran in regard to its nuclear program.  As well, students at home were reacting to the government's claims about the Royal Navy personnel entry into Iranian waters by calling for them to face trial. 

Days later, Iranian authorities published excerpts of letters by Leading Seaman Faye Turney -- one of the Royal Navy personnel captured.  In the letters, Turney allegedly wrote that she was sorry that she and her fellow Royal Navy servicemen entered Iranian waters.  On March 28, 2007, Iranian state television showed an interview with Turney in which she said, ""Obviously we trespassed"" into Iranian waters.  Nevertheless, Iran said that Turney would be released within days.

British officials responded saying that they expected that Turney had been forced to express such a position, and they did not believe the letters or interview statements were willingly offered.  As well, Prime Minister Blair told the House of Commons that the time had come to ""ratchet up"" pressure on Iran.  Earlier, Blair warned of a ""different phase"" in diplomatic efforts if current initiatives to free the 15 crew members failed.  Meanwhile, the Royal Navy offered Global Positioning Systems (GPS) evidence making clear that the 15 crew members, who were functioning under a United Nations mandate, were 1.7 nautical miles inside Iraqi waters when they were seized.

On March 29, 2007, following a request by the United Kingdom (U.K.), the United Nations Security Council issued a statement conveying  ""grave concern"" for the capture of the British Navy personnel by Iran, and calling on Iran to ensure that the U.K. received consular access. 

For its part, Iran released video footage depicting the 15 British crew members being seized in what it has claimed to be Iranian waters.  Iran also announced that it was freezing the scheduled release of Leading Seaman Turney on the basis of the U.K.'s supposed ""incorrect attitude.""

A day later, Iranian state television aired an interview with a second British Royal Navy serviceman, Nathan Summers.  In that footage, Summer apologized for ""trespassing"" in Iranian waters.  Prime Minister Blair disparaged the footage, saying that the exploitation of the British crew would serve only to ""enhance people's sense of disgust with Iran.""

On the diplomatic front, Iran sent a formal note to the U.K. in which it condemned the Royal Navy's ""illegal act"" and called for guarantees that such trespassing would not be repeated.  Meanwhile, the European Union expressed ""unconditional support"" for the position of the U.K. and urged the ""immediate and unconditional release"" of the 15 Royal Navy personnel.

On April 1, 2007, two other Royal Navy servicemen were shown on Iranian state television.  Captain Chris Ayre and Lieutenant Felix Carman were respectively shown in front of an Iranian map of the Gulf.  Ayre noted that the Iranian maps depicted the area in which he and his associates were captured as Iranian territorial waters.  He said, ""Approximately about ten o'clock in the morning we were seized - apparently at this point here from their maps on the GPS they've shown us - which is inside Iranian territorial waters.""  Carman expressed understanding for the Iranian perspective about the ""intrusion."" 

On the ground in Iran, hard-line students hurled rockets and firecrackers into the compound housing the British embassy, presumably to protest the brewing dissention between the two countries.  As well, about 200 students took to the streets to demonstrate against the alleged trespassing by the British Navy personnel into Iranian waters. 

On the other side of the equation, the British Foreign Office decried the televised footage and characterized it as both ""a charade"" and ""unacceptable.""  The statement by the British Foreign Office included the following assertion: ""It is completely unacceptable for these pictures to be shown on television, given the potential to cause distress to their families."" A day later, the climate appeared to have calmed somewhat, despite the airing of new footage of the 15 who had been detained.Iran noted that a shift from the U.K. could help to resolve the crisis, and in so doing refined its hard-line tone.  Meanwhile, the U.K. Defense Secretary Des Browne said that diplomatic efforts to end the crisis were ongoing, and that London and Tehran were engaging in ""direct bilateral communication."" On  April 4, 2007, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmandinejad held a media conference in Tehran.  At that media event, which was held to present medals of honor to the Republican Guard who had detained the British crew members, he also announced that the British Navy servicemen would be given amnesty and released.  He intimated that the decision was gesture of goodwill to the British,  and that it was being offered in honor of two upcoming events -- the  birthday of the Islamic Prophet Mohammed and  the Christian celebration of Easter.  Iranian state television showed Ahmadinejad greeting the 15 servicemen in what appeared to be a climate of amity.Some analysts characterized the display as being ""a piece of theater.""Regardless, British Prime Minister Tony Blair reacted to the news saying that the release of the 15 Britons would be ""a profound relief"" to the crew and their families. On the diplomatic front, the Iranian leader said that no concessions or deals had been made with the British government to secure the release of the 15 servicemen, although the U.K. made it clear that such an incident would not be repeated.  Meanwhile, the British prime minister did not offer either an apology to Iran for the alleged intrusion into Iranian waters, or thanks for the release of the British Navy personnel.  However, Blair addressed the Iranian people saying,  ""We bear you no ill will. On the contrary, we respect Iran as an ancient civilisation, as a nation with a proud and dignified history. The disagreements we have with your government we wish to resolve peacefully through dialogue. I hope - as I've always hoped - that in the future we are able to do so."" Note: The 15 released servicemen later noted that their statements to Iranian state media had been coerced. Northern Ireland Developments in 2007 At the start of 2007, the issue of policing (discussed above) returned to the political purview when Sinn Fein accused DUP leader Ian Paisley of not providing a ""positive enough"" response to the special meeting its was convening to deal with the crucial issue of policing. The situation took another turn when  Paisley denied ever agreeing to the transfer of policing and justice powers to the Northern Ireland Assembly by 2008.  Paisley also noted that there was no provision for such a move in the St. Andrews Agreement. Regardless, on January 28, 2007, at a special party conference in Dublin, Sinn Fein voted to support policing in Northern Ireland.  The vote was carried overwhelmingly with 90 percent support. It was the first such move in the party's history and was considered a key component in the progress toward devolution in Northern Ireland. Another key aspects on the path toward restoring devolution has been the question of the DUP's  commitment to power-sharing with Sinn Fein in a devolved government by the target date of March 26, 2007.  In March 2007, the election for the new Legislative Assembly of Northern Ireland took place.  Results showed the two hard-line Protestant/Unionist and Catholic/Nationalists parties winning most of the seats at stake.

The election was intended to facilitate the creation of a new power-sharing government, which would represent diverse sectarian interests.  That power-sharing executive entity had to be formed by a deadline of March 26, 2007, in order to move away from direct rule.  However, a failure to do so would leave little chance of restoring the devolved government, and ultimately, it would result in the abandonment of the Northern Ireland's Legislative Assembly at Stormount.  At issue was the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.

Now, with the elections completed, and with the March 26, 2007 deadline looming ahead, Secretary of State Peter Hain said that he would require a status report from the parties within two weeks, in order to meet the deadline for devolution. He warned that the assembly would be abandoned if the parties were not signatories to a power-sharing executive.  That power-sharing executive, if formed, would be made up of four DUP ministers, three Sinn Fein ministers, two UUP ministers and one SDLP minister.  Absent from the executive would be the Alliance Party, the Green Party and the PUPAs midnight struck heralding March 26, 2007, Peter Hain signed an order restarting devolution and effectively restoring power to the Northern Ireland Assembly.  But its revived existence could have had a short life if the deadline for the formation of the power-sharing executive was  not met. 

The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland warned that the assembly at Stormount would be dissolved if agreement on the power-sharing executive was not forged by the deadline.That said, Hain also suggested that he was willing to consider alternative arrangement if the parties could come to some consensus on the issues at stake. For its part, the DUP said that it would enter into a power-sharing government with Sinn Fein, however, it also issued a caveat of sorts by stating that it would not enter into such an arrangement until May.  In response, Sinn Fein charged the DUP with attempting to ""frustrate the will of the electorate."" DUP parliamentarian Jeffrey Donaldson defended his party's decision by noting that the decision to agree to govern jointly with Sinn Fein was one of historic proportions, but that more time was needed to resolve outstanding issues, including departmental pre-briefings, the finalization of a government program, as well as raising confidence levels within the community regarding devolution.

Nevertheless, before the passage of the deadline, the DUP and Sinn Fein announced an historic agreement to form a power-sharing executive on May 8, 2007.  Two main rivals -- the DUP's Ian Paisley and Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams  -- met for direct talks to discuss the deal.  It was agreed that Paisley would be the first minister in the new administration and Sinn Fein's  Martin McGuinness would be deputy first minister. 

Following the unprecedented meeting between Paisley and Adams, the DUP leader  expressed full commitement saying, ""The DUP executive overwhelmingly endorsed a motion committing our party to support and participate fully in government in May of this year - this is a binding resolution.""  Paisley's  nationalist counterpart, Adams, responded to the DUP's endorsement and commitment to joint governance saying,  ""I believe the agreement reached between Sinn Fein and the DUP - including the unequivocal commitment made by their party executive and reiterated today - to the restoration of political institutions on 8 May marks the beginning of a new era of politics on this island."" British Prime Minister Blair  said that the agreement between the DUP and Sinn  Fein was an important one for the people and the history of Northern Ireland.  Irish Taoiseach Bertie Ahern  reacted to the developments by characterizing the agreement was both unprecedented and very positive.  Then, May 8, 2007 saw the establishment of the historic power-sharing at Stormount in Northern Ireland.  Direct rule ended as DUP leader, Ian Paisley, and Martin McGuinness of Sinn Fein, took office as the first and deputy ministers of the new executive respectively.  Paisley marked the occasion saying, ""Today we are starting upon the road which I believe will take us to lasting peace in our province.""  McGuinness expressed confidence that he would be able to work with Paisley  despite the challenges of the past, saying, ""We must overcome the difficulties which we face in order to achieve our goals and seize the opportunities that now exist.""  Witnessing the occasion, British Prime Minister Tony Blair noted that Northern Ireland now had the opportunity to be freed from ""the heavy chains of history"" while charting a new course.  His Irish counterpart, Taoiseach Bertie Ahern expressed his gratitude to politicians who had worked hard to achieve peace.Note: The creation of a new power-sharing government at Stormount was intended to both restore the devolved government and to represent diverse sectarian interests.  The historic occasion marked the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. Developments on Domestic Agenda May 2007 saw Tony Blair's Labour Party suffer some defeats in local elections.  These defeats were largely blamed on the unpopular war in Iraq as well as a domestic scandal involving payments for honor.  Nevertheless, Blair characterized his party's performance as being unexpectedly good noting, ""You always take a hit in the midterm, but these results provide a perfectly good springboard to go on and win the next national election.""  Indeed, the Labour Party's performance was slightly better than in local elections of 2006.

These elections were held for local councils across England.  As well, elections were held in Scotland for local representatives, as well as representatives to the Scottish Parliament, seated in Edinburgh.In Wales, voters chose representatives to the National Assembly, seated in Cardiff.

While the Labour Party's overall loss was smaller than had originally been anticipated, the most significant shift was seen in the closeness of the election in Scotland, typically viewed as a Labour Party stronghold.  There, the Labour Party lost its advantage over the Scottish nationalists. In fact, the strong showing of the Scottish National Party, which promised to hold a referendum on independence by 2010 if it won power, evoked questions about the political terrain there.In Wales, the Labour Party lost some seats but still tallied twice as many in the end, as compared with the nationalist party, Plaid Cymru.

The election came ahead of Blair's anticipated announcement that he would resign as prime minister.  There was some speculation that his likely successor, Gordon Brown, would benefit from the fact that despite the losses just suffered by the Labour Party, the Conservatives in opposition were hardly enjoying a notable ascendant trend. On May 10, 2007, Prime Minister Tony Blair of the United Kingdom issued his long-awaited announcement that he was stepping down from the Labour Party's leadership position and head of government. Blair's announcement made in his Sedgefield constituency and was of an emotional nature.

The prime minister made clear the triumphs achieved by the Labour Party under his leadership, saying, ""There is only one government since 1945 that can say all of the following: more jobs, fewer unemployed, better health and education results, lower crime and economic growth in every quarter.""  At the same time, he also appeared to acknowledge with regret some of the failings of his administration saying,  ""I give my thanks to you, the British people for the times that I have succeeded and my apologies for the times I have fallen short."" In what some interpreted as a nuanced reference to British involvement in the Iraq war, Blair also said, ""I may have been wrong, but I did what I thought was right for our country."" 

Now with Blair's departure imminent, attention turned to his likely successor. The head of the Treasury, Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, has been viewed as Blair's ""heir apparent"" for some time.  With several leading members of the Labour Party bowing out, Brown was expected to win the party's internal contest for the leadership position.

In the third week of June 2007, Chancellor Gordon Brown officially became the new leader of the United Kingdom's Labour Party.  The move came days before outgoing Prime Minister Tony Blair prepared to step down as the British head of government on June 27, 2007.  On that day, Brown would become the new prime minister and head of government in the United Kingdom.

In his acceptance speech, Brown praised Blair for his service to the Labour Party and to the country, and promised to forge not merely political policies, but also a ""soul"" for the country's leading political party, as it responded to the changing needs of the British people.  To this end, he began his speech stating, ""It is with humility, pride and a great sense of duty that I accept the privilege and the great responsibility of leading our party and changing our country.""  On policy, he identified priority areas as being education, affordable housing, childhood poverty, constitutional reform, and modernizing the National Health Service (NHS).  In the area of foreign affairs, Brown said that lessons had to be learned, and he acknowledged the divisive nature of the war in Iraq.

In other developments in the Labour Party, Harriet Harman won a slim victory over five rivals to take the position as deputy party leader, thus succeeding John Prescott.  Brown announced that Deputy Leader Harman would also act as party chairman, and he noted that all party members would have a say in the development of policy initiatives.  No deputy prime minister was announced. 

Meanwhile, the change in leadership at the helm of the Labour Party appeared to be yielding positive results for a party that had suffered waning public support in recent times.  Now, an Ipsos/Mori opinion poll showed that support for the Labour Party had risen to 39 percent in June 2007, while both the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats had lost support, with the two parties slipping to 36 percent and 15 percent respectively.On June 27, 2007, Tony Blair issued his resignation from office to the British monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, following a short private meeting.  As he left parliament for the final time, Blair received a rousing standing ovation. He also traveled to his constituency of Sedgefield where he bid farewell to local party members following his tenure as their parliamentarian for 24 years.  Blair was set to move on to work as the new Middle East peace envoy for the Middle East quartet, composed of the European Union, the United Nations, United States and Russia.

Blair's exit was followed by the Queen appointing Gordon Brown, as the head of the Labour Party, to be the United Kingdom's new prime minister.  Queen Elizabeth II also spent almost an hour in a private audience with Brown.  In his first address as head of government, Prime Minister Brown said, ""Let the work of change begin."" He  pledged to meet his expressed policy goals ""try my utmost"" – a reference to his student motto.  Just before entering 10 Downing Street, Prime Minister Brown said, ""I will be strong in purpose, steadfast in will, resolute in action in the service of what matters to the British people, meeting the concerns and aspirations of our whole country.""A new cabinet was announced a day later on June 28, 2007, with significant changes at stake. Every portfolio in cabinet, with the exception of Defense Minister Des Brown, was changed.  Certain key Blairites were leaving the political scene.  John Reid was retiring as Home Secretary and Patricia Hewitt was resigning both as Health Secretary and from government.  Margaret Beckett was leaving the role of Foreign Secretary. Of note was the fact that the country would have its first female Home Secretary Jacqui Smith.  A stalwart of the Brown camp, Alistair Darling, was set to become the new Chancellor of the Exchequer, while David Miliband was the new Foreign Secretary.  Jack Straw was to become the new Justice Secretary.The new cabinet convened on June 28, 2007 for the first time.New Prime Minister Confronts Renewed Threat of TerrorismOn June 29, 2007, two cars loaded with explosives, nails and gas cylinders, were found in London.  Neither car detonated, thus sparing people from the potential violence and loss of life that might have been caused by the car bombs exploding.  A day later, a burning vehicle, also loaded with gas cylinders, rammed into the main terminal of Glasgow Airport in Scotland.  Again, that incident yielded no loss of life.The attempted attack in Glasgow was deemed to be related to the two earlier attempted attacks in London.

British authorities later said that all three incidences were clearly attempted acts of terrorism attributable to associates of al-Qaida.  Several people were soon arrested in connection with the apparent terror plot, including the two individuals responsible for driving the burning Jeep into the airport at Glasgow.  Also included in those detained were a handful of doctors studying or practicing medicine in the United Kingdom.  Searches were being carried out across the country for others who might have been involved in these attempted acts of terrorism.  At least one suspect was said to be ""on the run.""  None of the suspects were said to be of British origin, with certain suspects being identified as being of  Iraqi and Jordanian background.

The timing of the incidences -- about two years after the July 2005 terror attacks on London's transit system, along with the fact that Gordon Brown had only assumed governing power days before -- appeared to be significant.  Nevertheless, Prime Minister Brown signaled his intent to take the threat of terrorism in the United Kingdom seriously,  raising the terror alert in the country to ""critical,"" and urging the British people to stay ""constantly vigilant"" against what he warned would be a ""long-term and sustained threat.""  In an interview with the BBC, Prime Minister Brown said, ""It's obvious that we have a group of people - not just in this country, but round the world - who're prepared at any time to inflict what they want to be maximum damage on civilians, irrespective of the religion of these people who are killed or maimed."" He also noted that his country would not yield, despite the violent intent of al-Qaida.

Home Secretary Jacqui Smith was granted no grace period in her new position.  She convened meetings at the government's emergency response unit, known by the name Cobra.  Following the fourth Cobra meeting within the space of days, Smith noted that the British people would not be intimidated and that life would go on as ever.  She also announced that a formal statement would be offered before the House of Commons on July 2, 2007.

Meanwhile, attention was turning toward the authorization to hold terror suspects for up to 90 days without charges being levied.  This measure had been defeated a few years prior in parliament by a coalition of Conservative, Liberal Democratic and Labour backbenchers, however, in light of the current landscape, it was expected to be revived.Other DevelopmentsThe close of July 2007 saw new British Prime Minister Gordon Brown hold official talks with his American counterpart, United States President George W. Bush, for the first time since succeeding Tony Blair.  The two heads of government  met at Camp David in the United States. At issue was the state of the trans-Atlantic relationship, given Tony Blair's exit from the office of the prime minister, and Brown's entry into that role.  Brown signaled goodwill by noting that the world owed the United States a debt of gratitude for its leadership in the global war on terror.  Yet unknown was the matter of whether or not there would be a change in the United Kingdom's role in Iraq.Then, on October 8, 2007, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said that his country's troops in Iraq would be reduced to 2,500 by the spring of 2008.  Speaking to parliamentarians, Brown said that the reduction was possible because Iraqis were now better positioned to take responsibility for their own security.  He also noted that the handover of Basra would ensue on a phased basis.Two days before British Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced the reduction of troops in Iraq, he said that he would not be calling an election anytime soon, since he needed time to put forth his ""vision"" for the United Kingdom.  The political opposition blasted the move, saying that Brown was opting out of an immediate election contest because of his party's poor polling numbers.Special Entry: 

Global credit crisis; effects felt in Europe

Summary:

A financial farrago,  rooted in the credit crisis, became a global phenomenon by the start of October 2008. In the United States, after failure of the passage of a controversial bailout plan in the lower chamber of Congress, an amended piece of legislation finally passed through both houses of Congress.  There were hopes that its passage would calm jitters on Wall Street and restore confidence in the country's financial regime.However, a volatile week on Wall Street followed, most sharply characterized by a precipitous 18 percent drop of the Dow Jones.  With the situation requiring rapid and radical action, a new proposal for the government to bank stakes was gaining steam. Meanwhile, across the Atlantic in Europe, with banks also in jeopardy of failing, and with no coordinated efforts to stem the tide by varying countries of the European Union, there were rising anxieties not only about the resolving the financial crisis, but also about the viability of the European bloc.Nevertheless, European leaders were able to forge an agreement aimed at easing the credit crunch in that region of the world.  Following is an exploration, first, of the situation in the United States, and, second, of the situation unfolding in Europe.Report:On Sept. 28, 2008, as the United States was reeling from the unfolding credit crisis, Europe's banking sector was also hit by its own woes  when the Dutch operations of the European banking and insurance entity, Fortis, was partly nationalized in an effort to prevent its ultimate demise.  Radical action was spurred by anxieties that Fortis was too much of a banking and financial giant to be allowed to fail.  The Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg forged an agreement to contribute more than 11 billion euros (approximately US$16 billion) to shore up  Fortis, whose  share price fell precipitously due to worries about its bad debts.

A day later, the  mortgage lender -- Bradford and Bingley -- in the United Kingdom was  nationalized when the British government took control of the bank's  mortgages and loans.  Left out of the nationalization scheme were the savings and branch operations, which were  sold off to Santander of Spain. Earlier, the struggling mortgage lender, Northern Rock, had itself been nationalized.  The head of the British Treasury,  Alistair Darling, indicated that  ""big steps"" that would not normally be taken were in the offing, given the unprecedented nature of the credit crisis.

On the same day, financial  woes came to a head in Iceland when the government was compelled to seize control of the country's third-largest bank , Glitnir, due to financial problems and fears that it would go insolvent.Iceland was said to be in serious financial trouble, given the fact that its liabilities were in gross excess of the country's GDP.  Further action was anticipated in Iceland, as a result.

On Sept 30, 2008, another European bank -- Dexia -- was the victim of the intensifying global banking and financial crisis.  In order to keep Dexia afloat, the governments of France, Belgium,  and Luxembourg convened talks and agreed to contribute close to 6.5 billion euros (approximately US$9 billion) to keep Dexia from suffering a demise.

Only days later, the aforementioned Fortis bank returned to the forefront of the discussion in Europe.  Belgian Prime Minister Yves Leterme said he was hoping to locate a new owner with the aim of restoring  confidence in Fortis, and thusly,  preventing a further downturn in the markets.  Leterme said that the authorities were considering takeover bids for the Belgian operations of the company (the Dutch operations were nationalized as noted above.)

By Sept. 5, 2008, one of Germany's biggest banks, Hypo Real Estate, was at risk of failing.  In response, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she would exhaust all efforts to save the bank.  A rescue plan by the government and banking institutions was eventually agreed upon at a cost of 50 billion euros (approximately US$70 billion).  This agreement involved a higher cost than was previously discussed.

Meanwhile, as intimated above, Iceland was enduring further financial shocks to its entire banking system.  As such, the government of Iceland was involved in intense discussions aimed at saving the country's financial regime, which were now at severe risk of collapse due to insolvency of the country's commercial banks.

Meanwhile, on Sept. 4, 2008, the leaders of key European states -- United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Italy -- met in the French capital city of Paris to discuss the financial farrago and to consider possible action.  The  talks, which were hosted by French President Nicolas Sarkozy, ended without consensus on what should be done to deal with the credit crisis, which was rapidly becoming a global phenomenon.  The only thing that the four European countries agreed upon was that  there would not be a grand rescue plan, akin to the type that was initiated in the United States.  As well, they  jointly called for more greater regulation and a coordinated response.  To that latter end, President Nicolas Sarkozy said, ""Each government will operate with its own methods and means, but in a coordinated manner.""

This call came after Ireland took independent action to deal with the burgeoning financial crisis.Notably, the Irish government decided days earlier  to fully guarantee all deposits in the country's major banks for a period of two years.  The Greek government soon followed suit with a similar action.  These  actions by Ireland and Greece raised the ire of other European countries, and evoked questions of whether Ireland and Greece had violated any European Union charters.  An investigation by the European Union was pending into whether or not Ireland's guarantee of all savings deposits was anti-competitive in nature.

Nevertheless, as anxieties about the safety of bank deposits rose across Europe, Ireland and Greece saw an influx of new banking customers from across the continent, presumably seeking the security of knowing their money would be safe amidst a financial meltdown.And even with questions rising about the decisions of the Irish and Greek government, the government of Germany decided to go down a similar path by guaranteeing all private bank accounts. For his part, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said that his government would increase  the limit on guaranteed bank deposits from £35,000 to £50,000.

In these various ways, it was clear that there was no concurrence among some of Europe's most important economies. In fact, despite the meeting in France, which called for coordination among the countries of the European bloc, there was no unified response to the global financial crisis.  Instead, that  meeting laid bare the divisions within the countries of the European Union, and called  into question the very viability of the European bloc.Perhaps that question of viability would be answered at a forthcoming G8 summit, as recommended by those participating in the Paris talks.

A week later, another meeting of European leaders  in Paris ended with concurrence that no large institution would be allowed to fail.  The meeting, which was attended by leaders of euro zone countries,resulted in an agreement to guarantee loans between banks until the end of 2009, with an eye on easing the credit crunch.  The proposal, which would apply in 15 countries, also included a plan for capital infusions by means of purchasing preference shares from banks.The United Kingdom, which is outside the euro zone,  had already announced a similar strategy.  Indeed,  British Prime Minister Gordon Brown gained cachet for his steady handling of the financial crisis.  Brown said that his government had to be the ""rock of stability"" during the crisis and explained that injections of capital by the British Treasury and the government takeover of banks was ""unprecedented but necessary.""French President Nicolas Sarkozy  argued that these unprecedented measures  were of vital importance.  The French leader said, ""The crisis has over the past few days entered into a phase that makes it intolerable to opt for procrastination and a go-it-alone approach.""He also tried to ease growing frustration that such measures would benefit the wealthy by explaining that the strategy would not constitute  ""a gift to banks.""

While these developments were aimed at restoring confidence in the financial regime in Europe, Iceland continued to struggle.  Indeed, the country's economy stood precipitously close to collapse.  Three banks, including the country's largest one -- Kaupthing  -- had to be rescued by the government.  Landsbanki and Glitnir had been nationalized.  A spokesperson for Iceland's Financial Supervisory Authority  said, ""The action taken... was a necessary first step in achieving the objectives of the Icelandic government and parliament to ensure the continued orderly operation of domestic banking and the safety of domestic deposits.""

With the country in a state of economic panic, trading on the OMX Nordic Exchange  was suspended temporarily, although it was expected to reopen on October 13, 2008.  Once re-opened, the OMX Nordic Exchange experienced a high degree of volatility -- initially plunging before recouping some losses.  Iceland's Prime Minister Geir Haarde said that his country was considering whether to seek assistance from  the International Monetary Fund to weather the crisis.  As well, Iceland's Central Bank drew upon more than half-billion dollars from Scandinavian  swap facility, thus enabling access to euros as the stock exchange reopened after a temporary suspension, as discussed above.Iceland was also courting financial assistance from Russia; to that end, Icelandic authorities were seeking a loan from Moscow of about four billion euros or $5.5 billion USD.  Iceland was also ensconced in a mini-imbroglio with the United Kingdom over that country's decision to freeze Icelandic bank assets.  At issue was the United Kingdon's reaction to the unfolding crisis in Iceland, which the British authorities said left deposits by its own citizens at risk.  British Prime Minister Gordon Brown particularly condemned the government of Iceland for its poor stewardship of the situation and also its failure to  guarantee British savers' deposits (Icelandic domestic deposits, by contrast, had been guaranteed by the country's Financial Supervisory Authority).That said, the United Kingdom Treasury was eventually able to arrange for some British deposits to Kaupthing to be moved under the control of ING Direct.  There were also arrangements being made for a payout to Landsbanki's depositors.Europe facing financial crisis as banking bail-out looms large in early 2009:

According to the European Commission, European banks may be in need of as much as several trillion in bailout funding. Impaired or toxic assets factor highly on the European Union bank balance sheets, with credit default swaps on Irish debt running at 355 basis points higher at the time of writing -- the highest rate in Europe and well on its way down the path of Iceland. Anxieties were so high in Dublin that tens of thousands of people took to the streets to protest the growing financial crisis.

Meanwhile, the fallout from the housing bubble was deleteriously affecting the United Kingdom, with anxieties being stoked about whether British banks could at all be saved.

In Spain, unemployment was in double digit territory and industrial production plunged 20 percent from where it was a year earlier. It was anticipated that credit default swaps for Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece would double over the course of the next year. In other parts of Europe, according to economist Nouriel Roubini, the economies of Ukraine, Belarus, Hungary, Latvia and Lithuania appeared to be on the brink of disaster.

Regarding Ukraine, there were fears that it would might not abide with terms of a loan from the International Monetary Fund and thusly default on its debt. Meanwhile in Poland, the currency was falling and in Russia, even as the rouble fell, the Kremli warned of economic contraction.

Overall, Eastern European countries borrowed heavily from Western European banks. Thus, even if the currencies on the eastern part of the continent collapse, effects will be felt in the western part of Europe as well. For example, Swiss banks that gave billions of credit to Eastern Europe cannot look forward to repayment anytime soon. As well, Austrian banks have had extensive exposure to Eastern Europe, and can anticipate a highly increased cost of insuring its debt.

German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck has warned that as many as 16 European Union countries will require assistance. Indeed, his statements suggest the need for a regional rescue effort. Of consideration is the fact that, according to the Maastricht Treaty, state-funded bailouts are prohibited.

By the close of February 2009, it was announced that the banking sectors in Central and Eastern Europe would receive a rescue package of $31 billion, via the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the World Bank. The rescue package was aimed at assisting the survival of small financial institutions and included equity and debt financing, as well as access to credit and risk insurance aimed at encouraging lending.European Union backs financial regulation overhaul:

With the global financial crisis intensifying, leaders of European Union countries backed sweeping financial regulations. Included in the package of market reforms were sanctions on tax havens, caps on bonus payments to management, greater hedge fund regulation, and increased influence by the International Monetary Fund. European leaders also backed a charter of sustainable economic activity, that would subject all global financial activities to both regulation and accountability by credit rating agencies.

These moves were made ahead of the Group of 20 summit scheduled for April 2, 2009, in London. It was not known whether other countries outside Europe, such as the United States, Japan, India and China, would support the new and aggressive regime of market regulation. That said, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said in Berlin that Europe had a responsibility to chart this track. She said, ""Europe will own up to its responsibility in the world.""

For its part, the Obama administration in Washington did not provide particularized feedback on the measures being pushed forward in Europe. However, the Obama administration indicated that it wanted to work with the international community to advance improvements, including regulation, to the financial regime.Leaders forge $1 trillion deal at G-20 summit in London

Leaders of the world's largest economies, known as the ""G-20,"" met in London to explore possible responses to the global financial crisis. To that end, they forged a deal valued at more than one trillion dollars (USD).

Central to the agreement was an infusion of $750 billion to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which was aimed at helping troubled economies. Up to $100 billion of that amount was earmarked to assist the world's very poorest countries -- an amount far greater than had been expected. In many senses, the infusion of funding to the IMF marked a strengthening of that body unseen since the 1980s.

In addition, the G-20 leaders settled on a $250 billion increase in global trade. The world's poorest countries would also benefit from the availability of $250 billion of trade credit.

After some debate, the G-20 leaders decided to levy sanctions against clandestine tax havens and to institute strict financial regulations. Such regulations included tougher controls on banking professionals' salaries and bonuses, and increased oversight of hedge funds and credit rating agencies. A Financial Stability Board was to be established that would work in concert with the IMF to facilitate cross-border cooperation, and also to provide early warnings regarding the financial system.

Aside from these measures, the G-20 countries were already implementing their own economic stimulus measures at home, aimed at reversing the global recession. Together, these economic stimulus packages would inject approximately $5 trillion by the end of 2010.

United Kingdom Prime Minister Gordon Brown played host at the meeting, which most concurred went off successfully, despite the presence of anti-globalization and anarchist protestors. Prime Minister Brown warned that there was ""no quick fix"" for the economic woes facing the international community, but he drew attention to the consensus that had been forged in the interest of the common good. He said, ""This is the day that the world came together to fight back against the global recession, not with words, but with a plan for global recovery and for reform and with a clear timetable for its delivery.""

All eyes were on United States President Barack Obama, who characterized the G-20 summit as ""a turning point"" in the effort towards global economic recovery. He also hailed the advances agreed upon to reform the failed regulatory regime that contributed to the financial crisis that has gripped many of the economies across the globe. Thusly, President Obama declared the London summit to be historic saying, ""It was historic because of the size and the scope of the challenges that we face and because of the timeliness and the magnitude of our response.""

Ahead of the summit, there were reports of a growing rift between the respective duos of France and Germany -- and -- the United States and the United Kingdom. While France and Germany were emphasizing stricter financial regulations, the United States and the United Kingdom were advocating public spending to deal with the economic crisis. Indeed, French President Nicolas Sarkozy had threatened to bolt the meeting if his priority issues were not addressed. But such an end did not occur, although tensions were existent.

To that end, President Obama was hailed for his diplomatic skills after he brokered an agreement between France and China on tax havens. The American president played the role of peacemaker between French President Sarkozy and Chinese Premier Hu Jintao, paving the way for a meeting of the minds on the matter of tax havens.

French President Nicolas Sarkozy said that the concurrence reached at the G-20 summit were ""more than we could have hoped for."" President Sarkozy also credited President Obama for the American president's leadership at the summit, effusively stating: ""President Obama really found the consensus. He didn't focus exclusively on stimulus ... In fact it was he who managed to help me persuade [Chinese] President Hu Jintao to agree to the reference to the ... publication of a list of tax havens, and I wish to thank him for that.""

Meanwhile, German Chancellor Angela Merkel also expressed positive feedback about the success of the summit noting that the new measures would give the international arena a ""clearer financial market architecture."" She noted that the agreement reached was ""a very, very good, almost historic compromise."" Finally, Chancellor Merkel had warm words of praise for President Obama. ""The American president also put his hand into this,"" said Merkel.

Note: The G-20 leaders agreed to meet again in September 2009 in New York to assess the progress of their agenda.Special Entry: ""Real IRA"" claims responsibility for attack on British army baseMarch 2009 was marked by an attack by two gunmen at an army base, which left two soldiers dead. Both soldiers were due to be deployed to Afghanistan.  At the Antrim army base, the gunmen also injured four people, including two pizza delivery men.  The incident marked the first killing of soldiers in Northern Ireland since the assassination of Lance Bombardier Stephen Restorick in 1997.

British Prime Minister Gordon Brown described the attack as ""evil"" and vowed that it would not impeded the peace process. He also promised to bring those responsible to justice saying, ""We will do everything in our power to make sure that Northern Ireland is safe and secure and I assure you we will bring these murderers to justice.""

Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, characterized the attack as and attempt to derail the peace process and noted that it was ""wrong and counter-productive.""

Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister Martin McGuiness, who was a former member of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), decried the attack saying, ""I supported the IRA during the conflict, I myself was a member of the IRA but that war is over. Now the people responsible for that last night's incident are clearly signaling that they want to resume or restart that war.""

Northern Ireland's First Minister Peter Robinson, who was also  Democratic Unionist Party leader, said that cast the attack as a ""terrible reminder of the events of the past.""

In the aftermath of the attack, the ""Real IRA"" claimed responsibility.  The ""Real IRA"" emerged due to a split within the Provisional IRA in 1997 due to Sinn Fein's decision to participate in the peace process.  The ""Real IRA"" was behind the bombing of the County Tyrone town of Omagh that left 29 people dead in 1998.Recent DevelopmentsJune 2009 saw British Prime Minister Gordon Brown try to hold onto power by carrying out a cabinet reshuffle.  At issue was an unfolding scandal involving the expense accounts of parliamentarians. The matter contributed to a wave of resignations from parliamentarians within Prime Minister  Brown's cabinet, including Home Secretary Jacqui Smith and Communities and Local Government Secretary Hazel Blears.

But the decision to keep Chancellor Alistair Darling in his post as the head of the Treasury, despite the allegations that he inappropriately charged services to his parliamentary account, was decried even from within the Labour Party.  Indeed,  Work and Pensions Secretary James Purnell said he was resigning  ""for the good of the Labor Party"" and expressed no confidence in Prime Minister Brown himself.  Defense Secretary John Hutton, however, expressed support for the prime minister, who himself was accountable for the sage.  Prime Minister Brown said, ""I admit mistakes have been made and I accept full responsibility.""  He promised an independent audit of parliamentarians' expense accounts, pledge to stamp out the abuses, and expend his effort on economic recovery and political reform.

In the background of the political chaos for Prime Minister Brown's government were local English elections, as well as elections to the parliament of the European Union.  Observers noted that if Brown's Labour Party fared badly in these two sets of elections, it would intensify the calls for either the prime minister's resignation -- or -- snap elections. Either option would not bode well for the political fate of the Labour Party.

To that end, the Labour Party suffered a trouncing at the local level.  Indeed, the party was no longer in control of any country council in the country. Results showed Conservatives winning 38 percent of the vote, the Liberal Democrats took 28 percent, and the Labour Party slid into decline with a poor 23 percent showing.

In European Union elections, Labour also suffered a weak third place performance. The Conservatives took little solace in the fact that they were unable to significantly increase their share of seats at the European parliament. Perhaps more important was the success of small parties, including the extreme right-wing British Nationalist Party, which gained representation to the dismay of both the Labour Party and the Conservatives.  But that result was expected to hit Brown and Labour most hard, with those from within the party blaming the ongoing  political chaos on the outcome that an extremist political party would have seats in Brussels.

With an increasing chorus for snap elections to be held, broader polling data indicated that the Labour Party (at 22 percent support) was now trailing the Liberal Democratic Party (25 percent) in popular support for the first time in more than two decades. The expense scandal was largely to blame for the loss of support, although the Conservatives, who polled highest (40 percent), were also viewed as having been damaged as a result of the scandal, suggesting that voters were generally disillusioned by the politicians of the two main parties. In this way, the Liberal Democrats were the only major party to see a marked amplification in political fortune.Scotland's jurisprudence came under fire in the aftermath of the decision to free  Abdel Baset al-Megrahi -- the man responsible for the bombing of the Pan American flight that exploded over the town of Lockerbie in 1988.  Scotland's Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill justified the decision on compassionate grounds since al-Magrahi was terminally ill with prostate cancer.  MacAskill said the decision ""was not based on political, economic or diplomatic considerations""  but was one that he made alone and he would have to live with the consequences.  MacAskill conceded that Libya had acted wrongly by giving al-Megrahi a hero's welcome when he arrived back home on Libyan soil. In an address to parliament, he said, ""It is a matter of great regret that Mr. Megrahi was received in such an inappropriate manner. It showed no compassion or sensitivity to the families of the 270 victims of Lockerbie.""  Indeed, the matter has been a source of embarrassment for the Scots at home who were chagrined to see their flag being waved in Libya in support for the return of a convicted terrorist.

On the other side of the Atlantic -- and home to many of the Lockerbie victims -- the United States Department of State made it clear that it ""passionately"" disagreed with the decision.  Still, the United States acknowledged that the matter would not rupture good relations with the United Kingdom.  State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said: ""We made it quite clear that we disagreed passionately with this decision, because we thought it sent the wrong signal to, not only the families, but also to terrorists. But I really discourage you from thinking that we necessarily have to have some kind of tit-for-tat retaliation because of it. I just don't see it - not with Britain.""  That said, there remained grassroots rumblings of a trade boycott of Scotland as a result of the situation.

The case became marred by further controversy after a Times of London news story was published suggesting  an ""oil for freedom"" deal between Libya and the United Kingdom.  But on Aug. 31, 2009, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said that al-Megrahi was not released as part of an oil exploration deal with Libya.  The office of the prime minister insisted there was no deal associated with the release of al-Megrahi,  and denied the Times of London charge that the move was made in order to facilitate oil exploration rights in Libya by the British energy company, British Petroleum. In November 2009, former Prime Minister Tony Blair's role in the rationale for the Iraq war re-emerged.  According to the British newspaper, the Telegraph, secret documents indicated a ""critical failure"" in the  government's case for war in Iraq.  The Telegraph alleged that in 2002,  former Prime Minister Tony Blair misled the public and parliament when he said that the United Kingdom's objective was ""disarmament, not regime change"" and there was no plan for military action. Instead, the documents reportedly showed that there was indeed preparation for the invasion and and overthrow of the regime of  Saddam Hussein in 2002. The documents also reportedly showed that British forces were unprepared and poorly equipped for the 2003 invasion. The Telegraph did not confirm whether or not it would publish the secret documents that formed the basis for the news article. In the first week of 2010, two former British cabinet ministers challenged the authority of British Prime Minister Gordon Brown by calling for a secret ballot on his leadership.  The call, which was issued by Geoff Hoon and Patricia Hewitt of Brown's own ruling Labour Party, came only months ahead of general elections in the United Kingdom.  In a letter to fellow Labour Party parliamentarians, Hoon and Hewitt wrote: ""As we move towards a general election, it remains the case that the Parliamentary Labour Party is deeply divided over the question of the leadership.  Many colleagues have expressed their frustration at the way in which this question is affecting our political performance. We have therefore come to the conclusion that the only way to resolve this issue would be to allow every member to express their view in a secret ballot.""  The office of the prime minister rejected the call for such a vote on Brown's leadership, in fact characterizing the move as ""ludicrous"" and unhelpful to  the Labour Party ahead of the general election.  While the chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party, Tony Lloyd, said there was ""very little support"" for a secret vote on Brown's leadership, there were nonetheless elements within the party who have viewed Brown's performance as a likely death knell to their electoral prospects.  Indeed, polling data ahead of the anticipated elections have shown the opposition Conservatives with a double-digit lead over Labour.  On January 29, 2010, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair defended his decision to draw his country into the United States-led invasion of Iraq and ensuing war, explaining that the September 11, 2001 terror attacks changed the way in which the threat of terrorism could be viewed.  Speaking at a commission charged with inquiring into the events leading to British involvement in the Iraq war, Blair said: ""Here's what changed for me: the whole calculus of risk. The point about this terrorist act was over 3,000 people had been killed, an absolutely horrific event. But if these people -- inspired by this religious fanaticism -- could have killed 30,000, they would have.""  He went on to explain that terrorism with a direct political purpose, such as violence by the Irish Republican Army,  was ""within a framework you could understand.""  He also suggested that before the terror attacks of 2001, the policy of containment against Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq made sense.  However, Blair testified that the terror attacks of 2001 were of such a different variety that it required action against countries such as Iran, Libya, North Korea, and Iraq.  On Feb. 23, 2010, a car bomb exploded close to a court house and popular cafes and bars in the city of Newry in Northern Ireland.  The explosion was blamed on Irish  republican dissidents, according to authorities on the scene.  No one was hurt as a result of the attack.  Anonymous warnings were issued to businesses and a hospital stating that a bomb would explode within 30 minutes.  In actuality, the car bomb was detonated less than 20 minutes after the warnings were issued.  The bombing occurred only weeks after a  compromise deal was struck, aimed at transferring responsibility for the justice system (police and courts) to the government of Northern Ireland. That compromise deal was sanctioned by both the Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn Fein.  Because the bombing occurred close to a courthouse, there was some speculation that it was motivated by republican dissidents' frustration over that agreement. For some time,  the justice system in Northern Ireland has been a source of consternation with Catholics viewing the police and courts as unfairly favoring the majority Protestant population.  See ""Appendix"" for more details related to Northern Ireland.  A spy scandal that implicated Israeli nationals on March 23, 2010 led to the decision by the United Kingdom to expel an Israeli  diplomat.  At issue was the use of forged British passports in the suspected Mossad  assassination of a Hamas commander,  Mahmoud Al Mabhouh, in a Dubai hotel room.  The move came after an investigation into the matter and was made official with an address by British Foreign Secretary David Miliband to parliamentarians in the House of Commons.  To date,  Israel has neither confirmed nor denied involvement in the apparent targeted assassination of al-Mabhouh.  2010 Parliamentary Elections  Summary

With the votes counted, it was clear that the anticipated inconclusive election outcome had come to pass with no party winning a clear majority. The last time a British election produced such a result was in 1974.  While the Conservatives or Tories were set to become the largest party in parliament, they were yet short of a parliamentary majority.  As expected, Labour lost their majority.  But with a ""hung parliament"" looming before the United Kingdom, all eyes were on the Liberal Democrats, whose party was likely to be the most influential player in the election.  To that end, the Liberal Democrats entered negotiations with both potential coalition partners, yielding more positive results with the Conservatives rather than Labour.  As a result, Prime Minister Gordon Brown resigned as head of government, paving the way for David Cameron to become the new prime minister of the United Kingdom.

Background

On April 6, 2010, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced that a general election would be held on May 6, 2010.  He said the anticipated elections would allow the British citizenry to decide whether to give his Labour Party a clear mandate for his main policy initiative: job creation. Prime Minister Brown sought consent from the head of state,  Queen Elizabeth II, to dissolve parliament at a meeting in Buckingham Palace. He then said, ""It will come as no surprise to all of you, and it's probably the least well kept secret of recent years but the queen has kindly agreed to the dissolution of parliament and a general election will take place on May 6.""

The actual dissolution of parliament was scheduled for April 12, 2010, offering less than one month for an election campaign.  To that end, Prime Minister Brown indicated that his roots derived from an ""ordinary middle class family in an ordinary town"" had informed his desire to fight on behalf of families of modest means.  Prime Minister Brown also emphasized his economic credentials by noting that the country was on the road to economic recovery, and that the leader of government should get the ""big decisions right.""

On the other side of the equation, Conservative Party leader and opposition leader David Cameron expressed delight that he would finally be able to commence campaigning.  For his part, Cameron offered up the Conservatives or Tories as the party that would offer the United Kingdom a fresh start. Speaking to this theme, Cameron said, ""If we win this election, there will be real change. You don't have to put up with another five years of Gordon Brown.""

Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg was quick to offer a far more substantive transformation for British citizens, noting that his party offered something completely new, as compared with the dichotomous old politics of the two main parties.

Ahead of election day, British citizens would for the first time be subject to three televised debates between the three main political leaders.  Traditional election themes of economic development, deficits, taxation, and public service were expected to factor highly in those exchanges.

Polling Data and the Debate Effect

At the time the election was called, polling data  showed the Conservatives were leading Labor, albeit by varying margins. An ICM survey showed the Conservatives  (Tories) with 37 percent, Labour with 33 percent and the Liberal Democrats with 21 percent.  A survey by YouGov poll gave the Tories a 10 percent lead over Labour -- a necessary margin if Cameron hoped to secure an outright parliamentary majority  (326 seats) in the United Kingdom's ""first past the post"" system.

By mid-April 2010, following a televised debate among the three main parties' leaders, a shift of fortune had unfolded.  A strong performance by Clegg -- hitherto an unknown commodity on the British political landscape -- appeared to have resulted in increased  public support.  Snap polls conducted after the debate showed that Clegg was the clear winner, according to the newspaper, the Telegraph.  Indeed,  a survey by YouGov for The Sun gave Clegg the most impressive polling result with  51 percent of respondents favoring him, as compared with Cameron, who had 29 percent, and Brown with 19 percent. Similar results were registered by a ComRes poll for ITV News, showing  that 43 percent of respondents thought Clegg was the debate winner, compared to Cameron's 26 percent and Brown's 20 percent.  Sky News' text-message poll showed closer results but, again, with Clegg as the winner with 37 percent; Brown was in second place with 32 percent and Cameron was in third place with 31 percent.

While the public's perceptions of which political leader won the debate was not a clear indicator of voting preferences, it certainly opened the possibility  that the election contest was wider than originally conceived.  To this end, Jeremy John Durham Ashdown, the former Liberal Democrats leader, declared that Clegg's debate performance had ""made this a three-way race."" He continued, ""Nick made it clear that change to the Tories or to Labour is not change.""With an eye on electoral strategy, Ashdown said, ""If the Liberal Democrats can win 25 percent in the polls and Labour gets 27 percent, then you have changed the dynamic of this election.""

Cleggs's success may have rested not only on his strong performance but on another factor.  Specifically, the disaffection by the British electorate for the two major parties, partially fueled by the public's disgust regarding a parliamentarians' expense accounts.  That scandal, which forced several parliamentarians into early retirement ahead of the polls, appeared to be pushing many voters toward a third viable option in the form of the Liberal Democrats.

Indeed, by the third week of April 2010, it was clear that the public's perception of the debate had actually translated into transformations in voters' preferences. A post-debate ComRes poll for the Independent showed the Conservatives with a receding lead of 31 percent, the Liberal Democrats now surging past Labour into second place with 29 percent, and Labour trailing with 27 percent.A YouGive poll actually  showed the Liberal Democrats now carrying a lead with 33 percent, the Tories in second place with 33 percent, and Labour again in third place with 26 percent.  The polling variances notwithstanding, it was apparent that in the United Kingdom's first past the post system, these forthcoming elections could well end in a hung parliament.  With the rising fortune of the Liberal Democrats, there was now no party likely to have enough seats in parliament to form a majority government.

Attention soon refocused on the second televised debate, which was to concentrate on foreign policy.  The two institutionalized parties were banking on Clegg's lack of expertise in this arena to reassert themselves in the electoral race.  Indeed, the second debate was marked by fractious exchanges. Brown accused Cameron of being ""anti-European"" and Clegg of being ""anti-American.""  Burnishing his internationalist credentials, Brown said: ""I am afraid David is anti-European, Nick is anti- American. Both of them are out of touch with reality."" But Cameron countered with a populist  argument, saying that decisions made in Brussels -- the headquarters of the European Union -- should always be questioned in favor of the nationalist interests. Meanwhile, Clegg tried to outline what the Liberal Democrats' foreign policy would look like by saying, ""I want us to lead in the world and I want us to lead in Europe, not complain from the sidelines.""

Despite greater media scrutiny in the days leading up to the second debate, Clegg appeared to have pulled off another debate victory with post-debate surveys showing him to be the winner again in the eyes of viewers.  A poll by ComRes showed that 33 percent of respondents believed Clegg to be the debate winner; both Brown and Cameron garnered 30 percent respectively.  While Clegg's held a more modest advantage  the second time around, the public's reaction nonetheless demonstrated that he had surpassed the critics' expectations that he would not fare as well, now that the novelty of a viable third choice had worn off.  It was yet to be seen how the third debate, which would focus on the economy,  would affect the impending elections.

In the backdrop appeared to be a growing sense of anxiety among the Conservatives who, until recently, had expected to defeat the incumbent Labour Party and cruise to victory. Now, their anticipated victory was slipping away. In many senses, the meteoric rise of the Liberal Democrats was translating into a far more complicated voting landscape, which would not benefit the Conservatives' fortune at the polls.  Indeed, as noted by Foreign Secretary David Miliband, ""There is deep panic in the Tory ranks and in Tory-supporting newspapers.""Miliband's reference to Tory-supporting newspapers related to a new trend by conservative journals to pillory Clegg over bank account contributions, which ultimately was resolved when the Liberal Democratic leader disclosed all the banking details showing that there was no impropriety.Ironically, as this dissonance was breaking out,  Clegg and the Liberal Democrats had found an unexpected ally in the form of the  Labor Party, which had suddenly jumped to the defense of Clegg.  It was quite likely that Labour was realistic about its prospects at the polls; Labour likely  realized that its only hope of hanging onto power would involve a coalition with the Liberal Democrats.

Fortune smiled on the anxiety-stricken Conservatives at the close of April 2010 when the party leaders participated in the third and final debate.  Tory leader, Cameron, was perceived as having won the debate by 36 percent of those surveyed; 30 percent said Clegg won the debate, while 23 percent said Brown was the debate winner.

The  Angus Reid poll also showed that Tory leader, Cameron, enjoyed the best performance in that debate, and was viewed as ""a better person to handle most economic policy issues."" Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg was viewed as having the best advantage when in came to connecting with undecided voters.  Prime Minister Gordon Brown suffered his  worst performance, despite his warning that a coalition of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats would put the economy ""at risk.""  Brown's debate performance aside, his election prospects were not helped by the fact that around the same time, he referred to a voter as a ""bigot"" spurring controversy, and fueling the flames of suspicion that he had a temperament problem.

Indeed, days ahead of the election, some of the earlier bloom on the Liberal Democrats appeared to have faded with voters returning to their baseline preferences.  Polling data  by ComRes for ITV News and the Independent newspaper at that time showed that the Conservatives had 37 percent support, Labour had 29 percent,  and the Liberal Democrats on 26 percent.  This data appeared in line with survey results from YouGov/Sun showing the Conservatives with 35 percent, Labour with 30 percent, and the Liberal Democrats with 24 percent.

Election Results

With the votes counted, it was clear that the anticipated inconclusive election outcome had come to pass with no party winning a clear majority. The last time a British election produced such a result was in 1974.  In 2010, there were suggestions that the inconclusive election result was tantamount to a no-confidence vote in government at large.  That being said, the Conservatives or Tories were set to become the largest party in parliament, event though they had been denied a parliamentary majority  by the British voters.  As expected, Labour lost their majority and was relegated to the second largest force in parliament.  But with a ""hung parliament"" looming before the United Kingdom, all eyes were on the third place finisher -- the Liberal Democrats -- who were very likely to become the most influential player in the election.

Quick to take control over the public relations aspect of the election result after winning his own constituency, Conservative leader, David Cameron said, ""We have to wait for the full results, but it is clear the Labour government has lost its mandate to govern this country.""  But Foreign Secretary David Miliband of the Labour Party pushed back saying in an interview with British Sky News, ""If no party has a majority in the House of Commons, no party has a moral right to a monopoly of power."" Prime Minister Brown appeared to acknowledge that the election result delivered a message to the Labour Party, but stopped short of suggesting that the message was one of defeat.  He said.  ""The voters have given us an injunction to talk to each other to see if strong and stable government can be secured.""  Meanwhile, Liberal Democratic leader, Nick Clegg, admitted his party's disappointment that his strong debate performance had not translated into more parliamentary seats.  He called on all the political players to ""take a little time"" to ensure people got the government they deserved.

The full results ultimately gave the Tories  306 parliamentary seats --  short of the 326  needed to command control of 650-member House of Commons.  The Labour Party placed second with 258 seats.  The Liberal Democrats secured 57 seats and the right to play kingmaker in the quest for the future government.  Also winning seats were the nationalist Welsh and Scottish parties that could also become crucial players in coalition deal-making that was sure to follow.  As intimated above,  a ""hung parliament"" would necessitate the formation of a coalition government, with the other parties expected to play crucial roles therein.  Absent from that group of likely players was the ultra-right wing British Nationalist Party, often regarded as xenophobic in orientation, which suffered dwindling support at the polls.

Coalition Prospects

In regards to the formation of a coalition government, both Cameron and Brown made it clear that they were looking to the Liberal Democrats for partnership in forming a coalition government. In a clear call for cooperation from Liberal Democratic leader, Clegg, Cameron said, ""I want to make a big, open and comprehensive offer to the Liberal Democrats.""  Cameron also urged a quick government formation process, noting the need to calm volatile markets that were in dire need of stabilizing moves. Meanwhile, Brown made a similar overture to the Liberal Democrats.  For his part, Clegg made clear that the country and not party politics were at stake.  He said, ""It is vital that all parties, all political leaders, act in the national interest and not out of narrow party political advantage.""

Brown signaled quickly that he would welcome a coalition with the Liberal Democrats, and indeed a Labour-Liberal coalition would appear to be the easiest ideological alliance.  For example, the Liberal Democrats and Labour have agreed that spending cuts should not be imposed until a time when economic recovery in the United Kingdom has been advanced.  In contrast, the Conservatives have backed aggressive deficit reduction.But Liberal Democratic-Labour synergy was especially emphasized by the fact that Labour has backed the Liberal Democrats' biggest demand -- that of electoral reform. Indeed, in a bid to show solidarity with the third place finisher, Brown said: ""My view is clear - there needs to be immediate legislation on this to begin to restore the public trust in politics and to improve parliament's standing and reputation, a fairer voting system is central.""

Nevertheless, Brown's cause would not be helped by the fact that Clegg made clear that he was not keen on Brown staying on as prime minister, although he did not dismiss the idea of a coalition with Labour under the stewardship of another leader.  As well, Clegg said that with the Conservatives winning the most seats, they should have the first chance to try to form a government.  But whether or not such a government could include the Liberal Democrats was yet to be seen.  Of concern for the Liberal Democrats has been the Tories' opposition to the notion of electoral reform to a proportional system.  Such a move would practically foreclose political domination of any one party going forward -- an idea that has left the Tories balking in dismay.

Nonetheless, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats entered talks aimed at forging a possible coalition arrangement.  Liberal Democratic leader, Clegg, laid down the proverbial gauntlet as he asserted:  ""It is now for the Conservative Party to prove that it is capable of seeking to govern in the national interest.""His Tory counterpart, Cameron, offered his response saying, ""I want us to work together to tackle the debt crisis, social problems and the broken political system."" It was yet to be seen whether or not these two statements by Clegg and Cameron were signs of a foundation  for a forthcoming coalition.

While both parties characterized their initial talks as ""constructive,"" there remained several unresolved issues. Significantly, Cameron indicated that there would be little room for compromise in areas such as defense, relations with the European Union, immigration, and the timing of public spending cuts. On that latter issue, Cameron said, ""The biggest threat is the deficit. Starting to deal with the deficit this year is essential.""  As well, the aforementioned matter of electoral reform continued to be a sticking point. The Conservatives were making clear electoral reform would only be considered in a committee of inquiry, while the Liberal Democrats were affirming its priority status.

Meanwhile, Prime Minister Brown appeared to acknowledge the reality of the political landscape with the Liberal Democrats first engaging with the Conservatives.  Opening the door for possible talks between the any of the other parties and his Labour Party, Brown said, ""I understand and respect the position of Mr. Clegg in saying he first wishes to make contact with the leader of the Conservative Party."" He continued, ""Mr. Cameron and Mr. Clegg should clearly be entitled to take as much time as they feel necessary. For my part I should make clear I should be pleased to see any of the party leaders.""

Political wrangling was expected to dominate the landscape for the immediate future.  With no written constitution in the United Kingdom, the job was left to senior civil service to craft rules aimed at the government formation process.  At the intra-party level, activists from all three parties were urging the respective leadership branches not to cede excessive accommodation in their discussions with potential coalition partners. Indeed, party loyalists  were concerned about that seizing the levers of power  would come at too high a price to pay -- specifically, in the way of core party principles.

By May 10, 2010, reports had emerged that a deal was in the works between the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives.  Central to that deal was a ""final offer"" by the Conservatives to the Liberal Democrats to  hold a referendum on electoral reform.  Another possible option would be a ""bare minimum"" agreement in which the Liberal Democrats would agree not to bring down the Conservative government in a confidence vote.Whether or not that deal would involve the Liberal Democrats as part of a coalition government, or, as the enablers of an effective minority Conservative government was yet to be seen.

With the Conservatives eagerly seeking to seal the deal via such  overtures, there were suggestions that a new government might be afoot.  Moreover, Clegg , leader of the Liberal Democrats, appeared to place a stamp of approval on the deal-making process.  He said that he was  ""very grateful to David Cameron and his negotiation team"" and noted that the negotiations yielded a ""great deal of progress.""  Nevertheless, Clegg, leader of the Liberal Democrats, sought to calm such speculation, asking instead for patience as the negotiations process was exhausted.  To that end, he said: ""Bear with us a little bit longer and we hope we will be able to provide you with full announcement as soon as possible.""  At the same time, the Liberal Democrats were indicating that they would not shut the door on negotiations with the Labour Party, however, such a move would be contingent upon Brown stepping down as prime minister.

Perhaps in a bid to advance their prospects with the Liberal Democrats, on that same day -- May 10, 2010 -- Gordon Brown announced he would indeed step down as Labour leader and prime minister  by September 2010.  This move made it clear that Brown was inclined to put party and progressive principles before personal ambitions. Indeed, Brown noted that the United Kingdom was home to  a ""parliamentary and not presidential system"" and observed that there was a ""progressive majority"" of voters.  In an attempt to show the Liberal Democrats that he would not be a key player for long, Brownalso said that he would not participate in a forthcoming leadership race within the Labour Party, saying, ""I will play no part in that contest, I will back no individual candidate.""

Clegg of the Liberal Democrats indicated tacit approval of the move saying. ""Gordon Brown has taken a difficult personal decision in the national interest.""This statement came ahead of anticipated negotiations between the Liberal Democrats and Labour, with Clegg noting that such talks would be  ""sensible and in the national interest.""

Political Change: Brown out; Cameron in

On May 11, 2010, it was clear there would be no Labour-Liberal Democratic coalition.  Thus, Gordon Brown resigned as prime minister of the United Kingdom, ending 13 years of Labour rule in that country.In his resignation address to the British people, Brown said,  ""I loved the job not for its prestige, its titles and its ceremony -- which I do not love at all. No, I loved the job for its potential to make this country I love fairer, more tolerant, more green, more democratic, more prosperous and more just - truly a greater Britain.""  It was clear that  the Labour Party would move into the position of being the only progressive option among the major parties on the British political scene.

Brown's resignation paved the way for David Cameron to become prime minister.  To that end, Cameron went to Buckingham Palace to officially accept Queen Elizabeth II's request to form the next government of the United Kingdom, and then entered 10 Downing Street at the country's new prime minister.  David Cameron had the distinction of  being Britain's youngest head of government in about 200 years.

Cameron  lauded Gordon Brown for his years of public service and then gave some indication of the type of leadership to come.  Cameron said that his government's priorities would concentrate of immediate challenges, such as the debt crisis as well as the loss of public trust in the political system.  He warned that ""difficult decisions"" laid ahead, but struck a positive tone saying he looked toward ""better times ahead"" for the British people.Indeed, Cameron said: ""I think the service our country needs right now is to face up to our big challenges, to confront our problems, take difficult decisions, lead people through those decisions, so that together we can reach better times ahead.""

On the matter of the type of government to be formed, it was yet to be determined of Cameron would be at the helm of a minority government, or would hold sway over a majority government with the help of the Liberal Democrats.  To that end, Cameron said his objective was to  form a ""proper and full coalition"" with the Liberal Democrats, in the interests of  ""strong, stable government.""  Cameron added that he hoped he andNick Clegg could ""put aside party differences and work hard for the common good and the national interest.""That being said, Clegg had not yet received majority consent from members of parliament from his party, as well as the federal executive ruling body of the party, to enter a coalition with the Conservatives.

Meanwhile, members of both the Liberal Democrats and Labour began to offer explanations of the failure of their negotiations.  From the perspective of the Liberal Democrats, the talks failed because Labour did not seem seriously invested in forging a reformist-minded, progressive government.  In fact, according to BBC News,  one spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats suggested that core members of the Labour team ""gave every impression of wanting the process to fail.""  The spokesman said that some Labour cabinet ministers ""were determined to undermine any agreement by holding out on policy issues and suggesting that Labour would not deliver on proportional representation and might not marshal the votes to secure even the most modest form of electoral reform.""But on the other side of the equation, Labour suggested that the negotiations were fatally hindered by impediments erected by the Liberal Democrats.  Lord Mandelson of the Labour Party said in an interview with BBC News, that while his party sanctioned the notion of an agreement with the Liberal Democrats, that party ""created so many barriers and obstacles that perhaps they thought their interests lay on the Tory side, on the Conservative side, rather than the progressive side.""

Post-Election Policy AgendaAt the broader level, the issue of economic and financial stability was at stake.  Indeed, the new government would have to deal with formidable challenges as the United Kingdom grapples with recession and budget deficit reduction.

On May 13, 2010, the new coalition government of Prime Minister David Cameron and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg held an unprecedented news conference aimed at delineating its policies, and demonstrating a sense of coalition unity.  At the rhetorical level, Cameron said that the coalition government was emblematic of  a ""historic and seismic shift"" in the  political landscape of the United Kingdom.  He described the alliance as follows:  ""It will be an administration united behind three key principles: freedom, fairness and responsibility.""  He continued, ""And it will be an administration united behind one key purpose ... the strong and stable and determined leadership that we need for the long term.""

At stake would be the practical application of the allied interests of the center-right Conservatives and the center-left Liberal Democrats.  Of particular note was the compromise struck on  the timetable for a reduction of public spending.  To that end, the Liberal Democrats made the concession of signing onto the Conservatives' aggressive agenda to address the United Kingdom's debt woes.Such a move, while necessary in practice, was likely to come with a political cost.  Resultantly, some analysts were casting the new government as a kind of sacrificial lamb that would enact difficult but requisite economic policies.  Such moves, though, could enrage the public and exact a political price in the longer term.Also at stake was the Conservatives' concession to the Liberal Democrats -- electoral reform.  As noted above, agreement was forged on holding a referendum to ratify the proposed alternative voting system to replace the existing ""first past the post"" system.  Should the move be ratified, then voters could specify two candidates in terms of ranking, with the vote for the top choice going to the alternate option if that top choice was ultimately eliminated.  If implemented, the change could boost the presence of smaller party candidates in parliament.  Still, even agreement on a referendum was not reform-minded enough for the Liberal Democrats, however, that party could take heart in changes to be made in the House of Lords where rolling elections would now be implemented.

One controversial proposal by the new coalition has been the plan for  fixed term parliaments.  In essence, the plan would commit a government to a five-year tern, precluding the prime minister from calling an election at any time within a five year period.  While the current threshold for a no-confidence vote to bring down a government has been 50 percent plus one parliamentarian, the new rule would  provide for dissolution with the backing of 55 percent or more in parliament.

In the face of criticism, Cameron characterized the change as a good one.  However, members of his own party, as well as the opposition Labour Party, have railed against it as potentially damaging for democracy.  Indeed, Tory Christopher Chope went further in characterizing the rule change as a ""recipe for anarchy.""  He explained in an interview with the BBC,  ""It could mean, in practice, that if the present government was to lose its majority in parliament, and wasn't able to operate as a minority government because it didn't enjoy the confidence of a sufficient number of MPs ... it would be able to carry on. But that would be basically a recipe for anarchy, because it would mean that the government wouldn't have a majority.""  Labour figures David Blunkett characterized the move as ""a stitch up"" while  Jack Straw said that it was  ""completely undemocratic and totally unworkable.""In terms of representation, the Liberal Democrats were given several important portfolios in Cameron's cabinet, not the least of which was the position of deputy prime minister going to Clegg himself.  Other than Clegg, these included the first secretary to the treasury David Laws, Chris Huhne as energy secretary; and Vincent Cable as business secretary.  That being said, the three key ministerial roles -- finance, foreign affairs and the home office -- were to be held by Conservatives George Osborne, William Hague and Theresa May respectively.

The first test of the new Cameron-Clegg coalition government would come within 50 days with a vote on an emergency budget.  It would be a sign of  whether theoretical concurrence on policy could translate into practical application.  It would also be a harbinger of the likely stability and viability of the Conservative-Liberal Democratic alliance. On May 25, 2010, Queen Elizabeth II presided over the  opening of a  new session of Britain's parliament.  Following tradition, the queen delivered the speech detailing the policy agenda of the incoming government, which is this case was that of the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition.  Consistent with the agreement forged between the two allied parties, that policy agenda included tackling  the country's problematic deficit, restoring economic growth, and establishing a new Office for Budget Responsibility.  There were also plans for certain reforms to the political system, such as a referendum on a new voting system for members of the House of Commons, and, a proposal to make the House of Lords ""wholly or mainly elected,"" according to Queen Elizabeth II. As well, there was the intent to abolish the notion of a national identity card. Encapsulating the thrust of the reformist agenda, the Queen announced: ""My government will propose parliamentary and political reform to restore trust in democratic institutions and rebalance the relationship between the citizen and the state."" Foreign relations were on the agenda months later as the British-based energy company, British Petroleum (BP)was in the news due to a massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. The disaster in Gulf intersected with global politics as BP was subject to increased scrutiny, ultimately resting on the question of whether that company played a role in the early release of the Libyan Lockerbie bomber al-Megrahi (discussed above), and spurring  debate again as to whether or not BP lobbied for his release in exchange for lucrative oil deals in Libya.In fact, BP acknowledged that it had conveyed concern over the slow action being taken to transfer Megrahi out of British jurisdiction and home to Libya. The company stopped short of admitting that it played a part in the release of the terrorist. As well, British Prime Minister David Cameron, in the United States for meetings with President Barack Obama, dismissed a request for a new investigation into the matter. Scottish Secretary, Michael Moore, insisted before the House of Commons that the decision to release the Libyan terrorist was made ""in good faith."" Still, with this scandal brewing, pressure was building on both sides of the Atlantic -- in the United States for a investigation into the allegations against BP related to the bomber's release, and in the United Kingdom for a full and independent inquiry into the bombing itself and the decision to grant a terrorist freedom on compassionate grounds. In the autumn of 2010, following a battle for the leadership of the United Kingdom's Labor Party, Ed Miliband claimed victory at the helm of the country's major opposition party.  Ed Miliband beat out his older, more well-known brother former Foreign Secretary David Miliband, for the party's top post.  For his part, David Miliband said that he would not be involved in Ed Miliband's leadership team, while the new Labor leader made clear that he would be forming his own shadow cabinet without his brother.  On May 6, 2011,  British voters rejected electoral reform in a highly-anticipated referendum.  Up to 69 percent of voters opposed the change whole only 31 percent voted in its favor. At issue were proposed changes from a ""First Past The Post"" (FPTP) system to an ""Alternative Vote"" (AV) system.  While Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron has eschewed this change, it was championed by hiscoalition partner, Nick Clegg of the Liberal Democrats and the referendum itself was a key component of the coalition deal formed between the two parties at the helm of power in the United Kingdom.  Now, with the proposal going down to defeat, a season of discontent was expected to prevail between the two coalition partners.  That coalition was formed in the aftermath of the inconclusive  2010 general election, which brought an end to the 13-year  rule of the Labor Party but gave no party an outright majority to form a government.  Following coalition talks, the Conservatives entered a pact with the center-left Liberal Democrats, and formed a government.  As noted here, the coalition deal was contingent upon the holding of this referendum.  With the vote out of the way and the cause of electoral reform almost lost, Clegg and the Liberal Democrats were being left in a weakened position in relation to Cameron and the Conservatives.  Other Recent Developments  On May 25, 2011, United States President Barack Obama made history by becoming the first United States president to address the British parliament at Westminster Hall. In that speech, President Obama emphasized the strong and enduring bond between the two countries -- the United States and the United Kingdom -- characterizing the trans-Atlantic relationship as ""one of the oldest and strongest alliances the world has ever known."" President Obama also noted that the primacy of the West -- of the United states and allied European countries -- would be ""indispensable"" in the 21st century, given the ascendancy of new world powers, and the spread of democracy. Linking these two themes, President Obama said, ""There are few nations that stand firmer, speak louder and fight harder to defend democratic values around the world than the United States and the United Kingdom.""  British Prime Minister David Cameron, as well as former Prime Minister Tony Blair, former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, and Sir John Major, were in attendance for President Obama's address at Westminster Hall. The reception by British members of parliament and peers to President Obama was extraordinarily warm, with the United States leader receiving extended standing ovations at the start and at the close of the address respectively. The prior night, President Obama and Mrs. Obama were guests of the British monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, and her consort, Prince Phillip, at an official state dinner.June 2011 saw riots rock Northern Ireland's capital of Belfast, with police saying that several hundred people had taken to the streets to participate in sectarian violence. The epicenter of the violence appeared to be a Catholic enclave in the eastern part of the city, which has endured tensions between Catholics and Protestants in the past. Still, with petrol bombs, fireworks, and missiles being hurled at police, and gunshots being fired, it was clearly the worst episode of violence in Belfast in at least a decade.  Several people were reported to have been injured, including a photographer,  and calls for calm had gone unheeded.July 2011 saw a resurgence of sectarian violence as petrol bombs were hurled at police during rioting in the northern part of Belfast.  The explosion of violence occurred at a parade by the Orange Institution, a Protestant fraternal order, in the area of Ardoyne, which is nationalist enclave.  It should be noted that the nationalists are no longer united in Northern Ireland with those loyal to Sinn Fein pledging allegiance to the peace process, and other republicans  who do not.  It would seem that the latter group was involved in the fracas that ensued when riot police took up positions.  Indeed, the presence of riot police  appeared to raise the ire of people on the scene who began to throw stones, glass bottles, bricks, and even petrol bombs at the police as the security forces used water cannons to try to quell the angry crowds.See ""Appendix"" for more information related to Northern Ireland.At the start of August 2011, London was rocked by riots as  young people took to the streets to protest the shooting death of a man in Tottemham  at the hands of police. The situation began when the relatives of Mark Duggan, the man who died in the police raid, decided to participate in a peaceful protest, which  soon turned violent. The situation escalated  when a young man was searched by police who found nothing incriminating in the individual's possession.  Soon, the protesters were embroiled in a rampage of street violence that was stretching from the British capital to parts elsewhere in the country. In London, angry youth set shops and a bus ablaze, threw rocks at police,  and  vandalized police vehicles. Widespread looting was also reported to have taken place.  Bursts of violence erupted in Manchester, the West Midlands, and elsewhere outside of London.

The clashes with police left 35 police officers injured.  By Aug. 11, 2011, more than 1,000  people had been arrested and more than 400 persons had been charged with crimes of violence, disorder, and looting in London.  Elsewhere in the country, more than 330 people were arrested in the West Midlands and about 140 people were arrested in Manchester and Salford.

The uprising by youth appeared to be driven by a sense of outrage over perceived victimization by the Metropolitan Police Force. That is to say, the killing of Duggan may well have tapped into latent frustration from young minority and immigrant communities who have for some time been subject to particular scrutiny by the police over the years.  Certainly, the  Metropolitan Police Force has earned a  notorious reputation for the beating  death of a peaceful protester  as far back as 1979, and the more recent killing of a man by police at the G-20 meetings in 2009. These incidences of apparent injustice were -- to some extent --  linked with broader social and economic grievances; however, the explosion of unrest and violence over a course of days  soon overshadowed any notion of rational explanation or background causal factors.  Indeed, what began as street protests to register discontent over police injustice had effectively been transformed into massive riots, rampant criminality, and a climate of chaos in pockets across the country.

In a perplexing twist, while many youth involved were described as individuals suffering from socio-economic challenges, a good many young people detained were university students pursuing professional paths without previous criminal records.  Those records were set to change since most deemed to have committed crimes would face serious charges in the crown court.

In terms of security, riot police were being deployed across the city to try to quell the violence.  Meanwhile, London's Mayor Boris Johnson and Home Secretary Theresa May were expected to meet with the Metropolitan Police (Met) to determine what action should be taken in regard to the unrest.  For her part,  Home Secretary  May promised the London rioters would  ""be brought to justice"" and would ""face the consequences of their actions.""

British Prime Minister David Cameron returned home from his vacation to monitor the unfolding situation, convened a special meeting of his cabinet,  and initiated an emergency recall of the British Parliament.  In an address to the House of Commons, he placed blame for the unrest gripping the country on ""criminality pure and simple.""  Prime Minister Cameron also noted that the police had initially used ineffectual anti-riot tactics, which may have added to the destruction and harm  suffered by innocent bystanders, homes, and businesses. Prime Minister Cameron additionally acknowledged that ""there were simply far too few police deployed"" on to the streets and ""the tactics they were using weren't working.""More police were being sent to ""hot spot"" areas and the number of security personnel would be boosted with the inclusion of police officers from Scotland to assist in maintaining law and order. The increased deployment of police on the streets of London was expected to remain in place for the immediate future.

With an eye on responding with a firmer hand to the unrest, Prime Minister Cameron said, ""To the law abiding people who play by the rules, and who are the overwhelming majority in our country, I say: the fightback has begun, we will protect you. If you've had your livelihood and property damaged, we will compensate you. We are on your side. And to the lawless minority, the criminals who have taken what they can get, I say this: We will track you down, we will find you, we will charge you, we will punish you. You will pay for what you have done.""

The prime minister said that the authorities were banning the use of face masks, considering limits of social media among people known to be plotting acts of violence, reviewing the implementation of curfews, and readying the use of water cannons to disperse crowds.  Also under consideration was the strengthening of court sentences, the  expansion of powers for landlords to evict criminals from welfare housing, in addition to the introduction of  anti-gang programs.  Prime Minister Cameron emphasized that all efforts would be made  to restore law and order to the streets of the country.  It should also be noted that the prime minister announced a plan to assist and/or compensate people whose homes and businesses were vandalized or destroyed by youth rioters.

The unrest reached into the political dimension, as it drew attention to the Conservative government's plans to cut funding for police as part of the government's overall austerity thrust.  Now, with the exacerbation of the unrest being partially blamed on insufficient police on the streets, questions were being raised about the wisdom of such spending cuts.  In the House of Commons, Labour Party leader, Ed Miliband, called for a reconsideration of the plans to reduce police  saying, ""The events of the last few days have been a stark reminder to us all that police on our streets make our communities safer and make the public feel safer.""  He continued, ""Given the absolute priority the public attaches to a visible and active police presence, does the prime minister understand why they would think it is not right that he goes ahead with the cuts to police numbers? Will he now think again on this issue?""  For his part, Cameron maintained that the cuts could be achieved without reducing the visible presence of police on the streets.On Oct. 14, 2011, British Defense Secretary Liam Fox resigned following a scandal involving one of his closest friends.  Adam Werritty -- a self-proclaimed ""adviser"" to Fox -- was exposed for  funding links to companies that might benefit from government decisions, and was reported to have been granted extremely close access to Fox, even accompanying him on foreign visits of an official nature.  The situation resulted in questions about a conflict of interest for Fox. For his part, Fox said in his letter of resignation, ""I mistakenly allowed the distinction between my personal interest and my government activities to become blurred. The consequences of this have become clearer in recent days. I have also repeatedly said that the national interest must always come before personal interest. I now have to hold myself to my own standard."" The scenario also forced  British Prime Minister  David Cameron  to carry out a cabinet shuffle.  Transport Minister Philip Hammond was given the defense portfolio, while Justice Greening replaced Hammond with the transport portfolio.Special ReportIran under isolation; effects on ties with the United Kingdom  --

Due to revelations about Iran's nuclear development program,  the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  passed a resolution expressing ""deep and increasing concern"" about Iran's nuclear program, and demanded that Iran clarify outstanding questions related the country's nuclear capabilities. The resolution was adopted following a vote at the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency, with 32 votes inits favor and only Cuba and Ecuador voting against it. Iran's IAEA envoy,  Ali Ashgar Soltanieh , dismissed the development and  said the resolution would only strengthen Iran's resolve to go forward with its nuclear development.  He said, ""It will be business as usual... We will continue our work as before.""

While Iran was not on the verge of a declaration of its nuclear breakout capability, clearly, these revelations would serve to reinvigorate the debate about what method could be used to stop Iran from accessing a nuclear weapon. Under consideration would be options ranging from sanctions, to sabotage and military action.  Despite Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's assertion that the report made clear the need for global action to stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons, Russia wasted no time in foreclosing the possibility of its support for fresh sanctions.  With United Nations sanctions unlikely,  on Nov. 21, 2011, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada slapped fresh sanctions on  Iran's financial and energy sectors.In addition to the IAEA resolution discussed above, Iran was also subject to further diplomatic pressure and went further down the road to global isolation when the United Nations General Assembly voted  overwhelmingly in favor of a resolution condemning an alleged assassination plot targeting the Saudi ambassador to the United States. The resolution stopped short of directly accusing Tehran of the plot,  but nonetheless demanded that Iran ""comply with all of its obligations under international law"" and ""co-operate with states seeking to bring to justice all those who participated in the planning, sponsoring, organization and attempted execution of the plot.""

With international pressure being intensified against  Iran, the Iranian regime appeared to be reacting by lashing out at the Western world.  With hostilities already high between Iran and the United States, Tehran appeared to be taking aim at the United Kingdom.  To this end,  by the close of  November 2011, Iran's  Guardian Council of the Constitution unanimously voted to reduce diplomatic ties with the United Kingdom. The change would downgrade diplomatic ties with the United Kingdom from the ambassador level to the level of charge d'affaires within a two-week timeframe. Ratification by the Guardian Council came after a vote in the Iranian Majlis or parliament, approving  this move.  Iranian radio reported that during the vote, several members of parliament changed ""death to Britain.""  Iran was reacting to pressure from Western countries, including the United Kingdom, to place greater political and economic pressure on Iran, and particularly, the Central Bank of Iran, in the wake of the aforementioned report by the IAEA.

In a further sign that Iran's relations with the countries of the West were on a downward slide, Nov. 29, 2011 saw militant students aligned with the hard line conservative government in Tehran storm the British embassy compound.  This action appeared to be part of a violent demonstration against the government of the United Kingdom, which joined the United States in issuing new financial sanctions against Iran.  The militant activists reportedly chanted, ""death to England ,"" vandalized the embassy offices, seized sensitive documents, briefly detained some diplomatic personnel, and burned the British flag in acts that constituted  flagrant violations of diplomatic norms.  A separate attack by militant students and activists on a British diplomatic compound in northern Tehran was also confirmed by the British Foreign Office.  The scenario disturbingly  recalled the shocking assault  on the American Embassy in 1979 following Iran's Islamic Revolution.

Although Iran expressed ""regret"" over the attacks on the British embassy and secondary diplomatic compound, witnesses on the ground in Iran suggested that Iranian security forces did little to quickly end the outbreak of violence against a diplomatic interest.  Indeed, police reportedly allowed the scene to play out for several hours before taking control of the situation.  There were serious allegations mounting that the assault on the British embassy compounds had taken place with approval from Iranian authorities. Furthermore, speculation rested on the involvement of the regime-backed Basiji militia. For his part, British Prime Minister David Cameron said: ""The attack on the British embassy in Tehran today was outrageous and indefensible.""  British authorities warned its citizens in Iran to remain indoors and await advice; they also warned of consequences for Iran in the offing, and summoned the Iranian charge d'affaires.

The United Kingdom on Nov. 30, 2011 officially downgraded its ties with Iran.  The United Kingdom withdrew all its diplomats from Iran, closed its embassy in Tehran, urged its citizens to exit that country, and  gave Iran 48 hours to remove all its staff from the Iranian diplomatic mission in London. Officials in the United Kingdom also went on the record to note that they believe the attacks on the British embassy in Tehran and the secondary compound were carried out with the tacit approval of Iran's leadership. British Foreign Secretary William Hague, asserted that there had been ""some degree of regime consent"" in the attacks on the embassy and the other diplomatic compound in Tehran. Dominick Chilcott, the newly-appointed British ambassador to Iran, said: ""This was a state-supported activity."" In an interview with BBC News, Ambassador Chilcott said that Iran was a country in which an attack on an embassy was conducted only ""with the acquiescence and the support of the state."" These moves collectively marked the worst deterioration of ties between the United Kingdom and Iran in decades.

The United Kingdom was backed by the  15-nation United Nations Security Council, which condemned the attack ""in the strongest terms.""  Separately, United States President Barack Obama called for the Iranian government to ensure those responsible faced justice. Germany's Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle characterized the attacks on the British embassy compounds as ""a violation of international law.""  French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe placed the blame on the Iranian government, saying: ""The Iranian regime has shown what little consideration it has for international  law.""

Several European countries -- such as France, Germany,  Italy and the Netherlands -- wasted no time in joining the Western thrust to diplomatically isolate Iran by recalling their own ambassadors from Tehran.  France took a further step by withdrawing its embassy staff from Iran.  French officials said the move was being made out of an abundance of caution, given the security risks in Iran to Western interests. France's calls for a ban on Iranian oil imports and a freeze on central bank assets was expected to heighten bilateral tensions, and effectively place France in Iran's  firing line, along with the United Kingdom. Russia, which has often been accused by the West of being ""soft"" on Iran joined the condemnation of the attacks.

At home in Iran, militant activist students in that country were  at the airport in Tehran, waiting to welcome the expelled Iranian diplomats from London, and chanting slogans, such as ""Death to Britain.""  The returning diplomats, however, never had any direct encounters with the students at the airport.

The situation appeared to highlight cleavages in the Iranian leadership regarding the diplomatic farrago. For example, in an interview with Iran's state-run IRNA news agency, Grand Ayatollah Naser Makarem Shirazi  said,  ""There is no doubt that Britain is one of the oldest enemies of Iran.""  He appeared to offer a slight rebuke to the militant activists who attacked the British embassy, adding:  ""Young revolutionaries should not go beyond the law.""  Meanwhile, the Iranian government targeted the United Kingdom for exacerbating tensions between that country and the West, as Iranian foreign ministry spokesman, Ramin Mehmanparast, said: ""The British government is trying to extend to other European countries the problem between the two of us.""Special ReportU.K. outside the European Union circle as bloc looks to new financial compact

In the first part of  December 2011, the leaders of the two biggest players in the euro zone -- French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel -- issued a joint call for serious changes to Europe's governing treaties, aimed at ameliorated economic governance for the 17 countries that make up the euro currency bloc. French President Sarkozy and German Chancellor Merkel met for talks on the matter in Paris as the euro zone countries continue to grapple with the sovereign debt crisis, emanating from ""ground zero"" in Greece, but extending regionally across the European bloc.  This crisis  has left the euro vulnerable, risked fragmenting the currency union, and could yet imperil the fragile global economic recovery.

At issue has been the problematic debt to GDP ratio in countries across the euro zone of the European Union (EU), and concomitant anxieties about  various countries, such as Portugal, Spain, Italy and even Ireland,  defaulting on their respective debts. These mostly  southern European economies were plagued not only by high deficits but also inherent structural economic weakness, which could affect other countries in the euro zone in something of a contagion.  While rescue packages for Greece and Ireland were put into effect, such measures forlarger economies, such as Italy and Spain, was simply unaffordable. General expectations were that Spain might barely escape default because its debt-to-GDP ratio -- while poor -- was still better than that of Italy.  But at the broader level, attention began to rest on the need to expand a rescue  fund for  Europe's heavily indebted countries, which in September 2011 led to what is now known as the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF).

While the expansion of the EFSF breathed necessary life into the euro stabilization entity, it should be noted that the treatment for the debt ailment infecting the euro zone has become imbued by controversy. While  the participants of the global economy have been anxious for action to be taken in response to the debt crisis, German stakeholders have been incensed that they would be the major contributors to the rescue fund, which would benefit countries, such as Greece.  Stated differently, the debt crisis in Europe has led not only to instability in the international markets, but also to political imbroglios across the euro zone.

Of equally significant has been the growing chorus of complaints about the slow and protracted political response to the sovereign debt crisis in Europe and theassociated euro zone challenges, which were largely due to the EU's institutional structure.  It was with an eye on addressing that latter issue that French President Sarkozy and German Chancellor Merkel were meeting in Paris to seek a pathway to stabilizing the euro zone.  That meeting resulted in the aforementioned call for radical changes to Europe's governing treaties, characterized by heightened economic governance in the EU.

Included in their proposal were:  (1) the creation of a monetary fund for Europe, (2) automatic penalties for countries that exceed European deficit limits, and (3) monthly meetings of European leaders. The proposal entailed compromises by both European leaders.  President Sarkozy had to accept the notion of automatic sanctions for countries in violation of debt limit rules, while Chancellor Merkel had to accept that the European Court of Justice will not be empowered with the power of veto over budgets.  Meanwhile, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), which was intended to replace the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) in 2013, would be advanced earlier in 2012.

President Sarkozy said that they were looking to March 2012 to complete negotiations on the new treaty.  Ideally, the new treaty would be ratified by all 27 member states of the European Union.  However, if concurrence at that level proved impossible, then the 17 states of the euro zone would have to approve it.  It should also  be noted that European Council President Herman Van Rompuy has said that tougher budget rules for the euro zone may not require changing any existing European Union treaties.

President Sarkozy emphasized the imperative that such a crisis not re-emerge in the future.  He said, ""We are conscious of the gravity of the situation and of the responsibility that rests on our shoulders."" For her part, Chancellor Merkel said her country, working in concert with France, was ""absolutely determined"" to maintain a stable euro.  She also advocated for ""structural changes which go beyond agreements.""

While the new measures would certainly go a long way to addressing the issue of improved economic governance in the euro zone, they did not deal with the question of how many euro zone countries would deal with their debt challenges in a climate of low growth. Nevertheless, in the short run, the steadfast and unified message of intent by the two European leaders was, at least, expected to calm markets and facilitate lower borrowing costs for debt-ridden economies such as Italy, Spain, and Portugal.

The proverbial ""fly in the ointment"" emerged on Dec. 5, 2011 when the credit ratings agency, Standard and Poor's, placed the countries of the euro zone on a ""credit watch"" with negative implications.*  Even power house economies of Germany and France were included in the move, which presaged a downgrade to come in the future.  A day later,  Standard and Poor's even warned that the euro zone bailout fund -- the EFSF -- could lose its own AAA rating.  These moves have raised eyebrows across the world as regards the credibility of the ratings agency, which failed to warn the world of the sub-prime meltdown in 2008 that ultimately let to the global financial crisis.  There were suggestions that this downgrade threat to euro zone countries, in conjunction with the downgrade of the United States months earlier following a particularly ferocious debt ceiling debate in that country, were evidence that the credit ratings agency was trying to ""save face"" by proving its tougher standards at this time.  Standard and Poor's newly-discovered hard-line stance was being questioned by analysts, who pointed to the timing of the warning against euro zone countries. But  this warning came precisely at a time when France and Germany were leading the charge in the EU to solve the regional debt crisis, as discussed here.

The move by Standard and Poor's aside, Europe re-focused on the task at hand: to institute ameliorated economic governance in the EU. By mid-December 2011, 26 out of the 27 EU member states backed the notion of a new tax and budget concord that would amend the Lisbon Treaty -- the EU's operational  and constitutional foundation.Included in the cadre of 26 affirmative countries were all of the 17 euro zone countries. Of course, for many countries, support was contingent upon additional political ratification either in parliament or via referendum. Still, the signals of positive joint action were clear from these 26 countries.

The United Kingdom emerged as the lone ""holdout"" with British Prime Minister David Cameron insisting that he had to act to protect key British interests, including the financial markets.  French President Nicolas Sarkozy noted that the sticking point for Prime Minister Cameron involved a protocol that would allow the United Kingdom to opt-out of  changes on financial services. President Sarkozy said that measure wasunacceptable . Explaining his position, Prime Minister Cameron said, ""We were offered a treaty that didn't have proper safeguards for Britain, and I decided it was not right to sign that treaty.""  He continued by noting that the United Kingdom remained in the EU, saying, ""We're still in the single market.""

Nevertheless, this move by the United Kingdom was an operational veto of the initiative to get all 27 EU countries to support changes to the bloc's Lisbon Treaty.  As intimated above, it would effectively force the EU to go down the road of instituting a ""fiscal compact,""  rather than a new treaty.  While the institution of a fiscal pact could probably occur more quickly than ratification of a new treaty, it would entail far less rigor and strength as a guiding maxim of the EU.

Across Europe, the British government was being criticized for plunging the United Kingdom into a position of isolation, while economic analysts from the Economist and the Financial Times, warned that Europe was now being faced by fragmentation.

In the United Kingdom, the move by Prime Minister Cameron was creating tensions within his own coalition government.  Notably, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg -- the leader of the Liberal Democrats --  said that David Cameron's veto of EU treaty changes was ""bad for Britain"" and he warned that it could leave his country  ""isolated and marginalized"" in Europe. He continued, ""I don't think that's good for jobs, in the city (re: London) or elsewhere, I don't think it's good for growth or for families up and down the country.""  Clegg's bitter denunciation of the veto by Cameron exposed fissures in the British ruling coalition between the Conservative Euro-skeptics and the pro-European Liberal Democrats.  The Labour Party -- the main political opposition in the United Kingdom -- was more scathing in its rebuke of Cameron's decision. Labour leader, Ed Miliband, said of Cameron: ""He did this because the Euro-skeptic wing of the Conservative Party has effectively taken over and that isn't good for the national interest."" Miliband also appeared to encourage the Liberal Democrats to look to Labour to overturn the decision as he said: ""What I say to Liberal Democrats and others is that we will work with anybody who thinks this position can not stand. We must find a better way forward for Britain."" By the start of 2012, 25 of the 27 European Union member states agreed to join the new fiscal agreement.  The two holdouts were the United Kingdom  and the Czech Republic.Earlier in late 2011  (as discussed here), British Prime Minister David Cameron said that his country would not sign on to the notion of a new treaty, and effectively forced the European Union to go down the road of instituting a ""fiscal compact,""  rather than a new treaty.  But now in 2012, the United Kingdom was continuing its opposition, and said that the compact would threaten British interests and that there were ""legal concerns"" about the use of European Union institutions in enforcing the fiscal compact. Meanwhile, the  Czechs said that there were ""constitutional reasons"" for their refusal to sign on to the compact.  At issue was the fact thateuro skeptic President  Vaclav Klaus has been a vocal opponent to the compact. *Note: In January 2012, the credit ratings agency, Standard & Poor's, downgraded the status of a number of European countries.The stability of the euro zone and the European Union has become a major concern in recent years, largely emanating from the Greek debt crisis, but extending regionally, as discussed here. Political Update (2010-2012): After coming to power following close parliamentary elections in May  2010, the Conservatives formed a ruling coalition with the Liberal Democrats.  Now, more than two years later in April 2012, polling data has found that the bloom was off the proverbial rose and British voters were now disenchanted with both ruling parties.  Conversely, the opposition Labor Party, which lost the control of government in those elections, was enjoying a reversal of fortune as the favored political party in the country.  According to a YouGov-Sun poll,  Labor had a lead of 11 percentage points ahead of the Conservatives or ""Tories."" Another poll  by Populus for The Times of London showed showed similar results with Labor ahead of the Tories by nine  percentage points. The Liberal Democrats were slipping the most precipitously  with the  Euro-skeptic United Kingdom Independence Party edging into the third place slot in terms of popularity.

One of the policy issues that may have contributed to the ascendancy of Labor, along with the associated erosion of support for the Tories and the Liberal Democrats, included the  budget put forth by Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne.  At issue were policies such as the so-called granny tax that infuriated retirees, as well as the ""pasty tax,"" which would involve a value-added tax on hot ""takeout"" food, and adversely affect wide swaths of the population.  Also of concern was the proposal to  expand value added taxes on repairs to listed historic buildings, which would affect the Church of England.

Policy aside, the ruling coalition of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats was experiencing cleavages at the end of April 2012.  At issue was the announcement by British Prime Minister David Cameron that a referendum be held on converting the House of Lords to a largely elected body. This move  evoked the tensions of  Liberal Democrat leader, Nick Clegg, who pointed to the fact that all three of the country's main political parties promised reform of the upper house of parliament during  the 2010 election campaign.  Clegg said that those campaign commitments should make a referendum unnecessary.  But in an  interview with BBC News, Prime Minister Cameron appeared unwilling to step away from the notion of a ratification vote saying, ""My view is that you shouldn't rule it out.""

Political challenges for Prime Minister Cameron continued as April 2012 came to a close.  At issue was the status of his  Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt.  At issue was Hunt's involvement in News  Corp.'s bid to acquire BSkyB. Specifically, Hunt was accused of being improperly involved with the deal -- a claim that came to light  after the Leveson Inquiry released e-mails between Hunt's special adviser, Adam Smith, and News Corp. Public Affairs Director Frederic Michel. The details of the email led to Smith's resignation but have so far left Hunt unaffected. For his part, Prime Minister Cameron said: ""I don't think it would be right in every circumstance if a special adviser gets something wrong to automatically sack the minister. I think he's doing an excellent job on the Olympics and, frankly, I do think people deserve to have these things looked into properly.""Editor's Note on the Monarchy:The year 2012 saw the ruling monarch of the United Kingdom, Queen Elizabeth II, mark the 60th anniversary of her accession to the throne.  While the official celebration of Queen Elizabeth's six-decade long rein as the United Kingdom's ruling monarch was to be held mid-year, the official date of accession was at the start of February 2012. of course, the date also marks the commemoration of the death of her father, the beloved KingGeorge VI.  Queen Elizabeth II said that she was  dedicating herself ""anew"" to the service of the British people and that she  was ""deeply moved"" by the massive outpouring of popular support for her Diamond Jubilee.  Those Jubilee celebrations ensued in the summer of 2012.  Elizabeth II joins her great-great grandmother, Queen Victoria, as the only other British monarch to achieve this milestone.

Special Report:  London 2012 -- The Games of the XXX OlympiadLondon -- the capital city of the United Kingdom -- welcomed the world on July 27, 2012, at the start of the Games of the XXX Olympiad. The Opening Ceremony on July 27, 2012, was witnessed by 80,000 people in Olympic Stadium as well as up to one billion people watching via broadcast across the world.  That ceremony culminated with the symbolic lighting of the Olympic Cauldron from the Olympic flame that has journeyed across the host country of the United States for the previous months.  National and international dignitaries, including the reigning monarch of the United Kingdom - Queen Elizabeth II - would be in attendance. Ahead of the ceremony, Big Ben -- one of London's landmark features -- rang for three minutes.  It was the first such tribute to the historic nature of the event since the funeral of King George VI in 1952.

While attention on July 27, 2012, would rightly be on the highly-anticipated Opening Ceremony, which was being coordinated by Oscar-award winning film director Danny Boyle, the preparation for 2012 Olympics had been ongoing for several years, with attention to appropriate infrastructure, facilities, logistics, and security in one of the world's largest and most dynamic cities. Of particular note has been the revitalization effort of East London, which  International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge lauded, saying that leaves London with a ""tangible legacy"" of the Games of the XXX Olympiad.  While these costly and inconvenient preparations often raised the ire of Londoners in the period leading up to the 2012 Olympics, now most citizens appeared to be proud and excited about the historic event on their home country, with crowds dressed in national colors in a rare extroversion of patriotism.

Speaking in a tone of national pride, United Kingdom Prime Minister David Cameron said of the London Olympics, ""It's a great opportunity to show the world the best of Britain, a country that's got an incredibly rich past but also a very exciting future."" Former United Kingdom Prime Minister Tony Blair, who served as head of government in 2005 when London won the right to host the Olympics,  said in an interview with BBC News: ""It's a party atmosphere but also an immense sense of national pride -- of what we are and what we can show the world.""  London Mayor Boris Johnson spoke of the so-called ""Olympic fever"" spreading across the city in an interview with the BBC, saying, ""What's so amazing is just the wave of excitement seems to pass from person to person like some benign form of contagion. Everybody is getting it.""

The London 2012 Olympics included participation from about 10,000 athletes representing about 200 countries or national entities (operating under the aegis of National Olympic Committees).  The athletes would compete in 26 sports, further sub-divided into 39 disciplines.

Visitors from across the world were present in London -- arguably the world's most cosmopolitan capital city already -- in a show of global goodwill  and enthusiasm. The premise of the modern Olympics have been to provide a venue for  individuals, rather than states or nations, to compete against each other in sports held every four years, and in peaceful competition, without the burden of politics, war, ethnicity, or religion.

The ancient Olympics -- the roots of the modern Olympics -- can  trace their origins to the eighth century before the common era (B.C.E.). The games were dedicated to the 12 Olympian Gods and were hosted on the ancient green plains of Olympia.  Those games in Greek antiquity constituted a time of union, where athletes from across the Greek world came together to compete for the prize of the olive wreath and would return to their home city-states marked as heroes.  Political and religious dynamics -- such as the conquest by the Romans and accusations about the Pagan connection to the games' origins in the post-Christian world -- contributed to the demise of the Olympics. They were revived as the modern Olympics in the late 19th century by the French Baron Pierre de Coubertin in the late 19th century.

Coubertin's background in philosophy and education informed his emerging advocacy for sports.  Particularly, he drew upon the notion of competition among amateurs rather than professional athletes. The legacy of a political truce during the ancient games also imbued its own flavor onto the modern games, influencing the emerging understanding of the Olympics as an international venue to promote peace and spread cultural understanding. These ideals have been transposed into the purpose of the modern Olympics that go forth in contemporary times.  Indeed, according to the Olympic Charter, the Olympic Games are competitions between athletes in individual or team events and not between countries. Moreover, as expressed in the Olympic Creed: ""The most important thing in the Olympic Games is not to win but to take part, just as the most important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle. The essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well.""

It should be noted that contentious politics and shocking world events have, occasionally, often crept into the domain of this international sporting event.  There have been boycotts including that of African countries to protest apartheid in South Africa in the 1970s, and the Cold War boycotts of the Moscow and Los Angeles games in the 1980s. There was also the domestic terrorist bombing at the  Atlantic games of 1996. Perhaps more importantly, there was the notorious massacre of Israeli athletes by Palestinian terrorists at the Munich Olympics in 1972.

In these London 2012 Olympics, a Greek athlete, Paraskevi Papachristou, was expelled from the games ahead of the opening ceremony because of a racist Twitter message.  As well, United States Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney set off a blaze of controversy when he questioned London's readiness for the 2012 Olympics, during a trip intended to burnish his foreign policy credentials against incumbent President Barack Obama.  Such incidences aside, attention of the world was quickly refocused on the Olympics themselves, and the rare opportunity for the world to come together to compete in the interests of sport and amity.

The closing ceremony of the Games of the XXX Olympiad would commence on Aug. 12, 2012, and include a handover by London Mayor Boris Johnson to Eduardo Paes, Mayor of Rio de Janeiro -- the host city of the 2016 Olympics.Special Report:

Ecuador grants asylum to WikiLeaks founder; U.K. threatens to storm embassy On Aug. 16, 2012, the government of Ecuador announced it would grant asylum to Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks.  In June of 2012, Assange took refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy  in the United Kingdom to avoid extradition.  Now, months later,  the United Kingdom was making it abundantly clear that Assange would not be granted safe passage out of the country. WikiLeaks is an online database of leaked classified documents and private diplomatic cables from government sources, news organizations, and whistleblowers. Launched in 2006 by Assange, an Australian Internet activist, WikiLeaks  has led to outrage across the world, embarrassment for several governments,  and accusations that the dissemination of classified materials constitutes to a threat to global security. Assange's personal legal problems (as regards to alleged sexual offenses in Sweden) has been viewed as the means to apprehend him, with the possibility of extradition to the United States to face charges related to WikiLeaks' publication of private diplomatic cables. To these ends, and with news emerging that Ecuador was providing sanctuary to Assange via its embassy in London, the United Kingdom wasted little time in warning that it would fulfill its ""obligation"" to extradite Assange.  Indeed, the United Kingdom did not foreclose the possibility of storming the Ecuadorian embassy in London. In response, Ecuadorian Foreign Minister Ricardo Patino said during a news conference:  ""Today we received from the United Kingdom the express threat, in writing, that they could assault our embassy in London if Ecuador didn't hand over Julian Assange. We want to make this absolutely clear. We are not a colony of Britain."" But the United Kingdom was in no mood to back down, posting a message via social media that read: ""We have consistently made our position clear in our discussions with the government of Ecuador. U.K. has a legal obligation to extradite Mr. Assange to Sweden to face questioning over allegations of sexual offenses."" The Foreign Office continued,  ""Throughout this process we have drawn the Ecuadorians' attention to relevant provisions of our law. For example, extensive human rights safeguards in our extradition procedures, or to legal status of diplomatic premises in the U.K."" Amping up the rhetoric, United Kingdom Foreign Secretary William Hague said, ""Under our law, with Assange having exhausted all options of appeal, the British authorities are under a binding obligation to extradite him to Sweden. We must carry out that obligation and, of course, we fully intend to do so.""  Explaining that the United Kingdom was not bound by legal instruments requiring the recognition of diplomatic asylum by a foreign embassy, Hague  said that diplomatic asylum ""should not be used for the purposes of escaping the regular processes of the courts."" For his part, Assange himself entered the debate on Aug. 19, 2012, when he appeared on the balcony of the Ecuadorian embassy and offered a statement. In that statement, he urged the United States to end its ""witch-hunt"" against Wikileaks.  He specifically demanded that the United States stop going after whistleblowers, saying: ""The United States must pledge before the world that it will not pursue journalists for shining a light on the secret crimes of the powerful."" Assange also  called for the release of Bradley Manning, who faces trial due to  accusations that he [Manning] leaked the classified documents to  Wikileaks.  Note that as the end of August 2012 was near, the diplomatic standoff between the United Kingdom and Ecuador came to a close.Ecuador's President Correa announced that the United Kingdom had  withdrawn its threat to enter Ecuador's embassy in London to arrest Assange.  Ecuador's government said  it had received  a message from the British Foreign Office confirming that ""there was no threat to enter the embassy.""  Special Note on the Monarchy  At the start of December 2012, legal measures were underway to change the rule of royal succession.  At issue was the prevailing principle of male primogeniture, by which male heirs take precedence over women in line to the British throne. The new measures were intended to ensure that the first born of monarch would be the heir apparent, regardless of gender. The new measures would  effectively  end the dictate that privileges males over females in the line of succession and ensure that the first child of the current Duke and Duchess of Cambridge would become monarch, whether that offspring is a boy or a girl.  To that end, all Commonwealth realms concurred with the proposed legislation, facilitating the path for the British parliament to introduce the  new Succession to the Crown Bill in the House of Commons.  That succession bill would require certain amendments to constitutional documents, including the Bill of Rights and Coronation Oath Act of 1688.  Passage of the legislation would come at a time when the Duchess Catherine of Cambridge was hospitalized for acute morning sickness, or hyperemesis gravidarum, ahead of the birth of the child who would be third in line to the throne after Heir Apparent Prince Charles and the Duke William of Cambridge respectively. It should be noted that the Succession to the Crown Bill  would also end the prohibition of anyone in the line of succession from marrying a Roman Catholic.  Special Note on Economy

In the last week of February 2013, the credit ratings agency, Moody's, downgraded the United Kingdom from its top AAA rating to AA1. It was the first downgrade since 1978.  Moody's said that the United Kingdom's austerity measures were contributing to subdued growth, and that the British government's debt reduction program faced significant challenges, cautioning the United Kingdom's debt burdens were not likely to be reversed until 2016 anyway. Moody's further said that all expectations were that  growth would ""remain sluggish over the next few years."" Still, Moody's maintained that the United Kingdom's outlook was stable.

The downgrade did not appear to deter the conservative government from following the path of austerity. Instead, Chancellor George Osborne said that Moody's decision was ""a stark reminder of the debt problems facing our country.""  He continued, ""Far from weakening our resolve to deliver our economic recovery plan, this decision redoubles it.  We will go on delivering the plan that has cut the deficit by a quarter.""  Shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, wasted no time in blasting the government for its measures.  He said the decision by Moody's to downgrade the United Kingdom's credit rating was a ""humiliating blow to a prime minister and chancellor who said keeping our AAA rating was the test of their economic and political credibility.""

Special Entry: Death of Britain's  conservative ""Iron Lady"" Margaret Thatcher On April 8, 2013, Baroness Margaret Thatcher died following a stroke at the age of 87 years.  The conservative icon, known as the ""Iron Lady,""  served as the United Kingdom's prime minister for 11 years, starting in 1979. Thatcher has been regarded as a transformational figure, not only on the British political landscape, but also socio-politically across the world in modern times. As the first female head of government of a major world power, Thatcher was culturally regarded as a trailblazer for women in politics.  And on the matter of policy, her austere and hardline conservative outlook shifted the British political and economic scene by breaking open the path towards greater privatization. As well, her alliance with former United States President Ronald Reagan has been credited with ending the Cold War. At home, she was lauded for leading the charge to win the war with Argentina over the Falkland Islands in 1982. Her record as a female leader and champion of capitalism and democracy aside, Thatcher's domestic policy record has to be understood as deeply divisive.  Indeed, her poll tax proposal and anti-union policies led to protests, and ultimately to her exit from the leadership faction of the Conservative Party.  It could also be argued that Thatcher stood on the wrong side of history in the international realm as regards apartheid South Africa. She did not back sanctions against apartheid South Africa and infamously referred to Nelson Mandela's African  National Congress (ANC) as ""a typical terrorist organization."" This mixed record aside, Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron paid tribute to Thatcher's legacy, characterizing her as ""a great Briton."" He said, ""Margaret Thatcher succeeded against all the odds. The real thing is she didn't just lead our country; she saved our country.""  Queen Elizabeth II expressed sadness over the news of Thatcher's death, while United States President Obama  noted that ""America has lost a true friend."" Meanwhile the Union Jack at Number 10 Downing Street was being flown at half mast, and the country prepared to say goodbye to her at a formal funeral at London's St Paul's Cathedral, where she would be accorded full military honors. Special Note on Attack by Islamic Extremists in London In the last week of May 2013, two men attacked and brutally murdered a British soldier in the south eastern London suburb of Woolwich.  The victim was identified as Lee Rigby, while his two attackers were identified as Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale -- British citizens of Nigerian descent who were adherents of Islam. The two men did not seem eager to flee the scene of their vicious and bloody assault on Rigby; instead witnesses on the scene were able to film one of the two suspects justifying the murder of British soldiers on the basis of the fact that they killed Muslims during the course of their military duties abroad. The grizzly attack on Rigby notwithstanding, Adebolajo was shown on the footage claiming, ""These people are mistreating us, we are innocent.""  Both Adebolajo and Adebowale  were reported to be in police custody.

While British citizens awaited news over what type of charges the two men would ultimately face, the British Foreign Office soon acknowledged that Adebolajo was given consular assistance when he was arrested in Kenya in 2010.  It was now believed that  Adebolajo had been in Kenya en route to Somalia where he may have intended to join the al-Qaida affiliated terror group, al-Shabab.The British government would undoubtedly face criticism for their consular assistance to an individual with terrorist connections. Special Note on Northern Ireland It should be noted that sectarian violence erupted in Northern Ireland in January 2013 as a result of a contentious debate over flying the British flag at City Hall in Belfast.  Officials voted to limit the number of days the British flag might be flown at City Hall.  The decision spurred outrage by loyalists  and sparked an outbreak of riots, which were marked by violent clashes between protesters and police that left more than 100 police officers dead and as many as 120 arrests made.  A banned loyalist group, the Ulster Volunteer Force, was blamed for fueling the ire of people and even orchestrating some of the riots and  chaos that ensued as a result of the outrage.  With passions inflamed and a rising casualty list in what was now being called the ""Union Flag crisis,"" government ministers convened talks with the Northern Ireland secretary of state and the Irish foreign minister.Secretary of State Theresa Villers then released a statement that read as follows: ""The violence is intolerable and these protests have to come off the streets. They have to be replaced by dialogue.""  Meanwhile,  a number of political groups from varied backgrounds echoed the call for an end to the violence.  Indeed, appeals for an end to the crisis were backed and sanctioned by dozens of organizations, including loyalist entities,  Irish paramilitary cadres, community groups, and church leaders. In mid-July 2013, the capital of Northern Ireland -- Belfast -- was rocked by riots. On July 12, 2013, alone, more than 30 police officers and member of parliament, Nigel Dodds, were injured in the violence unfolding in Belfast. Indeed,  despite his appeal for calm and an end to the violence, Dodds was knocked unconscious when loyalists hurled missiles in the direction of the police.  He was hospitalized at the Royal Victoria Hospital as a result of the incident. At issue was a ban on a proposed march by the Orange Order (i.e. the Protestant unionist movement).  Police moved to enforce that ban but were met with resistance in the northern part of the city as the Orange Order called for mass protests along the thoroughfare that divided Republican (Catholic Irish nationalist) and Orange Order (Protestant unionist) communities.  Although the Orange Order subsequently said it would suspend its demonstrations, violence nonetheless erupted and engulfed families and children.  Weapons ranging from bricks and stones to petrol bombs and ceremonial swords were hurled at police; in response, police attempted to disperse the crowds  by using water cannons and  plastic batons. Typically, Orange men march from April to August, with particular attention on the July 12 date, which marks the occasion when William of Orange won victory over the Catholic King James II at the Battle of the Boyne in Ireland in 1690. The July 12 annual parade  commemorates that victory. For Catholic Irish nationalists, the marches, and particularly, the July 12 parade, denotes triumphalism.  As such, power brokers have noted that they serve only to stoke sectarian and political tensions  between Catholic nationalists and Protestant loyalists.  The decision to ban the parade in northern Belfast was intended to prevent an outbreak of violence but resulted in outraging unionists and particularly the Orange Order, ultimately resulting with  the riots discussed here.  The rioting went on for a second day, with hundreds of police being deployed to quell the violence. Although the unrest continued on July 13, 2013, the violence was not as acute as the day before.  Authorities appeared to blame the Unionists for using reckless language and behavior to spark hostilities. Secretary of State Theresa Villiers ""utterly condemned"" the rioting and urged the Orange Order to call off its mass action saying, ""It is the clear responsibility of everyone who has influence, including the Orange Order, community leaders and politicians, to do what they can to calm the situation. We need temperate language over coming days.""  But unionists were quick to defend their ranks with Ulster Unionist councilor Mark Cosgrove suggesting that it was ""irresponsible"" of police  to blame the Orange Order for the unrest.  He said, ""There were hundreds of thousands of people from both the loyal orders and the bands, the supporters out in Belfast and all over Northern Ireland yesterday and, I think, to try and apportion blame to the Orange Order is totally wrong.""  Not surprisingly, nationalists had a very different view of the events unfolding in Belfast. Martin McGuinness of Sinn Fein said: ""In my opinion, the leadership of the Orange Order failed the Orange Order and they failed these communities."" He continued, ""The decision announced some hours ago, that they are suspending their protests, was a massive admission by themselves that they were culpable for what happened here last night.""  Just ahead of the ""marching season"" in Northern Ireland in 2014, police were investigating a 1972 murder arrested Irish nationalist leader, Gerry Adams.  He was released following several days of extensive interrogations.  At issue for the police was  the murder of Jean McConville, who was kidnapped in full view of her children in 1972 when the Irish Republican Army was carrying out its violent and hardline nationalist campaign.  In the background of this particular investigation were prevailing  accusations that Adama was involved in the Irish Republican Army's more nefarious activities.  For his part, Adams has denied being involved in the murder of anyone -- including McConville.  Regardless of the veracity of his statement,  the police referred the case against Adams -- a member of parliament in the Republic of Ireland -- to prosecutors who would decide whether charges should be advanced.But the investigation into Adams appeared to have sparked sectarian tensions between Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland with supporters of Adams' Sinn Fein party outraged over his arrest, and pro-unionists angry that he was released from police custody. Indeed, unionists blockaded a road and threw petrol bombs to register their anger over Adams' release.While the tensions did not immediately contribute to a fierce outbreak of violence, there were fears that the overall political climate was negatively affected ahead of the so-called ""marching season.""  The summer ""marching season"" typically featured Protestants parades marking their historic victories against Catholics. Of particular importance was the July 12 march marking the victory of  William of Orange over the Catholic King James II at the Battle of the Boyne in Ireland in 1690.For their part, Catholics regard the  parades as provocations and they have been particularly incensed over the July 12 march, saying that it smacked of triumphalism. As such, power brokers have noted that the  parades serve only to stoke sectarian and political tensions  between Catholic nationalists and Protestant loyalists.  The decision  in 2013 to ban the parade in northern Belfast was intended to prevent an outbreak of violence but instead managed to outrage the unionists and particularly the Orange Order. Ultimately,  violent riots erupted in Belfast in 2013. Indeed, it was the worst outbreak of violence in Northern Ireland since the late 1990s.Now in 2014, with the Gerry Adams case featuring prominently ahead of the marching season, anxieties were elevated along with renewed Catholic versus Protestant tensions.2014 Political UpdateAt the start of February 2014, Minister of Immigration Mark Harper of the United Kingdom resigned from office amidst revelations that he employed an illegal immigrant  as a house cleaner at his home.The discovery that Harper -- a  Conservative member of parliament and immigration minister since 2012  -- had employed  a worker in the United Kingdom illegally to clean his home caused an embarrassing quasi-scandal, reflecting negatively on Prime Minister David Cameron's government.  Of note was the fact that the Cameron government was trying to stave off a threat from the anti-immigration far right flank by promising to reduce immigration.  This revelation about the immigration minister employing an illegal immigrant undoubtedly cast a negative light on the Cameron government's seriousness on the issue.As a result, Harper announced his resignation from his cabinet post, although he would continue to function as a member of parliament. In his resignation letter to Prime Minister Cameron, Harper insisted that he had, in fact,  checked the cleaner's immigration status when he first employed her in 2007.  He added, ""When you then appointed me as Immigration Minister ... I went through a similar consideration process and once again concluded that no further check was necessary.""  According to Harper, the problem was that he had not checked the worker's credentials more ""thoroughly.""For his part,  Prime Minister Cameron, whose Conservative Party was languishing in pre-election polls, accepted Harper's resignation saying, ""There is no suggestion that Mr. Harper knowingly employed an illegal immigrant.""In April 2014, United Kingdom's Culture Minister Maria Miller was forced to resign from office amidst an emerging scandal over her expense accounts.  At issue were allegations that Miller over-claimed mortgage costs and other expenses amounting to as much as  45,000 pounds ($75,400). She was cleared of the allegation that she used her expense allowance to fund her parents, however, the other accusations appeared to hold merit. The issue of expense accounts by politicians has been a controversial one in the United Kingdom since 2009 when legislators' expense reports were leaked to the press thus exposing gross abuse.At the political level, the resignation of Miller exposed  United Kingdom Prime Minister David Cameron to criticism over his bad judgment and political leadership. Cameron's critics excoriated him for his failure to take charge of the situation by simply sacking Miller from the onset.  Instead, Cameron clung to the fact that Miller was cleared of one -- but not all -- of the allegations against her (as discussed above), and continued to tout Miller as being an excellent public servant. For her part, Miller prevailed for some time, hanging onto her portfolio and delivering a weak apology that only did further damage to the already dismal image of the Conservative Party.  Ultimately, Miller bowed to public pressure and resigned from office, saying that she believed the scandal was becoming a distraction from the work of the government.Opposition parties wasted little time in casting the Conservatives (also known as ""Tories"") as elitist and out of touch with the common populace. As stated by Labor leader, Ed Miliband, of Prime Minister Cameron: ""He still doesn't understand what she (Miller) did wrong..."" Miliband continued, ""The reason the public was so appalled was if it had happened in any other business there would have been no question about them staying in their job. Why was he the last person in the country to realize her position was untenable?""Note:  Prime Minister Cameron named  Sajid Javid -- a rising star in the Conservative Party -- as the person to replace Miller as the new Culture Minister. Prime Minister Cameron also announced other cabinet changes such as the appointment of Nicky Morgan as financial secretary at the Treasury, and the appointment of Andrea Leadsom as  the new Economic Secretary.In July 2014, United Kingdom (U.K.)  Foreign Secretary William Hague announced his resignation as the  country's top diplomat after four years at that post.  He was set to assume the position of Leader of the House of Commons where he would be tasked with coordinating relations between the executive government and the lower parliamentary chamber.  Via the social media outlet, Twitter, Hague wrote: ""Tonight I am standing down as Foreign Secretary after 4 years to serve as Leader of the House of Commons.""  The move was part of a cabinet shuffle undertaken by Prime Minister David Cameron. That overhaul of the cabinet appeared to be in preparation for parliamentary elections, which were scheduled to be held in 2015.A year ahead of those elections, it was not Prime Minister Cameron's governing Conservatives who had the edge, but the opposition Labour Party. Led by Ed Miliband, Labour was  in the lead in terms of voters' preferences by about four percentage points ahead of the Conservatives.  That being said, Miliband was being weighed down by the fact that most British voters did not view him as a future prime minister.  At issue for Miliband was the public's perception that he was socially awkward, overly-intellectual, and a clear contrast to telegenic Cameron, whose public relations background aided his self presentation style. Cognizant of this contrast,  Miliband took on his ""image"" problem in a direct fashion, saying that if the focus was on policies and substance rather than photo opportunities and superficialities, he would have no trouble leading his left-leaning Labour Party to victory.In a speech to supporters, Miliband said, ""David Cameron is a very sophisticated and successful exponent of a politics driven by image. I am not going to be able to compete with that. And I don't intend to. I want to offer something different.""  He continued, ""If you want the politician from central casting, it's just not me, it's the other guy. And if you want a politician who thinks that a good photo is the most important thing, then don't vote for me ... I believe people would quite like somebody to stand up and say there is more to politics than the photo-op.""Special Note on Northern IrelandIn the second week of September 2014, Ian Paisley, the former leader of Northern Ireland's  Democratic Unionist Party died at the age of 88. Known for his decision to enter a power-sharing executive with the Irish nationalist Sinn Fein movement at Stormont, Paisely was one of the keystone figures of the decades-long struggle between unionists and republican nationalists in Northern Ireland. United Kingdom Prime Minister David Cameron paid tribute to Paisley saying he was ""one of the most forceful and instantly recognizable characters in British politics for nearly half a century."" Cameron continued, ""In particular, his decision to take his party into government with Sinn Fein in 2007 required great courage and leadership, for which everyone in these islands should be grateful.""  Martin McGuinness of Sinn Fein expressed sadness over the news of Paisley's death, saying, ""Over a number of decades we were political opponents and held very different views on many, many issues but the one thing we were absolutely united on was the principle that our people were better able to govern themselves than any British government."" He continued, ""I want to pay tribute to and comment on the work he did in the latter days of his political life in building agreement and leading unionism into a new accommodation with republicans and nationalists.""Special Report on Scottish Independence:The Union holds as Scotland votes ""no""  in landmark independence referendum --Summary:A referendum on Scottish independence was held on Sept. 18, 2014.  The referendum posed  the following question: ""Should Scotland be an independent country?"" Scotland's future status was at stake.  In the months leading up to the independence vote, the pro-unity side of the debate had the advantage; however, in the weeks just before the referendum was set to take place, nationalist passions flared to the benefit of the pro-independence flank.  Pre-referendum polling data showed a close race to the finish with the current structure of the United Kingdom poised for possible transformation.  Would that transformation be limited to increased autonomy within the preserved United Kingdom, or would that transformation see a fully independent Scotland emerge on the global scene?  The answer to these questions came democratically on Sept. 18, 2014, with a decisive ""no"" to independence and in favor of holding together the United Kingdom.  That being said, there would be changes afoot for increased self-determination for Scotland under the aegis of a unified British nation state. With a voter turnout rate of between 85 and 90 percent, the Scottish independence vote stood as a reminder to the world of how participatory democracy works in a mature nation state.Background:Going back to February 2013, the  Scottish National Party  declared that if voters ratified sovereignty and independence in a referendum to be heldin 2014, Scotland would become an independent country in March 2016.  Scottish nationalists released an ambitious timetable for independence that included a detailed itinerary of measures to be undertaken that would remove Scotland from the United Kingdom, establish a separate Treasury, and apply for accession to the European Union in less than 20 months after ratification.A year later in February 2014, with an independence referendum set to be held in September 2014, the government of the United Kingdom made an impassioned plea for Scotland to stay within the union.At the start of 2014, Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron said, ""We would be deeply diminished without Scotland.""  He continued, ""If we lost Scotland, if the U.K. changed, we would rip the rug from under our own reputation. The plain fact is we matter more in the world together.""  If his positive and affirmative message of unity failed to resonate with Scottish nationalists, Prime Minister Cameron was also willing to argue for a unified country on the basis of negative consequences.  To that particular end, his government warned that an independent Scotland would not be able to use the British pound sterling as its currency.The Liberal Democratic Party (in a coalition government with Prime Minister Cameron's Conservatives), as well as the opposition Labor Party, joined the Conservatives in issuing a warning to Scottish nationalists.  Regardless of their partisan divisions, all three parties closed ranks to caution Scottish nationalists that an independent Scotland would be prohibited from retaining the British pound sterling as its currency.  As noted by the United Kingdom's Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, ""There's no legal reason why the rest of the U.K. would need to share its currency with Scotland.""The pro-independence Scottish National Party (SNP) seemed undeterred by the threat, casting it as just an attempt ""to bully and intimidate."" However, the notion that an independent Scotland would not have access to the established British pound sterling as the national currency would likely cause some referendum voters to think critically about the costs of sovereignty.  Already, they would have to consider the ambitious independence timetable of holding a referendum in September 2014, followed by independent nation state status in the first part of 2016.For its part, the SNP has said that its aggressive plan for independence  was in keeping with other shifts in the status of nation states in Europe, such as the splitting of the former Czechoslolvakia into  the Czech Republic and Slovakia.  But representatives of the  government of the United Kingdom were not quite so sanguine about the prospects of a sovereignty and independence schedule of less than two years.  Alistair Darling, the former press secretary of British Prime Minister Tony Blair and current leader of an anti-independence group, Better Together, was on the record dismissing the timetable as unrealistic.  He said, ""Even with the best will in the world, even if there is no disagreement over some of the major issues like what happens to our currency, how we divide up our pension system, and how we split the national debt, achieving this timetable is a tall order.""Indeed,  in less than 20 months after ratification (assuming there was a ""yes"" vote), Scotland  would have to be removed from the United Kingdom, and then establish a separate Treasury,  and apply for accession to the European Union. other issues would be the division of military interests, such as the United Kingdom's submarine fleet, which was based in Scotland, as well as the  United Kingdom's claim to a permanent seat at the United Nations Security Council.Regardless, the Sept. 18, 2014, date  set for a referendum on Scotland's independence from the United Kingdom was moving forward.  The date was set to coincide with a re-enactment of the 700th anniversary of the Battle of Bannockburn, a historic Scottish victory over the English.  In accordance with the  Scottish Independence Referendum Bill,  the referendum would pose the following question to voters for a ""yes"" or ""no"" response: ""Should Scotland be an independent country?""On the issue of the Scottish independence, Salmond said, ""It will be a historic day and one on which this ancient nation decides its place in the world.""  For his part, United Kingdom  Prime Minister David Cameron has said that Scotland would be better off if it remained under the collective flag of  the United Kingdom.  He warned that fragmentation of the United Kingdom would result in diminished economic strength, national security, and international influence.  Perhaps not surprisingly,  Scottish First Minister Salmond held a different view, believing that Scotland would be better positioned as a sovereign nation state.  To this end, Salmond argued: ""Only the powers of an independent parliament with control of the economy, of international representation and of security will allow us to make the most of our huge national potential.""The road to the Independence Referendum --At the start of March 2014, with the independence referendum only months away,  Salmond -- the Scottish leader -- called on British citizens to support the independence campaign.  He argued thatan independent Scotland would act as a countervailing power against London-centered domination.  He said, ""After Scottish independence, the growth of a strong economic power in the north of these islands would benefit everyone -- our closest neighbors in the north of England more than anyone.""  He continued, ""There would be a 'Northern Light' to redress the influence of the 'dark star' -- rebalancing the economic center of gravity of these islands.""But British Prime Minister David Cameron was carrying out his own pro-unity campaign (colloquially referred to as ""love bombing"")  in which he called on British citizens in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland to remind their Scottish friends and relatives that they were all better off together.Former United Kingdom Prime Minister Gordon Brown -- a Scot --  entered the debate in mid-March 2014 to join the non-partisan call for national unity, and to advocate for more increased autonomy for Scotland rather than independence.  Speaking from Glasgow, Brown said, ""The majority of Scottish people do not want separation but equally they do want change.""  He continued, ""I want to move us from the old highly centralized, uniform Britain dominated by out-of-date ideas of an undivided Westminster sovereignty to a new diverse power-sharing, risk-sharing, resource-sharing U.K. which is best defined ... as a modern, constitutional partnership of nations.""Polling data has -- for some time --  indicated that most people in Scotland actually do not favor independence from the United Kingdom, preferring to maintain the current union.  In March 2014, an Ipsos-Mori poll showed only 32 percent support for  Scottish independence, with 57 percent against it, and 11 percent undecided  Nevertheless, the pro-independence forces planned for a robust campaign and with the intent of persuading people of their sovereignty argument.In August 2014, with only a month to go before the referendum on Scottish independence was set to take place in September 2014, the advantage appeared to reside with the pro-unity side. This advantage was displayed during an initial debate between Alex Salmond, the head of the pro-independence Scottish National Party (SNP) and the  leader of the campaign for Scottish, and Alistair Darling, the leader of the campaign to retain Scotland as part of the United Kingdom.The energetic debate, which was broadcast in the media, ended with the conclusion that Salmond -- usually a powerful speaker -- had not effectively made the case for independence, particularly as regards the economic path for a sovereign Scotland.  On the other hand, Darling -- not known for his command of rhetoric -- offered a solid performance by challenging Salmond's vision for post-independence currency and revenue.  Drawing attention to the fact that an independent Scotland would not be allowed to use the British pound sterling,  Darling posed the following question to Salmond: ""What is plan B?""  Salmond was unable to substantially address this challenge, and instead asserted, ""I am in favor of keeping the pound sterling,"" while claiming that that the pound belonged to both England and Scotland.  But the fact of the matter was that the United Kingdom had already rejected the notion of a currency union that would allow Scotland to use the British pound sterling as its legal tender.  To this end, Darling noted that the use by an independent Scotland of the British pound would be like another country in the Americas using the United States or Canadian dollar.  He declared: ""That's using sterling like Panama or Ecuador uses the dollar.""It should be noted that a second debate was held in the last week of August 2014.  During that engagement, Salmond enjoyed a much better performance with most observers concluding that he had ""won"" the argument against Darling -- at least for the night. It was to be seen if this strong rhetorical presentation  would persuade voters to move to the pro-independence  position ahead of the actual referendum.Note that as August 2014 was coming to a close, polling data showed little movement in the views of voters.  While there was some mild improvement towards the pro-independence side of the equation, the pro-unity faction continued to command the advatage.  A so-called ""poll of polls"" in mid-August 2014 showed that support for Scottish independence  stood at 43 percent  while support for United Kingdom's unity stood at 57 percent.At the start of September 2014, the landscape shifted significantly.  A YouGov survey for the Sunday Times showed that, for the first time, the pro-independence side had taken the lead.  The ""Yes"" to Independence campaign now was yielding 51 percent of support while the unionists had close to 49 percent.  Clearly, for advocates of Scottish independence, the movement was peaking at precisely the right time -- just two weeks ahead of the referendum.  The shift was attributed to the strong performance of pro-independence orchestrator, Salmond, in the second televised debate.Underlining the reality that the referendum would go down to the wire and that Scots might, in fact, opt for independence, a INS poll showed the ""no"" vote dropping to 39 percent with the ""yes"" vote within the statistical margin of error with 38 percent. Several other polling surveys at the start of September 2014 showed momentum for the ""yes"" vote.Independence for Scotland would involve negotiations over usage of the pound sterling currency -- something the ""Better Together"" unity camp has warned would not end well for a sovereign Scotland, as discussed above.  Also to be determined would be the division of the national debt of the United Kingdom, control over oil in the North Sea, and the fate of the nuclear submarine base located in Scotland. Other likely consequences of an independent Scotland would be the loss of defense and financial sector jobs, along with obstacles to European Union accession.Politically, the consequences of a successful ""yes"" campaign in Scotland would create dire consequences for both of the two major parties in the United Kingdom.  Should Scotland vote to exit the United Kingdom, the humiliation for Prime Minister David Cameron would be great, and would likely include demands that the Conservative leader resign from office.  But the situation would be no rosier for the Labor Party, which would lose key support since the current Scottish members of parliament would be effectively removed from the scene.With such possible  ends at hand -- especially given the sudden burst of support for the independence movement --there were plans afoot from the ""Better Together"" unionist campaign.  At issue was an attractive package that would offer  more powers to Scotland over its taxes, as well as its social and economic affairs.  This so-called ""devolution"" plan was intended to regain support of Scots looking for more autonomy and control, while not entirely interested in exiting the United Kingdom.  It was to be seen if this federal powers package would gain support.Former United Kingdom Prime Minister Gordon Brown called on fellow Labor Party supporters to consider his party's plan for devolution of powers, saying, ""This moves us as close to federalism as we can. Scotland is already a nation. We are proud of our history and culture. Do we want to sever all constitutional links with our friends, our neighbors, our relatives in England, Wales and Northern Ireland?""A week later, on the eve of the referendum, the official devolution package (brokered by former Prime Minister Brown) offered Scotland a guarantee of high levels of public spending as well as self-determination over health care spending.  At the end of the day, even if Scotland were to vote ""no"" to independence, as shown by this package,  the structure of the United Kingdom was destined to change.  That change would involve the devolution of powers away from the central government in London.Meanwhile, the British political establishment was making an impassioned plea for unity.  United Kingdom  Prime Minister David Cameron declared, ""In the end, it is for the Scottish people to decide, but I want them to know that the rest of the United Kingdom -- and I speak as prime minister -- want them to stay.""Prime Minister Cameron subsequently emphasized the significance of a ""yes"" vote to ratify Scotland's independence aspiration.  He warned that saying ""yes"" to independence would be a final stance with no room for reversal, as he declared: ""There's no going back from this. No re-run. If Scotland votes 'yes' the U.K. will split and we will go our separate ways forever. ""The Bank of England issued a stark reminder to Scots that an independent Scotland would not be able to keep the British pound sterling currency.  The bank's governor, Mark Carney, warned that a currency union between an independent Scotland and the remainder of the United Kingdom would be incompatible with the very notion of sovereignty.The fact of the matter was that there would be nothing stopping an independent Scotland from using the British pound sterling as its currency.  However, without a currency and monetary arrangement -- something the Bank of England has said it will not entertain -- an independent Scotland would need a stockpile of pound sterling.  As well, there would be potentially disastrous consequences for Scotland  since the Bank of England would no longer be last lender of resort for Scotland's banking industry. Moreover, Scotland would have no say in monetary policy, which would be dictated by the Bank of England.Meanwhile, in an open letter, 14 former heads of the United Kingdom's Army, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force warned that a ""yes"" vote for independence would be detrimental to the defense of both the United Kingdom and a future independent Scotland.  As stated in the piece, ""The division of the U.K. may or may not be politically or economically sensible, but in military terms we are clear: it will weaken us all.""On the eve of the referendum, a slate of polls showed a close race to the finish, with the ""no"" vote recouping a slight advantage. The closeness of the pre-election polls suggested that there was no known guarantee of the outcome of the referendum. Three pollsters -- ICM, Opinium, and Survation -- showed support for independence at  48 percent while support for retaining the union stood at 52 percent. With a significant share of Scotland's voters (around 10 percent) still undecided, the result could conceivably go either way.Referendum and ResultUltimately, on Sept. 18, 2014, Scottish voters were set to give their answer -- ""yes"" or ""no"" -- to the question,  ""Should Scotland be an independent country?"".Regardless of the outcome, the current structure of the United Kingdom was destined to change. Would that transformation be limited to increased autonomy within the preserved United Kingdom, or, would that transformation see a fully independent Scotland emerge on the global scene?The answer to these questions came democratically on Sept. 18, 2014, with a decisive ""no"" vote to independence and in favor of holding together the union.  The pro-union vote share outperformed the pre-referendum polling data with 55 percent voting ""no"" and in favor of remaining in the United Kingdom, and 45 percent voting ""yes"" and for Scottish independence.Of the 32 councils in Scotland, only four voted ""yes"" in favor of independence, while 28 voted ""no"" and in favor of staying in the United Kingdom. The divided sentiment of the electorate was illustrated by the fact that  Glasgow -- the largest city in Scotland -- was a stronghold for the ""yes"" vote while Edinburgh -- the capital of Scotland -- voted ""no."" That being said, the breakdown of the vote results from the 32 councils in Scotland suggested that the ""no"" vote was stronger in constituencies with better socio-economic conditions than in less comfortable constituencies where the ""yes"" vote saw a better performance.At the end of the day, the Scottish independence referendum on Sept. 18, 2014, was marked by the highest voter turnout rate -- between 85 and 90 percent -- in a national election.  As such, the Scottish independence vote stood as a reminder to the rest of the world of how participatory democracy works in a mature nation state.Alistair Darling, the head of the ""Better Together"" pro-unity campaign declared victory, saying, ""We have chosen unity over division, and positive change rather than needless separation.""Meanwhile, Scottish nationalist leader Alex Salmond conceded defeat but warned that the government in London would have to honor its commitments to extend greater powers to Scotland.  He said, ""There are 1.6 million people who made a choice for independence.  I think the 1.6 million people will speak and speak loud if there is a retreat from the commitments made.""  Salmond also announced that he would resign as leader of the Scottish Nationalist Party, saying: ""For me as leader my time is nearly over but for Scotland the campaign continues and the dream will never die.""  Salmond's  deputy, Nicola Sturgeon, was seen as a likely successor and the favored choice to be the future leader of the Scottish Nationalists.For his part, Prime Minister David Cameron issued a public statement  hailing the referendum result, and noting that the question of Scottish independence had now been settled for a generation.  He said, ""There can be no disputes, no re-runs, we have heard the settled will of the Scottish people.""  Cameron also promised to honor the commitments to convey greater powers of self determination to Scotland, while also addressing nationalist sentiment in Northern Ireland, Wales, and England, as he asserted:  ""Just as Scotland will vote separately in the Scottish parliament on their issues of tax, spending and welfare, so too England, as well as Wales and Northern Ireland should be able to vote on these issues.""Queen Elizabeth issued a statement of national unity, declaring: ""Knowing the people of Scotland as I do, I have no doubt that Scots ... are able to express strongly-held opinions before coming together again in a spirit of mutual respect and support, to work constructively for the future of Scotland and indeed all parts of this country.""While the question of Scottish independence was now settled, there would nonetheless be changes afoot for increased self-determination and autonomy for Scotland under the aegis of the United Kingdom.  The question of how those proposed transformations would go forward remained a matter of debate.Of note was the fact that Prime Minister Cameron's proposal was not being embraced by former Labor Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who lobbied hard for unity. Brown and other Labor leaders were  highly skeptical of Cameron's call for increased autonomy for the other member state of the United Kingdom -- particularly in England, where Labor's influence could be diminished.  Labor Leader, Ed Milliband, made it clear that his party -- which helped to seal the ""no"" vote -- would not sign on to Prime Minister Cameron's plan to use the Scottish devolution measures to give more power to English members of parliament.  Instead, he has called for a national constitutional convention that would be tasked with crafting a plan to move forward.Prime Minister Cameron was also facing headwinds from within his own Conservative party with some members of parliament angry that Scotland should be ""rewarded:"" for its independence aspirations and at the expense of the rest of the United Kingdom, particularly England. It was for this reason that Cameron had introduced the notion of special provisions for all parts of the union.  But, as discussed here, that was a proposition was not being embraced by the Labor Party.At the same time, Cameron's proposal caused grave consternation among Scottish nationalists, with the outgoing leader, Salmond, accusing the prime minister of ""tricking"" Scottish voters with promises of enhanced autonomy and special powers over taxes, social welfare, and spending before the vote, only to subsume those pledges as part of a restructuring plan guaranteed to help his own Tory base with English constituents.  Addressing this complaint, Cameron was forced to respond with a promise that  there would be no linkage between an eventual Scottish self-determination plan and a deal to assuage English conservatives.  His office was compelled to issue a statement confirming that Scotland would receive more autonomy with no ""ifs or buts.""In practical terms, the scale of constitutional changes that would be necessitated to meet Scotland's needs for greater autonomy and self determination would be significant, and thus promised to be a laborious endeavor.Editor's Note on the United Kingdom:Located in Western Europe, between the North Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea, just to the northwest of France, the United Kingdom is made up of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.  Northern Ireland is to be found on the northern one-sixth of the island of Ireland.It should be noted that the terms ""Great Britain"" and ""United Kingdom"" cannot correctly be used in an interchangeable manner.Great Britain refers to the island to the west of France and east of Ireland that consists of three related regions -- England, Scotland, and Wales.  However, Great Britain is not the proper name of any current sovereign nation state, as it excludes Northern Ireland, which is also part of the country called  the United Kingdom.  In fact, the official name of the country is ""United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.""Scotland and England were joined in 1603 when King James VI of Scotland succeeded his cousin, Queen Elizabeth I, to claim the British throne. In 1707, the Act of Union created a new country, Great Britain. Ireland had been conquered by the early 17th century, and the 1801 British Acts of Union established the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1922, 26 counties of Ireland gained independence from London, with the other six counties remaining in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.The Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales, and the Northern Ireland Assembly were established in 1999. The latter was suspended until May 2007 due to wrangling over the peace process, but devolution was fully completed in March 2010.In 2013, a process was started to allow for a referendum for Scottish independence.  That vote was to take place in 2014.The result of that referendum gave  a decisive victory to the pro-union side, effectively squashing the independence thrust at least for a generation in favor of increased Scottish autonomy.  It should be noted that in order for Scotland to become independent, regardless of the result of the internal referendum, the British Parliament would have to dissolve the Acts of Union.At the beginning of the 20th century the British Empire had been the foremost global power, stretching over one-fourth of the earth's surface. But World War I significantly weakened the United Kingdom, and the years following World War II saw the demise of the empire with many colonies gaining independence. Nevertheless, the country remains a major world economic and military power, with considerable political and cultural influence around the world. As the world's first industrialized country, the economy of the United Kingdom is one of the largest in the world as well as one of the strongest in Europe, and is considered to be a leading trading power and financial center.It should also be noted that the United Kingdom has historically played a leading role in developing parliamentary democracy and in advancing literature and science. The country has a long history as a major player in international affairs and fulfills an important role in the European Union, the United Nations and NATO. The United Kingdom is also an active member of the European Union, although it chose to remain outside the Economic and Monetary Union. The government has said a series of economic criteria must be met before the issue can be put to a referendum.Last British combat troops exit AfghanistanIn late October 2014, United States and United Kingdom forces exited their main military bases in Helmand province, effectively turning security over to Afghan forces.  While the complete withdrawal of United States forces would not ensue until 2016, a phased draw-down was certainly taking place and would continue over the course of the next year.  At the same time, this particular exit from Helmand  was significant for the United Kingdom as it marked the withdrawal of the last British combat forces from Afghanistan after being in the Afghan combat zone for more than a decade.  For its part, the Afghan military said that it was prepared to take responsibility for the security of the country, pointing to the fact that increasingly, support from United States and United Kingdom forces had become more psychological than in the battlefield.United Kingdom and United States announce plans for counter-terrorism cooperationDuring a state visit to the United States, United Kingdom Prime Minister David Cameron  joined his American counterpart, President  Barack Obama, in announcing a plan for counter-terrorism cooperation.  Among the measures to be implemented were the establishment of a counter-terrorism  task force and the deployment of more drones aimed at targeting the terror group, Islamic State. In the effort to track terrorists, the two leaders were advocating greater cooperation with technology companies, with an eye on accessing encrypted communications that terrorists may use to plot attacks.The leaders of the two countries emphasized the closeness of the trans-Atlantic partnership, with both men offering fulsome assurances of their personal friendship as well as the strength and depth of the United Kingdom-United States alliance.  Prime Minister Cameron and President Obama made clear that their two countries were committed to sharing information, intelligence, and expertise in the effort to prevent Islamist radicalism and to address ""violent extremism"" in their respective countries.Speaking of the threat posed by Islamist terrorists in the wake of the Paris attacks, Prime Minister Cameron noted that his country, along with the United States,  faced a ""poisonous and fanatical ideology.""  He said: ""We face a poisonous and fanatical ideology that wants to pervert one of the world's major religions, Islam, and create conflict, terror and death. With our allies we will confront it wherever it appears.""  President Obama struck a similar tone, saying that his country would work with the United Kingdom and other allies ""seamlessly to prevent attacks and defeat these terrorist networks.""  Explaining the challenge posed by radicalized extremists who carry out acts of terror, he said ""This is a problem that causes great heartache and tragedy and destruction. But it is one that ultimately we are going to defeat.""2015  parliamentary elections in United KingdomCitizens of United Kingdom make their choice in parliamentary elections; PM David Cameron's Conservatives secure decisive victory while the Labour Party is routed by nationalists in Scotland --Summary:The citizens of the United Kingdom were set to go to polls to vote in parliamentary elections to be held on May 7, 2015. While the major dividing line in the election stood between the Conservative Party (known colloquially as the Tories) and the Labour Party, the traditional political dichotomy was cross-cut by popular support for the nationalist parties -- the right-wing United Kingdom Independent Party (UKIP) and the the left-leaning Scottish National Party (SNP).Going into the election, pre-election polling data suggested that no one party would secure an outright majority, and instead the election was likely to produce yet another ""hung parliament.""  The expected election discussion was to focus on the party receiving the plurality of seats, and thus being positioned  to form a coalition government. Despite their contracting support, the Liberal Democrats -- the junior party in the outgoing Conservative-led government -- insisted they would again play a kingmaker role.  In truth, however, the Scottish Nationalists were hoping that they would gain that kingmaker status even as the major contest would be set against Prime Minister David Cameron's Conservative Tories and Ed Milliband's Labour Party.In reality, however, pre-election polling data turned out not to be predictive of what actually happened on election day. Instead, Prime Minister David Cameron and the Conservative Party secured a decisive election victory and a parliamentary majority. For its part, the Labour Party endured a disappointing performance, as well as a rout in Scotland where the Scottish Nationalists won the lion's share of seats. This result augured the end of Ed Milliband's career at the helm of Labour.  Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats -- the junior partner in the outgoing Tory-led government -- saw a spectacular erosion of support, albeit not complete decimation.  The leader of the Liberal Democrats, Nick Clegg,  quickly made clear that it was time for his exit at the helm of his party.  Finally, while Nicola Sturgeon could celebrate the triumph of the Scottish Nationalists, it was to be seen what role that party would play in the political environs of parliament.In Detail:Parliamentary elections were set to be held in the United Kingdom on May 7, 2015. At issue would be control over the legislative branch of government.  In the United Kingdom, the bicameral parliament consists of the House of Lords and the House of Commons.  The House of Lords has 788 seats; there are approximately 670 life peers, 92 hereditary peers, and 26 clergy; membership is not static.  The House of Commons has 650 seats; members elected by popular vote to serve five-year terms unless the House is dissolved earlier.  Political leadership is based on control over the lower chamber -- the House of Commons -- where the leader of the majority party or coalition is the prime minister and head of government.  As such, in the United Kingdom, election action is concentrated on the House of Commons.Since the last elections, which were held in May 2010, the United Kingdom has been politically led by Prime Minister  David Cameron (of the Conservative Party or ""Tories"") and  Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg (of the Liberal Democrats) in a coalition government.  In those 2010 elections, no one party had control over the House of Commons.  Cameron's center-right Conservatives garnered a plurality of the vote count but not an absolute majority; they entered a coalition government with the third place center-left Liberal Democrats, while second place left-leaning Labour Party moved from being the party in power into the party in opposition.  Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown stepped down as leader of the Labour Party and moved to the position of backbench member of parliament.In 2015, it was to be seen which party would be victorious.  The main parties expected to contest these electons included the center-right Conservative Party (known colloquially as the Tories), led by Prime Minister Cameron; the center-left Liberal Democrats and junior partner in the outgoing coalition, led by Deputy Prime Minister Clegg; the left-leaning Labour Party, led by Ed Milliband, who was aspiring to become the new prime minister;  the right-wing United Kingdom Independent Party (UKIP), led by Nigel Farage; and the left-leaning Scottish National Party, led by Nicola Sturgeon.  Also contesting the election would be a number of other  nationalist parties, such as  the Democratic Unionist Party or DUP (Northern Ireland);  Ulster Unionist Party (Northern Ireland); Sinn Fein (Northern Ireland); Social Democratic and Labor Party or SDLP (Northern Ireland); and Party of Wales, also known as Plaid Cymru.Survey data released in February 2015 ahead of the elections indicated that no one party would likely gain an absolute majority at the polls. The research compiled by by the pollster group, Populus, and the public affairs company, Hanover, suggested that while Labour would lose several seats in Scotland to the Scottish nationalists, it would nonetheless have a better chance of forming a majority leftist or center-left coalition than the Conservative Tories, who would likely have to rely on consolidating their seats with the Liberal Democrats again in order to control parliament.  They might also have to look to the Democratic Unionist Party or DUP in Northern Ireland to hold a majority.  The Conservatives would themselves lose seats to the right-wing  UKIP.However, polling data by Ashcroft in early February 2015 gave Prime Minister Cameron's Conservative Party a three percentage point lead over Milliband's Labour Party -- 34 percent to 31 percent respectively.  In third place was UKIP with 14 percent, followed by the Liberal Democrats with nine percent, and then the Greens with six percent. While this polling result offered a more positive pathway to victory for Prime Minister Cameron, he would still need a far more significant lead to win an outright majority in parliament.  As before, were he to secure a plurality of the vote share but not a majority, he would once again have to form a coalition government.By mid-February 2015, two polls gave contradictory forecasts of the elections to come.  The Guardian/ICM poll gave the Conservatives (Tories)  36 percent -- an increase of  six points from the previous month and the highest level since 2012.  Labour had fallen one point to 32 percent. The Liberal Democrats were at ten percent, UKIP was at nine percent, the Green Party was at seven points.  However,  a Populus poll gave the  Labour Party with lead with  33 percent, with the Conservatives slightly behind with 31 percent.At the start of March 2015, these trends remained roughly in place with the Tories holding a slight lead over Labour, the Liberal Democrats and UKIP in competition for the right to play ""kingmaker"" in the case of a ""hung parliament."" Of note was the consistently significant vote share being carried by the Scottish Nationalists to the detriment of the Labour Party.  It was apparent that in the aftermath of the Scottish Independence referendum, and the slow movement in achieving the promises advocated by the pro-unionists, Scottish voters were going their own way in these polls.Also of note at the start of March 2015 was the fact that a political imbroglio was unfolding. At issue was the fact that the Conservative leader David Cameron would consent to only one 90-minute televised debate ahead of the elections. His rivals from other parties, including Labour leader Ed Miliband, Liberal Democratic leader Nick Clegg, UKIP leader Nigel Farage, Natalie Bennett of the Green Party, Nicola Sturgeon of the Scottish National Party and Leanne Wood of Plaid Cymru, pilloried the Tory leader for refusing to engage in a thorough competition.A spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats noted that it was not right for one party to ""dictate their terms"" regarding the debates. A UKIP spokesperson offered a more painful rebuke, saying, ""After praising what a good thing debates were for democracy as recently as 2014, why is David Cameron now acting chicken and running as far away from them as possible?"" Meanwhile, Douglas Adams of the Labour Party said, ""This is an outrageous attempt from the prime minister to bully the broadcasters into dropping their proposals for a head-to-head debate between David Cameron and Ed Miliband.""Meanwhile, another issue was brewing as regards the splitting of the right-wing vote between the Conservatives (Tories) and UKIP.  At issue was the South Thanet constituency of southern England, which has been  a Conservative stronghold held by the Tories for most of the last 130 years.  In 2015, polling data indicated that  UKIP's leader, Nigel Farage, had a decent chance of winning this seat and grabbing control of a parliamentary seat long-thought to be a safe win for the Tories.  For his part, Farage said if he failed to win the South Thanet seat, he would resign as the leader of UKIP.  As stated by Farage,  ""The consequences of me failing to secure a seat for myself in the Commons would be significant for both myself and the party."" He continued, ""It is frankly just not credible for me to continue to lead the party without a Westminster seat ... If I fail to win South Thanet, it is curtains for me. I will have to step down.""Tory leader Cameron entered the fray with his own pledge.  The prime minister said that if his Conservative Party were to win the forthcoming  parliamentary elections, then  he would not seek a third term in office.  Instead, Cameron said he would serve the full five-year term in government, if his party were to gain victory; however, he would not seek to lead the country beyond that next five-year term.  In the interview with BBC News, Cameron said, ""There definitely comes a time when a fresh pair of eyes and fresh leadership would be good, and the Conservative Party has some great people coming up.""  Cameron's pledge did not resonate positively with the main opposition Labor Party.  David Alexander, the head of Labor's election campaign, said, ""It is typically arrogant of David Cameron to presume a third Tory term in 2020 before the British public have been given the chance to have their say in this election.""Playing to the nationalists and euro-skeptics -- an ultra-conservative voting base that might be vulnerable to transferring their support to UKIP -- Cameron was promising to hold a referendum on European Union membership.  The move was yielding results and boosting Cameron's prospects (as noted below) to hold onto his job as his Tories were now advancing a lead over Labor.  In response, Miliband was warning voters that a win for the Conservatives could herald the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union, with financial and business woes to follow. The fact of the matter, however, was that in late March 2015, the advantage appeared to be with Cameron and the Tories as discussed below.Polling data by ComRes for ITV News and the Daily Mail newspaper in late March 2015 showed Prime Minister Cameron's Conservatives leading Miliband's Labour Party by four percentage points.  The Conservatives were now sporting 36 percent support, with Labour holding onto 32 percent support.  UKIP was at 12 percent; the Liberal Democrats were sitting just short of double digits with nine percent; and the Greens had five percent. It was to be seen if this trend would hold until election day.A televised political debate on April 2, 2015,  produced no clear winner, with post-debate data showing that Prime Minister Cameron, Labour leader Miliband, Scottish Nationalist leader  Nicola Sturgeon and UKIP leader Farage, all scoring well in terms of performance.That debate performance was translating into a similarly close pre-election polling results with a  Guardian/ICM poll showing Miliband slightly ahead of Cameron -- 25 percent to 24 percent -- in terms of which candidate was viewed as the debate winner. A separate YouGov opinion poll surveyed overall voting preferences and showed Cameron's  Conservatives slightly ahead  of Miliband's Labour Party -- 37 percent to 35 percent respectively.  Meanwhile, a poll for the Daily Mirror publication gave the reverse result with Labour slightly ahead of the Conservatives -- 33 percent to 31 percent respectively.By mid-April 2015,  YouGov polling data showed a close race between Labour and the Conservatives.  A series of polls by YouGov showed Labour hovering about 34-35 percent, just slightly ahead of the Conservatives, who had 33 percent. UKIP was in third place with 13 percent, the Liberal Democrats had eight percent and the Greens had five to six percent.Taken together, these results presaged a close election, with no one party likely to gain an outright parliamentary majority, and with many citizens opting for other parties, such as UKIP and the Scottish Nationalists.  That being said, research by Deutsche Bank in mid-April 2015 suggested that while the election would very likely produce no clear winner and thus a ""hung parliament,"" Labour might be better positioned to form a government than the Conservatives.Labour, in pure numbers, would lose significant seats in Scotland to the Scottish Nationalists due to Scottish outrage that few of the pre-independence referendum promises were kept.  But the Scottish Nationalists would nevertheless throw their support behind a Labour-led government, whereas they would shun the Conservatives. While the Liberal Democrats -- the junior partner in Cameron's Conservative-led government -- were actually eroding support; they remained aware that they could play kingmaker in either a Labour-led or a Conservative-led government in the future.  By contrast, the Conservative Party was losing support to UKIP, an unlikely coalition partner, while its current coalition partner, the Liberal Democrats was not likely to see a particularly strong performance, and so could provide only limited (albeit crucial) support in a future Conservative-led government.  Stated differently, even with its outgoing coalition partner, the Liberal Democrats, the road to a coalition would thus be comparatively more difficult for the Conservatives.  As such, the conclusion was that in a close election, Labour would have more options of secondary parties in forming a sustainable coalition government.Labour received a boost in the third week of April 2015 following a final televised debate. Post-debate surveys -- which actually did not include Cameron  -- concluded that Miliband, the Labour Party leader, had won the rhetorical exercise.  However, that success was not necessarily translating into a boost at the polls. Instead, most polls taken during this period actually gave the Conservatives the edge.  The daily YouGov poll gave Labour a one point advantage -- 35 percent -- to the Conservatives with 34 percent, but its assessment in the next few days  showed the Conservatives gaining support. A subsequent poll by YouGov showed the two main parties ties at 34 percent, while another one showed the Conservatives capturing the lead and holding 35 percent with Labour at 34 percent.  A separate poll by Survation showed a similar result with the Conservatives holding 34 percent and Labour was down to 33 percent.As April 2015 came to a close, the daily YouGov poll showed the Tories with a single percent lead of 35 percent to 34 percent ahead of Labour. That one percent advantage was also reflected in an Opinium poll for the Observer newspaper that showed the  Tories with a single point lead of 34 percent to 33 percent ahead of Labour.  But soon thereafter, another daily poll by YouGov showed Labour with the one point lead -- 35 percent -- against the Conservatives, who had 34 percent.  As before, neither party could claim it was on track for an outright majority in parliament.In the final days before the election, the two  parties made their final case for support.  For  Prime Minister David Cameron's Conservative party, the emphasis was on their stewardship of the economy, matched by dire warnings of increased taxation, should the country by led by Milliband and Labour.  In an attempt to curry favor with the euro-skeptics and xenophobes that the Tories were losing to UKIP, Prime Minister Cameron also promised that, should he hold onto power, a referendum would be held to decide whether the United Kingdom should remain in the European Union.The prime minister also mocked a  move by Labour leader Milliband to burnish his leadership credentials by producing campaign promises literally engraved ""in stone"" upon a stone block. To this end, some critics acerbically cast Milliband as the biblical Moses. For his part, Cameron referred to the stone block as a ""tombstone,"" suggesting that Milliband's political ambitions were about to see a death of sorts.  But despite Cameron's glib words, the fact of the matter was that his Tories were unable to advance a notable lead against their main rivals, the Labour Party.It was apparent that Milliband's passionate advocation of the United Kingdom's reverred national health service had strong resonance among a significant portion of the population.  Likewise, Milliband had managed to challenge Cameron's claimed accomplishments on the economy by reminding frustrated voters that all too often, impressive macroeconomic data points did not translate into improved economic conditions in the quotidian lives of people. Labour's effort to cast the Tories' budget, which cut welfare spending, as mean-spirited also bolstered the argument that the Conservatives were not just indifferent to those struggling to make ends meet, but also balancing the budget on the backs of the poor.Indeed, the final pre-election polls continued to show a close race, consistent with the slate of polling data discussed above. For example, both the daily YouGov poll and the Populus opinion poll  showed the two parties tied at 33 percent and 34 percent respectively, while the  Survation opinion poll showed Labour Leading by a single point -- 34 percent -- to the Conservatives with 33 percent; the Ashcroft poll had the Conservatives ahead slightly with 32 percent against Labour with 30 percent.As the voters of the United Kingdom prepared to go to the polls to cast their ballots on May 7, 2015, the political landscape remained static: No one party expected to secure an outright majority, and instead with the election likely to produce yet another ""hung parliament."" Accordingly, all expectations were that the party receiving the plurality of seats would have the chance to form a coalition government. Despite their contracting support, the Liberal Democrats -- the junior party in the outgoing Conservative-led government -- could again play a kingmaker role.  In truth, however, the Liberal Democrats would compete with the UKIP and SNP for that kingmaker status, even as the major contest would be set against Prime Minister David Cameron's Conservative Tories and Ed Milliband's Labour Party.Note on Political Procedure:Typically, the leader of the majority party in the House of Commons is the head of government and is appointed officially by the British monarch. The government (prime minister and cabinet ministers) must maintain the support of a majority of the members of the House of Commons to remain in office.If an election produces a ""hung parliament,"" there is the possibility of another election being called -- presumably with the objective of garnering a more decisive result in the Round 2 election.  However,  the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act of 2011 makes it difficult for early elections to be called.  In the past, a prime minister could simply choose to dissolve parliament and call an election.  Since the advent of the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, there are only two routes to an early election. One option would require the parliament to approve the early election with the support of a two-thirds majority.  It was conceivable that the two-third majority support would only be secured with some sort of alliance across party lines. The second option would involve a motion of no confidence in the government, requiring only a simple majority. If the no confidence motion passed successfully,  a 14-day  timeline would follow in which there would be  attempts to form a new government. The failure of those attempts failed would facilitate an early election.  Given those parameters required for early elections to be called, the more attractive (and practical) option would be to form a sustainable coalition government.Election Results:With most constituencies reporting their results, it was apparent that Prime Minister David Cameron had won a shock victory and would form a Conservative government.In contrast to the predictions of the pre-election polling data, which forecast that no one party would likely secure a majority, the  voters in United Kingdom had a different idea on election day and instead delivered an outright majority to the Conservative Party. With very few constituencies yet to count at the time of writing, the Tories won 330 seats -- just over half of the 650 parliamentary seats in total needed for a simply majority -- and  37 percent of the total vote share.The Labour Party saw a slight decline in the overall popular support from what was expected in the pre-election data and and secured about 31 percent of the vote share.  The Labour Party was on track to secure approximately 232 seats.  It should be noted that Labour's best performance was actually in the London area.The Liberal Democrats appeared to have been punished at the polls, presumably for being the junior party in the outgoing Cameron-led coalition government.  The Liberal Democrats were on track to win less than ten seats and saw about eight percent of the vote share.The Scottish Nationalists enjoyed an overwhelmingly strong performance at the polls, wiping out the Labour Party from this northern stronghold and winning all but a handful of seats there.  Indeed, the SNP garnered 56 seats.Despite all the nationalist and sometimes vituperative rhetoric, there were only limited gains for UKIP to celebrate. Indeed, UKIP was on track to win only one or two seats.Other smaller parties, such as the Greens, as well as the regional parties, such as Plaid Cymru, Sinn Fein, and the Democratic Ulster Union were also  expected to gain representation in parliament.Prime Minister Cameron celebrated the victory of his Conservative Party, which outperformed the polling surveys with impressive results.  On the morning of May 8, 2015, he traveled to Buckingham Palace for an audience with Queen Elizabeth II, the head of state in the United Kingdom, where he was  asked to lead the next government.Meanwhile,  Nick Clegg resigned as the head of the Liberal Democrats, citing the disastrous performance and ""catastrophic losses"" of his party at the 2015 polls.  He noted that it was the worst election experience of Liberal Democrats since the founding of the party.While Labour's defeat was not quite so punishing as the Liberal Democrats' experience at the polls, Ed Milliband nonetheless took responsibility for the losses endured by his party, offered his congratulations to David Cameron,  and tendered his resignation, saying, ""I am truly sorry I did not succeed.""Nigel Farage of UKIP, who did not win his own seat, indicated there would have to be a fresh leadership contest within the party to set the course moving forward.The only party leader other than Cameron celebrating was Nicola Sturgeon of the Scottish Nationalists, who saw a rout in Scotland, winning almost every seat there.  Of course, it was hard to say how the strength of the SNP would translate into political strength since the SNP has made clear it would never work with a Tory government, while the Tories were not in need of assistance in parliament from the Scottish Nationalists to advance their agenda.Nevertheless, the election result for the Scottish Nationalists, juxtaposed against the Scottish independence referendum earlier in the year, showed that the position of Scotland in the Union would  have to change in some form or fashion.  It was to be seen how that change might be envisioned.  For his part, Prime Minister Cameron quickly foreclosed the notion of another independence referendum for Scotland, saying in an interview with the media:  ""We had a referendum. Scotland voted emphatically to stay in the United Kingdom. There isn't going to be another referendum.""Meanwhile, with Cameron making a campaign promise regarding a future referendum on the United Kingdom's participation in the European Union, it was also clear that regional relations were on the agenda.  Of course, given the close friendship between David Cameron and President Barack Obama in the United States, the trans-Atlantic relationship was expected to remain strong.Foreign Relations Note on Syrian CrisisSince early 2011, anti-government protests have spread and escalated across the Arab world; Syria emerged as an addition to the list of countries experiencing unrest in  2011. At first, protesters stopped short of demanding the resignation of President Bashar al-Assad, instead demanding greater political freedom and efforts to end corruption. But over time, as protests continued, and as the Assad regime carried out a hardline crackdown on dissent, tensions escalated between the government and the protesters.  The result was a full-scale civil war.As of 2015, Syria was beset by two sets of intersecting challenges -- the ongoing civil war between the Assad regime and rebel forces on one end, and the horrific dangers posed by the notorious terror group, Islamic State, which had seized wide swaths of territory in Syria and left an appalling death toll.  It was generally understood that the civil war conditions in Syria, to some extent, facilitated the emergence of Islamic State in  that country.  Syrian President Assad's priority to hold onto power, and thus the center of power in Damascus, had allowed a power chasm to flourish in other parts of the country, which Islamic State has been able to exploit.  The result has been a mass exodus of Syrians fleeing the country and seeking refuge in Europe.  The so-called migrant influx in  Europe has raised questions as to how to legally and humanely deal with a burgeoning humanitarian refugee crisis.Following devastating terror attacks by the Islamist terror network that killed hundreds of Russian and French citizens in the autumn of 2015,Russia and France intensified their efforts to go after Islamic State targets in Syria .  At issue was the fact that Islamic State was claiming responsibility for a bomb that exploded on a Russian jet flying from the Egyptian resort of Sharm-el-Sheikh, killing more than 200 Russians on board.Also at issue was the Islamic State claim of responsibility for a spate of appalling terror attacks in the French capital city of Paris, which killed approximately 130 people.  Islamic State made clear that its brutal acts were being carried out because of the international community's engagement in Syria.  Islamic State also promised that attacks were to come in the United States and other Western countries.In response to what could only be understood as acts of war by Islamic State, in November 2015, Russian and French warplanes had wasted no time before stepping up their respective air campaigns in Syria,  targeting Islamic State targets in the terror group's stronghold of Raqqa in a sustained manner.France also deployed its air craft carrier, the Charles de Gaulle, to the Middle Eastern region for the purpose of supporting the effort against Islamic State.  Of note was the fact that France was not limiting its air strike campaign from the Charles de Gaulle only to Islamic State targets in Syria, such as the terror group stronghold of Raqqa; indeed, France soon expanded its scope to hit Islamic State targets in Ramadi and Mosul in Iraq.While the United Kingdom was not, at the time, engaged in the Syrian crisis, the British government gave France the use of its air base in Cyprus from which it could strike Islamist terror groups in the region.United Kingdom Prime Minister David Cameron said that his country would provide  air-to-air refueling services and that he would recommend that the  British parliament vote in favor of the his country joining the United States-led air campaign to strike Islamic State targets.To that end, a vote in the United Kingdom's House of Commons on Dec. 3, 2015 ended with overwhelming support for that country to enter the multilateral air campaign against Islamic State in Syria.  Following more than 10 hours of passionate debate in the British legislative chamber, 397 members of parliament voted in favor of the measure while 223 members of parliament voted against it.  The vote tally was bipartisan with 66 members of parliament from the Labour Party siding with Prime Minister Cameron's Conservatives.Prime Minister Cameron hailed the vote outcome, saying that the House of Commons had  ""taken the right decision to keep the country safe.""  British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said the vote was a move in the right direction as he declared,  ""Military strikes alone won't help Syria, won't keep us safe from Daesh. But this multi-strand approach will.""  Of course, the vote outcome generated outrage fromboth inside and outside parliament.  Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, insisted that the United Kingdom's engagement in Syria would only make the country less safe.  Outside the parliamentary buildings, anti-war protesters from various groups including the  ""Stop the War"" Coalition gathered to oppose the move.

Special Entry on ""Brexit""  and Political After-effects                             

SummaryIn July 2016, in the aftermath of a referendum on the United Kingdom's engagement in the European Union, the political landscape was marked by tectonic political shifts.  Notably, following the decision by the people of the United Kingdom to ratify its withdrawal from the European Union, known as ""Brexit,"" there was also a concomitant transformation at the political level.  Of note was the turmoil within the opposition Labour Party over leader, Jeremy Corbyn,  and more significantly, the decision by Prime  Minister David Cameron to step down. Suffering a catastrophic loss of political capital over the Brexit vote, which did not go his way, he noted that the time was right for new leadership. To that end, he was succeeded on July 13, 2016, by Theresa May as the new Conservative leader and prime minister.In DetailA highly anticipated referendum was set to take place on June 23, 2016, on the future of the United Kingdom's participation in the European Union (EU).  The choices before the people of the United Kingdom (UK) was either to opt out of the EU with a ""leave"" vote, or, to ""remain"" in the EU.The so-called ""Brexit"" vote promised to be a close contest with anti-immigrant sentiment and a Syrian refugee crisis fueling intensified support for nativism, and thus boosting the ""leave"" vote.  Indeed, at the start of June 2016, polls showed that it could go either way, with  a small but significant advantage for those opting out of the EU.The UK's exit from the EU, from which it was a part since 1973, was being viewed through the lens of trepidation, with far reaching consequences of the political and economic variety at hand.The chance of a Brexit was contributing consternation to the business front, with fears arising about the devaluation of the UK's pound sterling currency,  and concerns emerging about the effects on the value of British government bond yields.  Other anxieties revolved around the country's  trade deals -- all of which would have to be renegotiated, as well as the country's investment prospects.  Indeed, the Bank of England  entered the fray to warn voters in the UK that  there would be dire consequences and significant financial disruption to come from a Brexit -- indeed, it would by a deleterious move on the economic front not only in the UK but internationally.These warnings appeared to be falling on significant deaf ears, with immigration-based anxieties and arguments of national sovereignty trumping the reality of catastrophic economic consequences.The dynamics shifted in mid-June 2016 when a  British member of parliament was assassinated by an ultra-right anti-immigration activist.  The death of Jo Cox, a  member of parliament from the Labour Party,  who was known for her advocacy of Syrian refugees and for her advocacy of the ""remain"" campaign, was stabbed and shot to death in West Yorkshire by an assailant screaming ""Britain First.""The assailant was later identified as Thomas Mair and was reported to have connection to far-right and extremist hate groups, along with a record of psychiatric problems.UK Prime Minister David Cameron  expressed horror of Cox's assassination, saying the country was ""rightly shocked.""  He also praised Cox's legacy of community and tolerance, as well as her reputation for compassion for those in need.  Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, cast Cox's murder as ""extreme political violence"" and ""an attack on democracy.""  Members of parliament from the major parties joined in mourning for their late colleague with multi-partisan sobriety  over not just the loss of life -- but the loss of someone who whose  generous character embodied the most respected national values.Overall, there was some restraint from expressly linking the death of Cox to the Brexit referendum.  But there was nonetheless a sense that the ideological struggle between inclusion and xenophobia very likely fueled the tragic scenario.  There was also a feeling of shock that gripped not only the UK but the entirety of Europe where such assassinations have been a rarity for decades.By the last week of June 2016, with the Brexit vote only days away, the climate in the UK had shifted somewhat.  It remained unclear if the shocking death of Cox had been a factor in the change in dynamics, although it was clear that the country was weary from the bitter and divisive debate that had gone on, and a  national trauma had swept the nation with Cox's murder.Regardless of whether this played a role or not was unknown, but now the ""remain"" camp had the advantage in deciding whether or not the UK would stay in the EU.Note:  On July 23, 2016, after British voters cast their votes in the Brexit referendum and their choices were tallied, it was clear that people had chosen to leave the European Union.  The final vote was 52-48 in favor of ""leave"" over ""remain.""With his political capital expended, and now with his legacy  now tainted with the distinction of being the prime minister under whose stewardship the United Kingdom left the European Union, David Cameron resigned as the head of government.  Cameron said he would stay on as prime minister for three months and would step down ahead of the Conservative party's conference.  In a national address, he said, ""I love this country and feel honored to have served it. Will of British people must be respected.""He continued,  ""The British people have spoken....This was not a decision taken lightly. There can be no doubt about the result.""  He urged new leadership, saying, ""I will reassure the markets that British economy is strong. This will require strong leadership. I've been proud to be prime minister for six years.""It should be noted that the news of Brexit immediately spurred a financial meltdown in the global markets with observers noting that in  the Bank of England was poised to play a crucially important stabilizing role.In the days after the Brexit referendum and Prime Minister Cameron's announcement that he would be resigning, there was a meeting of the European Parliament in the Belgian capital of Brussels.  On the agenda was the impending withdrawal of the UK from the EU.Of note was the fact that some EU leaders were making it known that the UK would not be allowed to ""cherry pick"" aspects of the regional bloc to retain for its own benefit.  As well, German Chancellor Angela Merkel,  said that the bloc would ""respect the result"" of the  vote, but that the UK needed to flesh out its exit strategy as quickly as possible.European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker echoed this sentiment, saying that the UK did not have ""months to meditate"" on  its exit schedule and strategy.To that end, the EU argued that the UL had to  formally invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty to trigger the withdrawal talks.  However, outgoing UK Prime Minister  Cameron said Article 50 should  only be invoked by his successor, who would have the duty of guiding the country through that process.Of course, that successor would not likely be chosen until the autumn of 2016.Meanwhile, there were reverberations on the domestic political landscape in the UK from the Brexit vote. In  particular, the vote appeared to have spurred intra-party turbulence and turmoil within the ruling Conservative Party and the official opposition party, Labour, with leadership struggles anticipated to ensue.As discussed above, Prime Minister Cameron had announced his resignation, thus triggering a leadership fight among the Tories (Conservatives) .  One of the first aspirants for Tory leadership was Liam Fox, the former Defense Secretary and a  well-known ""Leave"" campaign advocate.  Other contenders included  Work and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb  and Home Secretary Theresa May.  But it was former London Mayor Boris Johnson -- a prominent ""Leave"" advocate -- was believed to have the edge thanks to the support of 100  members of parliament.However, Johnson shocked the country by eventually stating that he did not intend to run for the leadership post, this generating criticism for his role in sending the country into chaos and bailing before the hard work needed to be done.With the Labour Party, the leader -- Jeremy Corbyn -- was being pilloried with many of his own party in revolt against him.  At issue was the perception that he had not doing enough to prevent the ""Leave"" campaign from  winning.  In fact, on June 29, 2016, Corbyn lost a confidence vote within the party, while a large swath of his shadow cabinet resigned.  Although Corbyn vowed that he would not be pushed out, the fact of the matter was that he has limited power and influence at his disposal at the close of June 2016.With both the Tories and Labour in the midst of these respective power struggles, Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron,  said in an interview with BBC News ""The last thing we need"" was for the country's  two major parties confronting  leadership crises.  That being said, Farron seemed willing to leverage the situation to the benefit of the Liberal Democrats as he declared his party to be  ""the gathering place for progressives.""  Farron called for a political  realignment, warning that without it, ""We will be left with a Tory government forever.""By mid-2016, the post-Brexit political drama was unfolding.  Within the Labour Party, political plots were being hatched to oust party leader Jeremy Corbyn, who lost a confidence vote but remained in place.  Labour member of parliament, Angela Eagle, soon indicated that she would be willing to challenge Corbyn for the party's leadership.By mid-July 2016,  Eagle had lodged her official bid to take Labour's leadership reins.  In a speech making her announcement, she said, ""Today I am announcing my decision to stand for the leadership of the Labour Party.""She continued, ""Jeremy Corbyn is unable to provide the leadership that this party needs – I believe I can. I am not a Blairite, I am not a Brownite and I am not a Corbynista, I am my own woman.""Fallout was also occurring within the nativist UK  Independence Party where ""Leave"" champion, Farage, announced his resignation as the party's leader.As one of the  UK's most passionate advocates for leaving the EU, Farage's announcement was met with shock.  Farage defended his move saying that he had achieved his goal -- that of exiting the EU.  He said, ""I have never been, and I have never wanted to be, a career politician. My aim in being in politics was to get Britain out of the European Union.""  He added, ""During the referendum campaign, I said 'I want my country back.' What I'm saying today, is, 'I want my life back,' and it begins right now."" The truth of the matter was that his departure left a gap to be filled in the ""Leave"" camp.For the Tories, party stalwart,  Theresa May, and an advocate of the ""Remain"" campaign was regarded as a frontrunner to succeed Cameron now that Johnson telegraphed that he did not want the job of leading the party or the country on its path out of the EU.  Following a leadership race in the first part of July 2016 involving  Andrea, a junior energy minister, Michael Gove, another junior secretary, and  former defense minister, Liam Fox, it was May who emerged victorious after successive waves of internal party votes.By  July 13, 2016, David Cameron formally stepped down as prime minister, and after a meeting with Queen Elizabeth II, the UK's head of state, May became the new head of government and the second female to hold that post since Margaret Thatcher.In her first address after becoming prime minister, May stood outside  10 Downing Street and declared that her goal was said to ""build a better Britain."" In an appeal to the British people, she said,  ""The government I lead will be driven, not by the interests of the privileged few, but by yours. We will do everything we can to give you more control over your lives.  When we take the big calls, we'll think not of the powerful, but you.""In her initial round of cabinet appointments, May retained  Philip Hammond -- the foreign secretary under Cameron -- but with the position of  chancellor.  Meanwhile, she shocked the public by selecting  Boris Johnson  -- not known for his international statesmanship  and notorious for his Brexit advocacy -- as the new foreign secretary.  Another appointment of note was that of  David Davis, a Euroskeptic,  who was selected to lead negotiations on exiting the European Union.Meanwhile, there were also effects of the Brexit vote on the status of Scotland, with some analysts suggesting that perhaps there might be a renewed  push for independence.  However, a post-Brexit poll indicated there was no appetite for another independence referendum, despite the fact that Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon made a declaration about  another referendum being ""highly likely.""

Former UK PM Cameron announces resignation as MP; UK readies for Brexit

In September 2016, former United Kingdom Prime Minister Cameron announced that he was resigning his post as a Member of Parliament.

Going back to mid-2016, in the aftermath of the ""Brexit"" vote that heralded the exit of the United Kingdom (UK) from the European Union, Cameron said that he would be stepping down as prime minister. With his political capital expended, and with his legacy tainted with the distinction of being the prime minister under whose stewardship the United Kingdom left the European Union, Cameron resigned as the head of government.

Cameron said he would stay on as prime minister for three months and would step down ahead of the Conservative party's conference.  In a national address, he said, ""I love this country and feel honored to have served it. Will of British people must be respected.""   He continued,  ""The British people have spoken....This was not a decision taken lightly. There can be no doubt about the result.""  He urged new leadership, saying, ""I will reassure the markets that British economy is strong. This will require strong leadership. I've been proud to be prime minister for six years.""

By  July 13, 2016, David Cameron formally stepped down as prime minister, and after a meeting with Queen Elizabeth II, the UK's head of state, May became the new head of government and the second female to hold that post since Margaret Thatcher.

In September 2016, Cameron further announced that he would be resigning from his position as an elected Member of Parliament. Cameron said that he would step down from his role as the elected representative of his Oxfordshire constituency, and allow someone else to take on that role.  He explained that his presence as a  ""back bencher"" in parliament was something of a distraction.  A by-election would be called to fill his seat.

In October 2016, UK Prime Minister Therea May announced that her country would trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty and begin the formal process of her country withdrawing from the European Union. May also foreclosed the notion of an early general election, noting that such a course would only augur instability in the UK.  Instead, ay said that she would advance the repeal the 1972 European Communities Act which took the United Kingdom into the European Common Market, now knowns as the European Union.  She said in an interview with the media, ""We will introduce, in the next Queen's speech, a Great Repeal Bill that will remove the European Communities Act from the statute book.""  The act would become effective upon the formal exit of the UK from the European Union.

UK formally commences Brexit process of withdrawing from the European Union

On March 29, 2017, British  Prime Minister Theresa May formally began the process known colloquially as ""Brexit' of withdrawing the United Kingdom from the United Kingdom.

In keeping with Article 50 of the European Union's Lisbon Treaty, Prime Minister May notified European Union Council President Donald Tusk via a hand-delivered letter that her country would exit the European bloc after decades of participation dating back to 1973.

In a speech to parliament, she declared, ""The United Kingdom is leaving the European Union."" She added, ""This is an historic moment from which there can be no turning back.""

A difficult process lasting up to two years was in the offing whereby the United Kingdom would seek to negotiate the terms of its exit from the European Union. Those negotiations would largely center on the United Kingdom's relations with the European Union with regard to trade and security. 

Note that  Brexit set to be finalized in May 2019. 

Terror attack at Ariana Grande concert in Manchester leaves more than 20 dead

On May 22, 2017, a terror attack after a concert for pop singer Ariana Grande  in Manchester in the United Kingdom left more than 20 people dead and approximately 50 others injured.  Among the dead were children, teenagers, and young people attracted to Grande's music.

The  blast occurred just after Grande left the stage at Manchester's largest indoor arena. The pop star expressed her shock and grief via the social media outlet, Twitter, saying, ""Broken. From the bottom of my heart, I am so so sorry. I don't have words."" 

Authorities soon announced that a suicide bombing caused the bloodshed.  The assailant was identified as  22-year-old Salman Abedi -- a United Kingdom-born son of Libyan refugees.  The terror group,  Islamic State, soon claimed responsibility for the bombing, which was deemed the worst terrorist attack in the United Kingdom since the deaths of 56 people in the July 7, 2005 London bombings.

Given the horror of the 2017 attack,  the Conservatives, Labour, Scottish National Party and Liberal Democrats temporarily suspended campaigning for the general election. Meanwhile, British Prime Minister Theresa May condemned the attack, convened an  emergency meeting, and raised the terror alert level nationally to ""severe.""

Terror attack on London Bridge; Islamic States says its fighters responsible

On June 3, 2017, the British capital city was struck by a terrorist attack when Islamist extremist assailants in a white van rammed their vehicle into people on London Bridge.  After that initial attack, three male assailants wearing fake suicide vests exited the van and attacked the crowd using knives while screaming, ""This is for Allah.""  They then ran towards Borough Market where they continued their rage of terror, attempting to stab random people at restaurants and bars in the area.

Police arrived on the scene, opened fire, and ultimately killed the attackers in short order.  However, by that point, at least seven people in total had died and approximately 50 others had been injured -- about half of them being in critical condition.

It should be noted that the notorious terror group, Islamic State, soon claimed responsibility, saying its ""fighters"" carried out the attack.  To that end, the killers were identified as Pakistan-born Khuram Butt, Rachid Redouane of Barking in the United Kingdom, and  Youssef Zaghba, a Moroccan-Italian man. 

United Kingdom Prime Minister Theresa May convened an emergency meeting in the Cabinet Office Briefing Room A, where crisis response discussions are typically held.  Prime Minister May decried the ""evil"" ideology of Islamist terrorists who carried out the bloodshed.  She warned of counter-terrorism measures  to come, saying that her country ""cannot and must not pretend that things can continue as they are.""  Of particular note was her call for regulation of the Internet where Islamist extremists have been radicalized. 

In the aftermath of the attack, a global political imbroglio had been sparked when United States President Donald Trump accused London Mayor Sadiq Khan of offering ""pathetic excuses"" when Khan assured  Londoners that there was no reason for people to be alarmed.  In fact, the London mayor was assuring the people that they should not be alarmed by the increased police presence.  However, Trump used the truncated quote to further his oft-repeated claim that politicians are often too politically correct regarding terror. Trump appeared to suggest that the London mayor -- a Muslim --  was downplaying the horror of the act of terrorism, even though there was a misrepresentation of Khan's actual words.

For his part, Khan's spokesperson initially dismissed Trump's accusations saying that the mayor ""has more important things to do than respond to Donald Trump's ill-informed tweet that deliberately takes out of context."" Later, in an interview with  BBC News, Khan said: ""We've got to recognize that some people want to divide our communities, some people thrive on fueling division. That's not me, that's not the London I know, and we aren't going to allow anybody, whether it's Donald Trump or anybody else to divide our community.""

The issue was becoming a political one with the leader of the Liberal Democrats, Tim Farron, saying: ""This is a man insulting our national values at a time of introspection and mourning.""  Meanwhile, other politicians were urging that the invitation to Trump for a state visit be revoked. 

Primer on 2017 parliamentary elections in United Kingdom

The citizens of the United Kingdom were set to go to polls to vote in parliamentary elections to be held on June 8, 2017 -- two years ahead of schedule. At issue for Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May was the desire to seek a governing mandate as she guided the country through the process of exiting the European union, known colloquially as ""brexit.""

While the major dividing line in the election stood between the Conservative Party (known as the Tories) and the Labour Party, the traditional political dichotomy was cross-cut by popular support for the nationalist parties -- the right-wing United Kingdom Independent Party (UKIP), the left-leaning Scottish National Party (SNP), and to a lesser degree, by the center-left Liberal Democrats.

At issue would be the composition of the lower parliamentary chamber in the bicameral legislature - the House of Commons.  With that 650 seat body, members are elected by popular vote to serve five-year terms unless the House is dissolved earlier.

In the previous elections, the Conservatives (Tories) won the most seats.

Going into the 2017 contest, polling data gave the Tories a wide lead over Labour.  The main problem for the Labour Party appeared to be intra-party fighting  over its leader Jeremy Corbyn.  Labour was also finding that it was on track to be obliterated in its former stronghold of Scotland, and quite possibly in Wales as well.  Conservative Prime Minister May would also be helped by voters who had been inclined towards the nationalist UKIP party, which was strongly in favor of Brexit, but who were now turning to the Tories.

In the week ahead of the election, however, with Labour fighting back with a series of well produced advertising, an inspired manifesto, and a rousing debate performance by Corbyn, some of the polls tightened significantly. That tightening of the polls was also partially due to weakening support for the Tories following a harsh policy manifesto.  That manifesto included a widely pilloried plan to make the elderly pay more for their care and was unfavorably blasted as a  ""dementia tax."" 

As such, in the days ahead of election day, some polls indicated that Labour was trailing the Tories only slightly -- and within the margin of error.  Still others, though, suggested that the Conservatives would win.  It was to be seen if Labour could pull off a shock surge, or, if a terrorist attack in London on London Bridge would be the decisive factor in returning the Tories to power. 

Once the votes were counted, it appeared that the polls showing a close race were predictive as the United Kingdom was headed for a ""hung parliament."" Indeed, while the Tories won the most seats -- 318, they remained short of an absolute majority in the 650 seat parliament.  The Labour Party appeared to have put forth a valiant effort, winning several marginal seats, even winning seats in Wales that were forecast to be lost, and ultimately denying Prime Minister May the mandate she was seeking.  Indeed, the Labour Party, under the leadership of leftist Corbyn, had consolidated its vote share and won  261 seats. 

For her part, as she delivered a subdued speech from her Maidenhead constituency, Prime Minister May  telegraphed that she would not be stepping down, despite the humiliating performance of her party after leading by double digits in the polls.  She made no mention of the fact that her party had squandered the opportunity to secure a landslide victory.  Instead, May was insistent that she hold onto power and be the person who would manage the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union.

The following day,  Prime Minister May expressed regret for the  loss of Conservative seats, saying, ""I'm sorry for all those candidates and hard working party workers who weren't successful.""  She added, ""As I reflect on the results I will reflect on what we need to do in the future to take the party forward."" 

May also confirmed that she would stay on as prime minister at the helm of a minority government, and she would seek support from the  Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) from Northern Ireland to hold onto power.  While the DUP would not be part of a formal coalition with the Tories, it would nonetheless offer operational support for the Queen's Speech and to pass a budget (effectively, a confidence vote).

Speaking of this arrangement, May said, ""Our two parties have enjoyed a strong relationship over many years and this gives me the confidence to believe that we will be able to work together in the interests of the whole United Kingdom.""  It should be noted that DUP leader Arlene Foster offered a less than enthusiastic statement on the proposed alliance, saying: ""The prime minister has spoken with me this morning and we will enter discussions with the Conservatives to explore how it may be possible to bring stability to our nation at this time of great challenge.""

Nevertheless, Prime Minister May went to Buckingham Palace to ask Queen Elizabeth for permission to form a government -- albeit of the fragile variety.  She also made clear that Brexit negotiations would commence on June 19, 2017, as scheduled. 

Meanwhile, Labour leader Corbyn, who was enjoying political vindication as a result of his party's surprisingly strong performance, made  May should step down.  He also indicated that he was prepared to form a minority government.  He said, ""The mandate she's got is lost Conservative seats, lost votes, lost support and lost confidence."" Corbyn added,  ""I would have thought that's enough to go, actually, and make way for a government that will be truly representative of all of the people of this country.""

Corbyn and the Labour Party would be looking towards the Queen's Speech, which outlines the governing agenda, and the ensuing vote after as a sign of whether May could continue as head of government.  Should the vote at the end of debate after the Queen's Speech go favorably by winning a majority of support in parliament, May could then conceivably pursue passing a budget, which would also be a confidence measure of sorts.  However, if May were to be foiled after the debate on the Queen's Speech, then Labour could, quite possibly, be given a chance to form a government.

Hurricanes devastate the Caribbean Early September 2017 was marked by the wrath of monster Hurricane Irma, which decimated several islands of the Leeward Caribbean before raging across the state of Florida in the United States.  Irma had the dubious distinction of being the most powerful Atlantic storm in a decade. As a Category 5 hurricane, Irma slammed into the island of Barbuda - part of the two-island state of Antigua-Barbuda -- with maximum sustained  winds of 185 miles per hour.  But the massive storm's wide expanse of external bands hit neighboring islands such as St. Martin/St. Maarten and St Barthelemy in the Netherlands and French Antilles, Anguilla in the British Virgin Islands, Turks and Caicos Islands, and the United States territories of the Virgin Islands andPuerto Rico with destructive force.  The storm's path continued on across the northern coasts of Cuba, across portions of the Bahamas, and then sweeping over the Florida Keys  with maximum sustained winds of 130 miles per hour, before covering the rest of the state with dangerous floods and winds.  In the Caribbean, dozens of people were killed but no place suffered worse destruction than Barbuda.  According to Prime Minister Gaston Browne of Antigua and Barbuda said Irma had wreaked ""absolute devastation"" on Barbuda, which was now ""barely habitable"" with 95 percent of the island's infrastructure  completely destroyed.  Up to 90 percent of St. Martin's infrastructure had also been utterly decimated, essentially destroying the French/Dutch territory's tourism industry.  Cuba's north coast, which was home to much of its burgeoning tourism industry,  had now suffered a massive setback in the already-struggling Communist country. Particularly hard-hitHavana, Matanzas, Camagüey and Ciego de Ávila. Ten people were confirmed to have been killed in Cuba alone with authorities noting they had not evacuated to shelters, as instructed to do so.Across the Leeward Caribbean, island nations and territories were being faced with dozens of deaths widespread damage and destruction to infrastructure, as well as a  humanitarian crisis.  Prime Minister Theresa May of the United  Kingdom pledged 32 million in British pounds for recovery assistance in the Caribbean.  The Dutch monarch King Willem-Alexander,  visited Netherlands Antilles affected by Irma, including the Dutch side of St Maarten to show solidarity with the people. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte promised an intensified security presence in affected Dutch territories to ensure order, and noted that security forces had been authorized to function with a ""firm hand.""  French President Emmanuel Macron was criticized for the lateness of his response to St. Martin and St. Barthelemy, but was also expected to make his way to the region to survey the damage and offer assistance for French Caribbean territories' recovery and rebuilding efforts.Independent Caribbean island nations such as Cuba and Antigua-Barbuda would have a more difficult time on their limited resources to recover from Irma's wrath.  In Barbuda more than 1,300 Barbadians were in shelters in Antigua with no suggestion of when they might return home. Assistance was coming from regional neighbors such as Jamaica, St Lucia, and Trinidad and promised assistance while a team from the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency (CDEMA) was  on the ground in Barbuda carrying out an assessment.  A Go Fund Me fund had been established to try to rescue animals left to roam free in Barbuda in the aftermath of the storm.Later in September 2017, the islands of the  Caribbean were bracing for yet another strike by Mother Nature -- this time by Hurricane Maria. The Category five hurricane was forecast to hit the  Leeward Islands in the Caribbean on Sept. 18, 2017.  Hurricane warnings were issued for the islands of Dominica, St. Lucia. St. Kitts-Nevis, the  French overseas territories of  Guadeloupe and Martinique, the United Kingdom overseas territories of Montserrat and the British Virgin Islands, as well as the United States Virgin islands.  Hurricane watches were issues for the French territories of St Martin  (also partially under Dutch jurisdiction) and St Barts, as well as the United States territory of Puerto Rico.  The islands of Saba, St Eustatius and Anguilla were also under hurricane watches.  Of concern was the fact that some of these islands were still suffering the effects of  Irma, and were about to be struck again.  Note that on Sept, 19, 2017, it was reported that Hurricane Maria had almost completely destroyed the Caribbean island nation of Dominica.  The tiny island of less than 80,000 people was viciously struck with maximum sustained winds of nearly 160 miles per hour, which according to Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit, had decimated most of the country's infrastructure.  His own home suffered catastrophic failure - as was the case for most Dominicans. Via the social media outlet Facebook, Skerrit said, ""So far we have lost all what money can buy and replace. My greatest fear for the morning is that we will wake to news of serious physical injury and possible deaths as a result of likely landslides triggered by persistent rains."" He added that the island nation's immediate priority was the rescue of people trapped be the damage of the hurricane, and provision of  medical care to the injured.In the longer run, though, Dominican authorities would have to deal with the reality that the entire country was left in ""war zone"" conditions.Following Maria's destruction of Dominica, the hurricane went onto to strike Puerto Rico -- home to close to 3.5 million Americans -- with brutal force.  In the aftermath of Maria, the island was dealing with destructive and e-coli infested flooding.  That situation was exacerbated when dams were breached. At the same time, large swaths of physical infrastructure were left destroyed.  Meanwhile, the communications networks, including cellular phone and internet service, were largely compromised.

U.K. Prime Minister May and Dutch embassy publicly chastise U.S. President Trump for sharing anti-Muslim videos

In late November 2017, President Donald Trump shared anti-Muslim videos from a known extremist  entity, Britain First, on his favorite communications outlet, Twitter.  British First Britain First seeks to end all immigration, establish a ban on Islam, and deport all persons found to be promoting Islamic ideology. The videos were initially posted by the ultra-right xenophobic deputy leader of British First, Jayda Fransen.  Of note was the fact that Fransen was charged for aggravated harassment and convicted of abusing a Muslim woman. 

Trump, whose campaign platform included a Muslim ban, has been known to tweet controversial content in the past. Indeed, he retweeted material from white nationalist groups before. But the White House defended these retweets of Franzen's anti-Muslim videos, emphasizing that the president was elected for his national security views of immigrants and other groups viewed by his base as a threat to the United States.

White House spokesperson Sarah Sanders said, ""Look, I'm not talking about the nature of the video. The threat is real and that's what the president is talking about is the need for national security, the need for military spending, and those are very real things. There's nothing fake about that.""

The controversy surrounding Franzen's videos surrounded the fact that she convicted of abusing a Muslim woman. 

Members of parliament, as such, reacted with outrage at the notion of a United states president disseminating content from a discredited source such as Fransen, with a clear incendiary purpose.  Some members of parliament lamented Trump's reckless use of Twitter, while others called for the state visit invitation to the U.S. president to be revoked.

The conservative prime minister herself weighed in, issuing a statement in which Theresa May declared: ""It is wrong for the president to have done this."" May's office added: ""Britain First seeks to divide communities through their use of hateful narratives which peddle lies and stoke tensions. They cause anxiety to law-abiding people.""

Even the Dutch government entered the fray as one video posted by Franzen and retweeted by Trump depicted  was titled ""Muslim migrant beats up Dutch boy on crutches!""  The embassy of the Netherlands reacted via Twitter with the following tweet: ""@realDonaldTrump Facts do matter. The perpetrator of the violent act in this video was born and raised in the Netherlands. He received and completed his sentence under Dutch law."" Brexit: United Kingdom and European Union forge framework for ""long divorce"" With Brexit set to be finalized in 2019, intense negotiations went into effect in 2017 to set the conditions for the United Kingdom to disentangle itself from the European Union. Going back to mid-2016, in the aftermath of the ""Brexit"" vote that heralded the exit of the United Kingdom (UK) from the European Union, then-Prime Minister David Cameron said that he would be stepping down as prime minister. With his political capital expended, and with his legacy tainted with the distinction of being the prime minister under whose stewardship the United Kingdom left the European Union, Cameron resigned as the head of government. Cameron said he would stay on as prime minister for three months and would step down ahead of the Conservative party's conference.  In a national address, he said, ""I love this country and feel honored to have served it. Will of British people must be respected.""He continued,  ""The British people have spoken....This was not a decision taken lightly. There can be no doubt about the result.""  He urged new leadership, saying, ""I will reassure the markets that British economy is strong. This will require strong leadership. I've been proud to be prime minister for six years."" By  July 13, 2016, David Cameron formally stepped down as prime minister, and after a meeting with Queen Elizabeth II, the UK's head of state, May became the new head of government and the second female to hold that post since Margaret Thatcher. In September 2016, Cameron further announced that he would be resigning from his position as an elected Member of Parliament. Cameron said that he would step down from his role as the elected representative of his Oxfordshire constituency, and allow someone else to take on that role.  He explained that his presence as a  ""back bencher"" in parliament was something of a distraction.  A by-election would be called to fill his seat. In October 2016, the new prime minister, Theresa May, announced that her country would trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty and begin the formal process of her country withdrawing from the European Union. May also foreclosed the notion of an early general election, noting that such a course would only augur instability in the UK.  Instead, ay said that she would advance the repeal the 1972 European Communities Act which took the United Kingdom into the European Common Market, now knowns as the European Union.  She said in an interview with the media, ""We will introduce, in the next Queen's speech, a Great Repeal Bill that will remove the European Communities Act from the statute book.""  The act would become effective upon the formal exit of the UK from the European Union. On March 29, 2017, United Kingdom Prime Minister Theresa May formally began the process known colloquially as ""Brexit' of withdrawing the United Kingdom from the United Kingdom.In keeping with Article 50 of the European Union's Lisbon Treaty, Prime Minister May notified European Union Council President Donald Tusk via a hand-delivered letter that her country would exit the European bloc after decades of participation dating back to 1973.In a speech to parliament, she declared, ""The United Kingdom is leaving the European Union."" She added, ""This is an historic moment from which there can be no turning back.""A difficult process lasting up to two years was in the offing whereby the United Kingdom would seek to negotiate the terms of its exit from the European Union. Those negotiations would largely center on the United Kingdom's relations with the European Union with regard to trade and security. With Brexit set to be finalized in 2019, intense negotiations went into effect in 2017 to set the conditions for the United Kingdom to disentangle itself from the European Union.By December 2017,  the two sides had reached some concurrence on a framework that would ensure an orderly exit by the United Kingdom from the European bloc.  The framework also outline the terms of future trade ties.

United Kingdom Prime Minister May hailed the achievement, saying, ""I very much welcome the prospect of moving ahead.""  The head of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, declared: ""I believe we have now made the breakthrough we needed.""

A continuing wrinkle would be the matter of disconnecting the British mainland from European Union regulations while maintaining those rules for Northern Ireland.  But for European negotiators, that was a problem for the United Kingdom to sort out.  The Brexit transition would commence on March 29, 2019, when the United Kingdom would leave the European Union, but would ensue over a phased basis of two years.  This process was thus dubbed ""the long divorce."" 

Prime Minister May retaliates after nerve agent poisoning of former Russian spies in UK March 2018 was marked by international spy intrigue worthy of a motion picture movie.  At issue were the alleged assassination attempt by Russia on Sergei Skripal, a former Russian spy living in the United Kingdom (U.K.), and his daughter, Yulia Skripal. U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May publicly accused Russia of being behind the attempted assassination, casting it as ""an unlawful use of force"" by the Russian state against the United Kingdom, and warning of consequences to follow if Russia did not answer for its actions by a specified deadline on March 13, 2018.  She declared: ""We will not tolerate such brazen attempt to murder innocent civilians on our soil."" For its part, Russia dismissed the charges and indicated that it would not be adhering to any such deadline to furnish an explanation.  Moreover, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov  asserted that Moscow was ""not to blame"" and asked for information about the nerve agent believed to have caused the poisoning of Skripal and his daughter.  It should be noted that the particular nerve agent used against Skripal and his daughter was linked with a constellation of chemical weapons identified as Novichok, which was developed by the former Soviet Union in the 1970s.  It should also be noted that the Skirpal case was not the first time poisoning of former Russian agents on British soil had ensued.  In 2006, the former Russian spy, Alexander Litvinenko, who was poisoned using radioactive tea. A British inquiry into the case found that Litvinenko's death was very likely orchestrated by the Russian state. Days after Prime Minister May's deadline elapsed, the British head of government announced the expulsion of 23 Russian diplomats from the United Kingdom.  There would also be a cessation of high level bilateral meetings with the Russians, as well as a boycott of the World Cup to be held in Russia later in 2018.Explaining her decision before parliament, May said, ""It is not in our national interest to break off all dialogue between the United Kingdom and the Russian Federation. But in the aftermath of this appalling act against our country, this relationship cannot be the same."" The move was the initial gesture of reprisal by the government of the United Kingdom to the poisoning spy fiasco, which was quickly being understood as a quasi-act of state-sponsored terrorism.  But Russia remained undeterred, with the Foreign Ministry issuing a statement that read: ""The British government has opted for confrontation with Russia. To be sure, our response will not be long in coming."" Note that Skripal and his daughter remained hospitalized and in critical condition at the time of writing.  Also note that as Prime Minister May was speaking about the Skirpal case,  UK authorities were opening a new  investigation -- this time into the mysterious death of Nikolai Glushkov, an associate of the deceased oligarch Boris Berezovsky, who was regarded as quite a rival of Russian President Vladimir Putin. 

Editor's Note on the United Kingdom:

Located in Western Europe, between the North Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea, just to the northwest of France, the United Kingdom is made up of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.  Northern Ireland is to be found on the northern one-sixth of the island of Ireland.

It should be noted that the terms ""Great Britain"" and ""United Kingdom"" cannot correctly be used in an interchangeable manner.Great Britain refers to the island to the west of France and east of Ireland that consists of three related regions -- England, Scotland, and Wales.  However, Great Britain is not the proper name of any current sovereign nation state, as it excludes Northern Ireland, which is also part of the country called  the United Kingdom.  In fact, the official name of the country is ""United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.""

Scotland and England were joined in 1603 when King James VI of Scotland succeeded his cousin, Queen Elizabeth I, to claim the British throne. In 1707, the Act of Union created a new country, Great Britain. Ireland had been conquered by the early 17th century, and the 1801 British Acts of Union established the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1922, 26 counties of Ireland gained independence from London, with the other six counties remaining in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

The Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales, and the Northern Ireland Assembly were established in 1999. The latter was suspended until May 2007 due to wrangling over the peace process, but devolution was fully completed in March 2010.

In 2013, a process was started to allow for a referendum for Scottish independence.  That vote was to take place in 2014.  In order for Scotland to become independent, regardless of the result of the internal referendum, the British Parliament would have to dissolve the Acts of Union.

At the beginning of the 20th century the British Empire had been the foremost global power, stretching over one-fourth of the earth's surface. But World War I significantly weakened the United Kingdom, and the years following World War II saw the demise of the empire with many colonies gaining independence. Nevertheless, the country remains a major world economic and military power, with considerable political and cultural influence around the world. As the world's first industrialized country, the economy of the United Kingdom is one of the largest in the world as well as one of the strongest in Europe, and is considered to be a leading trading power and financial center.

It should also be noted that the United Kingdom has historically played a leading role in developing parliamentary democracy and in advancing literature and science. The country has a long history as a major player in international affairs and fulfills an important role in the European Union, the United Nations and NATO. The United Kingdom is also an active member of the European Union, although it chose to remain outside the Economic and Monetary Union. The government has said a series of economic criteria must be met before the issue can be put to a referendum.

"Before 8 September 2018, will the UK request an extension to Article 50 for leaving the EU?
",581838,"POLITICAL parties have been accused of using Belfast City Council resources for campaigning. DUP councillor Lee Reynolds made the claim at the first meeting of the council's Brexit committee yesterday.

The committee has been set up to look at what implications the UK leaving the European Union on March 29, 2019 will have for Belfast.

Committee chair Seanna Walsh of Sinn Fein opened the inaugural meeting by telling members that its terms of reference include reflecting on areas of impact Brexit may have on Belfast, including economic and funding.

The first order of business was a motion of support for the socalled backstop option.

The EU has proposed a backstop which would mean Northern Ireland remaining with the EU customs union, large parts of the single market and the EU VAT system.

However, the UK suggests a backstop would see the UK as a whole remaining aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time after 2020.

The motion at the council committee was proposed by Sinn Fein's Arder Carson, who described the backstop as an ""insurance policy"".

He emphasised it should not be diluted, but rather extended.

The SDLP and Alliance Party backed the motion with minor amendments. SDLP councillor Donal Lyons told the committee the backstop was the ""bare minimum"", describing it as a ""safety net that we shouldn't fall beneath"".

But unionist parties opposed the motion.

The DUP's Brian Kingston directed his comments to the Sinn Fein members, accusing them of ""using the council"" because they are ""boycotting"" Westminster and the Assembly.

""EU negotiators and the UK Government are not waiting for the verdict of Belfast City Council before making their next move,"" he said.

""Sinn Fein could have influence at Westminster, which they boycott, or in the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Executive ... but there is a triple boycott going on.""

Mr Reynolds described the discussion as ""just ridiculous"", arguing that the committee had been given a remit and claimed the proposed motion and discussion went beyond it.

""What we have is political parties using council resources for their political campaigning,"" he told the committee.

Sinn Fein's Ciaran Beattie hit back, saying his party runs for Westminster on an absentionist ticket, and claiming that the Assembly remains collapsed due to ""DUP scandals"" and the party ""refusing rights"", including for Irish language speakers and equal marriage.

The motion was passed by 10 votes to seven, with Sinn Fein, the SDLP and the Alliance Party voting for, while the DUP, UUP and PUP voted against.

Belfast is the first council in Northern Ireland to have a dedicated committee to look at the potential impact of Brexit.

Council officers have been tasked with assessing the impact that Brexit may have on its services, and are undertaking an audit of services to identify the nature and extent of potential impact on funding, personnel, procurement/contracts and legislation.

The committee is next due to meet on September 20.",3,"The committee has been set up to look at what implications the UK leaving the European Union on March 29, 2019 will have for Belfast.

",720532,"The federal government plans to spend more than $2.2 million to fly roughly 3,000 police officers and dozens of German shepherds from all over the country to Quebec City to help secure the sites for next months G7 leaders summit.

The G7 leaders, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Theresa May, will meet June 8-9 inside a highly secured zone behind metal fences that wind through the now-fortified vacation town of La Malbaie.

The event is widely expected to attract protesters to La Malbaie and, in particular, to Quebec City, where the majority of international media will be stationed for the duration of the summit. Quebec City, however, is about a two hour drive away from La Malbaie and the public wont be able to get anywhere near the key sites.

Civil society groups planning to gather peacefully during the summit warn the imposing battalion of police and the webs of metal barriers will unduly constrain their democratic right to be heard.

In the past, however, some demonstrations outside major international summits have erupted into violence.

To ensure theres enough muscle on the ground to protect the G7 sites, Ottawa will start ferrying officers from the RCMP and other forces to Quebec City later this month on chartered flights from seven other provinces, according to a tender notice issued by the government.

Related government documents dated Tuesday show that Ottawa awarded three contracts for the chartered flights totalling more than $2.2 million.

These charter aircraft are required to transport an estimated 3,000 RCMP and other police forces personnel and their personal and duty-related belongings, from across Canada to perform various site security functions for the 2018 G7 summit, said the statement of work on the notice.

The contract says the RCMP requires planes that can transport up to 200 passengers per flight.

It also outlined specific carry-on requirements for those on board.

All passengers are peace officers who have an operational requirement to access their firearm immediately before and immediately after the flight and are therefore required to carry their unloaded personal firearm on board the aircraft, said the document.

Ammunition, it also noted, would be packed in the checked baggage.

The aircraft companies will also be required to transport dog masters and their police service dogs, which are described in the document as German shepherds each between 70 and 100 pounds. The dogs, up to three per flight, will be kept in crates while on board and their handlers will be responsible for caring for them during the flights, the notice said.

The contract also requires the aircraft companies to provide in-flight meals and snacks, but notes that they will be accompanied by non-alcoholic drinks.

The document includes an example flight schedule, which lists 26 flights to Quebec City before the summit starting May 23. There will be 16 return flights for the officers  the first one will leave Quebec City on June 9, the final day of the summit, the schedule said.

The thick security in the region is a big concern for organizations hoping to send messages to the powerful G7 leaders on issues ranging from income inequality, to the need for greater environmental protection, to Indigenous rights.

These types of measures  whether its thousands of police, or soldiers, or 10-foot fences, or millions of dollars spent on security  just push those voices away and its a further disconnect from the elite gathering that the G7 represents, said Brent Patterson, political director for the Council of Canadians.

Theyre trying to make it as unfriendly and unwelcoming as possible.

Pattersons organization is planning to participate in events in Quebec City and La Malbaie during the G7 and its members will try to get as close to the summit site as possible.

In its February budget, the federal government earmarked about $600 million to cover security and logistics for the leaders summit and other G7-related events Canada will host this year.

A separate tender notice, which closes Thursday, is seeking bids to supply the RCMP with 238 rental vehicles for the G7.

The fleet, the document said, must include 118 short-term rentals of seven-passenger vans to transport security personnel, employees and equipment.

Most of the vans will be used to provide security for delegates in several locations, including the Fairmont Le Manoir Richelieu, which will host the summit, the Quebec City airport and the Bagotville air force base, where the G7 leaders aircraft will touch down.

In addition, the notice said the Mounties also require another 57 vans, which each hold 15 passengers, and 63 full-size sedans. 2018 Global Data Point.",17,"The document includes an example flight schedule, which lists 26 flights to Quebec City before the summit starting May 23.",0.6246614456176758,5.731844425201416,1

                     Evacuated tourists arrive from nearby Gili Trawangan island at the port at Bangsal in Lombok                                             

Where are the Gili Islands?

The Gili Islands are located in the Lombok Strait, northwest of Lombok in Indonesia.

Bali, which also felt the tremors from Sunday's major quake, lies just 22 miles to the west of Gili Trawangan, the islands' most touristy member.

Both Bali and Lombok are visible from the Gili islandss in clear weather.

Is it safe to travel to the Gili islands?

Although no tourists have been reported amongst the dead, the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office updated their travel advice to Indonesia last night.

They advise against all but essential travel to the Gili Islands off the north-west coast of Lombok.

The statement issued by FCO reads ""Following the 6.9 magnitude earthquake in the region on 5 August, there is a risk of aftershocks, which could cause further damage to buildings and pose risks to safety.

                                          An aerial view of collapsed houses following earthquake in Lombok, Indonesia                                             

""In the event of serious injury, access to immediate medical assistance on the islands is extremely limited.

""The Indonesian authorities are working to assist people to leave the Gili Islands via boat to Lombok should they wish to do so.""

If you are travelling to Bali or Lombok in the coming days, FCO warns you should keep your travel plans under close review and seek advice of your transport and accommodation providers before travelling.

About 4,600 tourists have now been evacuated from the Gili islands, with hundreds crowding onto the beaches as they await transportation.

The warning comes following a series of earthquakes on 29 July, where the northeast of of the island of Lombok experienced a further earthquake of magnitude 6.9 on 5 August.

Initial reports indicate damage to buildings and casualties in Lombok and the Gili Islands and some damage to buildings in Bali.

The National Disaster Management Agency has put the official death toll at 98 - but this is expected to be much higher and will likely rise.

At least 142 people are expected to have been killed.

A tsunami warning was also issued in the aftermath of the quake, which occurred at a depth of 10 km , the Indonesian Meteorological Agency said.

However, this was later rescinded although officials have urged people to move away from the ocean.

The National Disaster Mitigation Agency 24-hour hotline can be contacted on +62 85792240799.

Director General of the Guyana Civil Defence Commission (CDC), Major Kester Craig, will be representing the country at the sixth Regional Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction in the Americas that will take place in Columbia from June 18-22.

The meeting aims to review experiences, progress and challenges in reducing the risk of disasters in the region and advance sustainable development through enhanced resilience to disasters in the Americas.

The meeting is being organised by the National Unit of Disaster Risk Management of Columbia in collaboration with the United Nations Office of Disaster Reduction along with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).

It will also examine monitoring tools and mechanisms used to report on the implementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction for the period 2015-2030.

A government statement said it has invested heavily in disaster risk reduction for resilience, particularly, in low-lying regions and that the CDC has completed regional plans for most regions across the country.

Meanwhile, Guyana will also attend an Outlook Forum on the Caribbean 2018 Hurricane Season that will be held in Barbados later this month.

",733085,"Travel Business Review - 10 August 2018London Gatwick has announced a new long-haul connection to Shanghai - China's largest city - as Gatwick recorded year-on-year long-haul growth of 20.8 percent in July.

The new service will be operated by China Eastern and will connect the UK to one of the world's leading business centres, providing over 70,000 seats and more than 3,700 metric tonnes of new cargo capacity each year. The new China Eastern Airlines service to Shanghai will begin on December 7, 2018. The Airbus A330-200 will depart from Gatwick on Tuesdays, Fridays and Sundays at 12:00 and will fly to Shanghai Pudong Airport.Stewart Wingate, CEO, Gatwick Airport said: 'I'm delighted to welcome China Eastern to Gatwick and look forward to the start of this vital new link to Shanghai which, like London, is undoubtedly one of the world's most important cities and business hubs. Starting from such a strong position gives this new route every chance of success, as it will be popular with business passengers travelling between the two economic centres, as well as leisure passengers keen to sample the excitement of China's largest city.'July's traffic figures demonstrate that Gatwick's long-haul network is driving the airport's growth. These connections to China and other non-European countries will take on extra significance in a post-Brexit Britain as we become more reliant on them to generate vital growth through trade and by exploiting the other business opportunities that they provide.'A global financial centre like London, Shanghai is at the centre of China's economic growth. It is also the leading city driving the Yangtze River Economic Zone - a region accounting for 20 percent of China's GDP and responsible for a third of the country's imports and exports, the airport said.The launch of the new route follows one of the busiest Julys in Gatwick's history, with cargo handled by the airport growing by 28.8 percent year-on-year.

",987512,"Travel to Cuba from Orlando International Airport is on the upswing, growing 196.7 percent from 10,284 passengers for the 12 months ending in February 2017 to 30,513 for the same period in 2018, all on JetBlue.

That jump has come despite President Donald Trump's move to reverse the policy of the previous administration which had begun easing trade and travel restrictions on Cuba. The island-nation has been under an embargo by the U.S. since the late Fidel Castro took over Cuba more than 50 years ago.

After those travel restrictions were eased by the Obama administration, the first commercial flight from Orlando International Airport to Havana, Cuba, was launched on July 8, 2015, by Swift Air operating for Island travel & Tours, although the charter ceased flying to Cuba in 2016. JetBlue, OIA's third-largest carrier, started daily non-stop service to Havana on Nov. 29, 2016.

JetBlue (Nasdaq: JBLU) served a total of 5.7 million passengers out of Orlando International in 2017, including 515,500 in March 2018, up 4.12percent from March 2017's 495,100 passengers.

However, the New York-based airline's number of passengers to Cuba decreased by 43 percent to 1,721 for the month of February 2018, the most recent figures available, when compared to February 2017's 3,031 passengers.

That drop may be related to the fact that last fall, the U.S. State Department issued a travel warning advising U.S. citizens to avoid travel to Cuba. The warning came after the withdrawal of some U.S. Embassy employees from Havana who were said to suffering ill effects of ""sonar attacks.""  

Metro Orlando is home to the fourth-largestCuban-American population in the country, with Cuban ancestry representing about 2 percent of the city's total population and 7.6 percent of Orlando's Hispanic population of 645,000, according to the Pew Research Center. With approximately 49,000 Cuban-American residents in the region, Orlando was one of only 10 U.S. cities to win direct commercial flights to Havana.

The Cuba flights are only one contribution to OIA's recent surge in passenger traffic. In fact, first-quarter 2018 was a record-setting period for passengers at OIA, with 12.04 million travelers passing through its gates, up 7.76 percent from the same time last year.

The bump was thanks to 309,000 new seats created from new flights from Delta, JetBlue, Spirit and Virgin Atlantic. The new flights tapped into new potential visitors to the region.

The bump in visitation also further cements the ongoing expansion at the airport, which includes more than $3 billion worth of improvements. Most notably, the increase in traffic supports the need for the $2.15 billion south terminal, set to debut by 2020. That new facility adds 16 new airline gates to the airport to accommodate more flights.

Passenger traffic is a vital indicator of the region's health. Central Florida's $70 billion tourism and travel industry, which welcomed a record-breaking 72 million visitors in 2017, depends on growth in visitation to support more investments such as new hotels, as well as new theme park rides and attractions.

"Will Somalia's President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed experience a significant leadership disruption before 1 September 2018?
",185615,"Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has lambasted Donald Trump over his decision to unilaterally pull the US out of the 2015 nuclear deal, saying that his statement was ""ludicrous and shallow"", as hardliners rejoiced at the US exit. 

""I say it on behalf of Iranian people, Mr Trump, you can't do a damn thing,"" said Khamenei, who wields ultimate power in Iran, a day after the US president broke with European allies over what he said was a ""horrible, one-sided"" agreement.

The Ayatollah said Trump's statement on the 2015 landmark nuclear deal, also known as the joint comprehensive plan of action (JCPOA), contained ""more than 10 lies"". He said: ""He both threatened the system as well as the nation... The body of this man, Trump, will turn to ashes and become the food of the worms and ants, while the Islamic Republic continues to stand.""

Hardliners in Iran have been given a new lease of political life with Trump's decision to torpedo the agreement and reimpose economic sanctions at the highest level, seizing on an opportunity to consolidate their power over reformists who championed the pact. 

On Wednesday the commander of Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guards congratulated the nation on the US exit. Mohammad Ali Jafari said: ""I congratulate and see as a good deed the vicious withdrawal of the US from JCPOA, which was not credible even before the withdrawal ... It was proved once more that US isn't trustworthy in regards its commitments.""

At the opening session of the Iranian parliament, a group of hardline MPs held up a paper US flag and the text of the JCPOA before setting fire to both and chanting ""death to America"".

The MPs' protest was a nod to Khamenei, who had said in June 2016, prior to Trump's election, that if the Americans ""tear it up, we will set it on fire"".

Khamenei said on Wednesday it was not feasible for Iran to continue implementing the agreement without making sure that the European partners in the agreement, the UK, France and Germany, could withstand US pressure. The EU wants to keep the agreement but a US exit might trigger a collapse of the deal because US sanctions will hamper European business with Tehran. 

 ""It is not logical to continue the implementation of the Iran deal without receiving enough guarantees from three European countries,"" Khamenei said. ""Now it is said that we continue [the deal] with the three countries. I even don't trust these three countries. Receive practical guarantees from them. If you can, that's fine. But if you cannot receive a guarantee, it will not be possible to continue implementing Barjam,"" he said, referring to the Persian acronym for the JCPOA. 

Ali Larijani, the speaker of the parliament, said Tehran would wait to gauge how the European partners in the nuclear talks would handle the US exit from the deal. His comments echoed those of the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, who has said the agreement could survive if Europe defies Trump.

The US exit from the agreement dominated Wednesday's newspaper front pages in Tehran. ""Barjam minus America,"" read the main headline on the front page of the reformist Ebtekar daily. ""US exit from Barjam puts an end to the world's trust in the empire of lies,"" Ettela'at's front page said. 

""Trump tore up the agreement, now it's time for us to set it on fire,"" read the front page headline of Kayhan, an ultra-conservative daily whose editor is appointed directly by Khamenei. 

Despite Rouhani's assurances that Iran is prepared to withstand the impact of a US exit, Trump's decision has revived worries of conflict inside Iran, where people are concerned about the state of its already fragile economy, and consequences for the fate of reformists.

On Tuesday night ordinary Iranians were on tenterhooks, monitoring any immediate impact on the country's national currency, and prompting panic-buying of hard-to-find dollars amid political uncertainty. The rial traded at the all-time low on Wednesday. One US dollar was exchanged for 75,000 rials. <br>

Sadegh Zibakalam, a prominent political commentator and professor of politics at Tehran University, struck a pessimistic tone about the consequences of Trump's decision.

""Many people are worried about war,"" he told the Guardian by phone from Tehran. ""Whenever the country faces a crisis in its foreign policy or economy, the situation gets better for hardliners, they'd be able to exert their force more easily."" 

He added: ""At the same time, hardliners will gain politically from this situation, because they'll attack reformists and moderates like [President] Rouhani that this is evidence of what they had been saying for years, that the US cannot be trusted, and that the US is always prepared to knife you in the back."" 

Foad Izadi, a Tehran-based conservative political analyst, said Trump's aim was to confront Iran with greater force but that it could withstand the pressure. ""For 40 years, we have been living under sanctions. The collapse of the nuclear deal will mean that we have to find ways to circumvent sanctions, something we have done in the past,"" he said.

For ordinary Iranians, however, the prospects are gloomy. One, Arash Tavanafar, said the psychological pressure of Trump's decision on the Iranian population could prove more powerful than its economic effect. ""The psychological pressure and worry is destroying us, especially the youth, because we neither have any trust in this political system, nor any hope for its reform. We've only become spectators of its downfall,"" he said. 

Mohammad, a postdoctoral student, said Trump's decision would undermine moderates in Iran as the country might have to name a new supreme leader in the coming years. Khamenei is 78, and there has been speculation over his health. ""Moderates can play a significant role in the appointment of the new leader if they're not weakened, something that can hugely affect the future generations in the country,"" Mohammad said.

""I say it on behalf of Iranian people, Mr Trump, you can't do a damn thing,"" said Khamenei, who wields ultimate power in Iran, a day after the US president broke with European allies over what he said was a ""horrible, one-sided"" agreement. The Ayatollah said Trump's statement on the 2015 landmark nuclear deal, also known as the joint comprehensive plan of action (JCPOA), contained ""more than 10 lies"". He said: ""He both threatened the system as well as the nation... The body of this man, Trump, will turn to ashes and become the food of the worms and ants, while the Islamic Republic continues to stand."" Hardliners in Iran have been given a new lease of political life with Trump's decision to torpedo the agreement and reimpose economic sanctions at the highest level, seizing on an opportunity to consolidate their power over reformists who championed the pact. On Wednesday the commander of Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guards congratulated the nation on the US exit. Mohammad Ali Jafari said: ""I congratulate and see as a good deed the vicious withdrawal of the US from JCPOA, which was not credible even before the withdrawal ... It was proved once more that US isn't trustworthy in regards its commitments."" At the opening session of the Iranian parliament, a group of hardline MPs held up a paper US flag and the text of the JCPOA before setting fire to both and chanting ""death to America"". The MPs' protest was a nod to Khamenei, who had said in June 2016, prior to Trump's election, that if the Americans ""tear it up, we will set it on fire"". Khamenei said on Wednesday it was not feasible for Iran to continue implementing the agreement without making sure that the European partners in the agreement, the UK, France and Germany, could withstand US pressure. The EU wants to keep the agreement but a US exit might trigger a collapse of the deal because US sanctions will hamper European business with Tehran. ""It is not logical to continue the implementation of the Iran deal without receiving enough guarantees from three European countries,"" Khamenei said. ""Now it is said that we continue [the deal] with the three countries. I even don't trust these three countries. Receive practical guarantees from them. If you can, that's fine. But if you cannot receive a guarantee, it will not be possible to continue implementing Barjam,"" he said, referring to the Persian acronym for the JCPOA. Ali Larijani, the speaker of the parliament, said Tehran would wait to gauge how the European partners in the nuclear talks would handle the US exit from the deal. His comments echoed those of the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, who has said the agreement could survive if Europe defies Trump. The US exit from the agreement dominated Wednesday's newspaper front pages in Tehran. ""Barjam minus America,"" read the main headline on the front page of the reformist Ebtekar daily. ""US exit from Barjam puts an end to the world's trust in the empire of lies,"" Ettela'at's front page said. ""Trump tore up the agreement, now it's time for us to set it on fire,"" read the front page headline of Kayhan, an ultra-conservative daily whose editor is appointed directly by Khamenei. Despite Rouhani's assurances that Iran is prepared to withstand the impact of a US exit, Trump's decision has revived worries of conflict inside Iran, where people are concerned about the state of its already fragile economy, and consequences for the fate of reformists. On Tuesday night ordinary Iranians were on tenterhooks, monitoring any immediate impact on the country's national currency, and prompting panic-buying of hard-to-find dollars amid political uncertainty. The rial traded at the all-time low on Wednesday. One US dollar was exchanged for 75,000 rials. Sadegh Zibakalam, a prominent political commentator and professor of politics at Tehran University, struck a pessimistic tone about the consequences of Trump's decision. ""Many people are worried about war,"" he told the Guardian by phone from Tehran. ""Whenever the country faces a crisis in its foreign policy or economy, the situation gets better for hardliners, they'd be able to exert their force more easily."" He added: ""At the same time, hardliners will gain politically from this situation, because they'll attack reformists and moderates like [President] Rouhani that this is evidence of what they had been saying for years, that the US cannot be trusted, and that the US is always prepared to knife you in the back."" Foad Izadi, a Tehran-based conservative political analyst, said Trump's aim was to confront Iran with greater force but that it could withstand the pressure. ""For 40 years, we have been living under sanctions. The collapse of the nuclear deal will mean that we have to find ways to circumvent sanctions, something we have done in the past,"" he said. For ordinary Iranians, however, the prospects are gloomy. One, Arash Tavanafar, said the psychological pressure of Trump's decision on the Iranian population could prove more powerful than its economic effect. ""The psychological pressure and worry is destroying us, especially the youth, because we neither have any trust in this political system, nor any hope for its reform. We've only become spectators of its downfall,"" he said. Mohammad, a postdoctoral student, said Trump's decision would undermine moderates in Iran as the country might have to name a new supreme leader in the coming years. Khamenei is 78, and there has been speculation over his health.

",479592,"Hundreds of demonstrators shouted anti-American chants at rallies in Tehran and other Iranian cities on Friday, protesting against US President Donald Trump's Tuesday decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal.

They chanted, “Mr. Trump you cannot do a damn thing,” and, “We fight. We die. We don’t surrender,” in streets festooned with anti-US and anti-Israeli banners and posters.

“For the past four decades during Friday prayers, hundreds and sometimes thousands of staunch government supporters gather and chant ‘death to America’,” said FRANCE 24 Tehran correspondent Reza Sayah. “But ever since 2015, when Iran, the US and the other signatories signed the nuclear deal, those ‘death to America’ chants had been milder.”

On Friday “they were perhaps louder than they have ever been,” Sayah observed. The demonstrators “were mostly hardliners, religious conservatives, who have long mistrusted the US and say that the US withdrawal shows that Iran should never have trusted them – not the Obama Administration, not the Trump Administration.”

‘Iran’s enemies cannot be trusted’

A member of Iran’s clerical elite expressed similar sentiments on Friday. “America cannot do a damn thing. They have always been after the toppling of Iran’s regime and this exit is in line with that aim,” Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami said in a televised address to worshippers at Tehran University.

“These European signatories (to the deal) also cannot be trusted [...] Iran's enemies cannot be trusted,” Khatami added.

The JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) – as the Iran deal is formally known – was signed by the UK, France, Germany and the EU, along with Iran, the US, Russia and China.

Foreign minister’s diplomatic tour

For his part, Iran's foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif will embark on a diplomatic tour to try to salvage the nuclear deal.

He will leave late Saturday for visits to Beijing, Moscow and Brussels, a spokesman said Friday, holding meetings with all five of the remaining parties to the 2015 nuclear deal.

Along with Rouhani, Zarif is widely regarded as one of the moderates in the Iranian government.

“The moderates, of course, were not chanting ‘death to America’, but they, too, are disappointed,” said Sayah. “They were hoping that this nuclear deal would deliver a better economy, better relations with the West – obviously that hasn’t happened.”

The key question moving forward for Iran’s moderate President Hassan Rouhani is: Will the moderates, and the hardliners who were out on the street today, unite and rise up against him?”

This is Amnesty International's latest report on human rights in his country: ""Dissent was ruthlessly suppressed, with journalists, political activists and human rights defenders among those targeted.   ""Instances of torture continued to be reported, but in lower numbers than in the weeks following the coup attempt of July 2016.   ""Any effective investigation of human rights violations by state officials was prevented by pervasive impunity.""   Prime Ministers of all parties have had to deal with some undesirable heads of state over the years.   Robert Mugabe, Nicolae Ceausescu and, most recently, Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman have all been bestowed state visits.

But there is a growing fear the consequences of Brexit mean we will have to sacrifice more of our moral authority on the altar of economic deal-making.   We have already seen the spectacle of Liam Fox claiming Britain had ""shared values"" with Rodrigo Duterte, the brutal leader of the Philippines.   It is especially rich that those Brexiteers who twisted the threat of Turkey's potential membership of the EU to win referendum are now happy to kow-tow before Erdogan on his visit to London.   Boris Johnson, who played on fears about Turkey's during the campaign andinsulted Erdogan in a lewd poem, has since suggested we can do a ""new jumbo free trade deal"" with the country.   Mrs May's press conference with Erdogan this afternoon could prove uncomfortable.   Will the Prime Minister dare to challenge the Turkish President on his human rights record?   And will she join Erdogan incondemning the slaughter in Gaza?He has accused Israel of ""genocide"" and said the US shared responsibility with Israel for a ""vile massacre.""

Incredibly, Donald Trump was last week being touted as a possible winner of the Nobel Peace Prize.   Our timid Prime Minister has a tendency to avoid confrontation so don't expect her to find her voice today if asked to condemn America's actions.   The Cabinet committee on Brexit meets today without any expectation of a breakthrough on the customs plans.

You suspect Labour's reluctance to embrace the EEA option, which is gaining favour with a few Brexiteer Tories, has less to do with Corbyn's latent eurosceptism and is driven more by the fear of alienating further Labour supporting Leave voters.

DOHA — Qatar's Emir held talks on Monday with the Somali president in Doha and pledged support for the East African country, amid tensions between the two countries and the UAE. Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani said that the relationship between Qatar and Somalia was one of 'brotherhood and mutual respect'. 'Qatar will continue to support the unity, stability, sovereignty and well-being of the people of Somalia,' he wrote on Twitter. The meeting between the Emir and President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed comes at a particularly sensitive time. Qatar is fast approaching the first anniversary of an entrenched political dispute, which has seen it isolated by neighbouring former allies including the UAE. African countries have found themselves in the fallout over the bitter Gulf crisis, with several breaking off ties with Qatar in support for countries which oppose Doha. Somalia has refused to take sides, although in recent weeks it has had its own disagreements with the UAE rulers. A row over the management of Berbera port has prompted Mogadishu to ban Dubai-headquartered company DP World from doing business in Somalia. The decision was followed by Somali authorities intercepting a plane last month chartered by Emirati diplomats, before reportedly confiscating almost $10 million cash.

President Trump unveils his plan to reduce drug prices saying he's out to eliminate the middle man.

Was there a mole inside the Trump presidential campaign?

And our ""Whatever Happened To"" segment focuses on a marine veteran turned journalist kidnapped by terrorists in Syria.

This is SPECIAL REPORT.

Good evening. Welcome to Washington. I'm Bret Baier.

President Trump says his proposal to cut prescription drug prices is an effort to derail the special interest gravy train encouraged by Obamacare. And he says he will make sure the rich middlemen won't be so rich anymore.

Chief White House correspondent John Roberts starts us off tonight as he often does with the President's pill plan. Good evening -- John.

JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Bret -- good evening to you.

This is a day that the major drug companies have been dreading for a couple of years. Since the campaign President Trump has promised to put the screws to big pharma. Today he began that process in earnest.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

ROBERTS: In a week dominated by foreign policy and now new elements of palace intrigue, President Trump today turned to domestic policy aiming to make good on a campaign promise to lower prescription drug costs.

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Today my administration is launching the most sweeping action in history to lower the price of prescription drugs for the American people.

ROBERTS: The President's plan is to attack the problem on multiple fronts, encourage innovation, promote price competition, address foreign freeloading. The White House claims the U.S. shoulders an unfair burden of drug development costs as other nations force pharmaceutical companies to deeply discount drug prices.

Lowering drug costs is one priority for the White House; another is fixing immigration. In an interview with NPR, chief of staff John Kelly said a big problem with illegal immigration is that many people are unable to fit in to American society.

""They're not MS-13 but they are not a people that would easily assimilate in the United States,"" Kelly said. ""They're overwhelmingly rural people -- 4th, 5th, 6th great educations are kind of the norm. They don't integrate well. They don't have skills.""

The President's frustration over immigration boiled over in Wednesday's cabinet meeting. Sources telling Fox News he berated DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen over the number of illegal immigrants still crossing the border demanding to know why the border was not secure.

Amid reports Nielsen was on the verge of quitting after the tirade, DHS released a statement saying, ""The article alleging that the Secretary drafted a resignation letter yesterday and was close to resigning is false."" However this afternoon, chief of staff Kelly told Fox News after the cabinet meeting he called Nielsen urging her to not quit over the verbal assault.

Kelly also weighed in on the Russia investigation in the NPR interview saying, ""It's a weight on the President.""

JOHN KELLY, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: There may not be a cloud, but certainly the President is somewhat embarrassed, frankly, when world leaders come in. You know, Bibi Netanyahu was here and he was under investigation himself and it's like he walked in and you know, the first couple of minutes of every conversation might revolve around that, that kind of thing.

ROBERTS: This afternoon Kelly modified his comments, insisting distraction is a better way to characterize the effect the Russia investigation is having on the White House.

And there was more news in the Michael Cohen investigation. In a message to employees today, the CEO of AT&T saying, ""There is no other way to say it. AT&T hiring Michael Cohen as a political consultant was a big mistake."" Randall Stephenson insisting there was nothing illegal about it but that associating with Cohen was ""a serious misjudgment"".

In the daily briefing, press secretary Sarah Sanders said the Cohen case proves President Trump can't be bought as AT&T never got government approval for the merger it was seeking.

SARAH SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: This further proves that the President is not going to be influenced by special interest. This is actually the definition of draining the swamp, something the President talked about repeatedly during the campaign.

ROBERTS: The White House today also refused to publicly apologize to Senator John McCain after a staffer made a heartless comment about him. In a staff meeting yesterday discussing McCain's opposition to Gina Haspel for CIA director, Kelly Sadler, the director of surrogate communications said, ""He's dying anyway.""

Sadler called McCain's daughter Meghan to apologize but the press secretary had nothing to add today.

SANDERS: I'm not going to validate a leak out of an internal staff meeting one way or the other.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

ROBERTS: On drug prices, HHS Secretary Alex Azar today said President Trump wants to take a business-oriented approach to lowering drug prices as opposed to a bureaucratic one. Be he acknowledge the system is as complex as rocket science and that it will take months at least before consumers see any difference -- Bret.

BAIER: John Roberts, live on the north lawn. John -- thank you.

Was there a mole in the Trump presidential campaign? The possibility that somebody inside the effort (ph)was being paid by someone on the outside has Republicans working overtime tonight here in the nation's capital.

Chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge tells us what she is hearing.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT: A source close to the matter tells Fox News there is renewed interest by congressional investigators in the 300-page August 2017 congressional testimony from Glenn Simpson, the co-founder of Fusion GPS, the firm behind the unverified Trump dossier.

In January the Senate Judiciary Committee's ranking Democrat Senator Dianne Feinstein unilaterally released a transcript that detailed Simpson's business relationships with former British spy Christopher Steele who was paid for opposition research on the Trump campaign.

Simpson told Senate investigators, quote, ""Essentially what Steele told me was that they had other intelligence about this matter from an internal Trump campaign source,"" and that ""My understanding was that the FBI believed Chris at this point that they believe Chris' information might be credible.""

The chairmen of the House Intelligence and Oversight Committees Devin Nunes and Trey Gowdy want records related to a human intelligence source as part of their investigation of alleged government surveillance abuse during the 2016 election. Congressional investigators want to know if there is a connection to the same source that appears in the Simpson testimony.

At the Justice Department Thursday, the members were briefed but did not review the records which so far have been withheld by the FBI, Justice Department and intelligence officials on the basis the source could be compromised.

REP. DARRELL ISSA (R-CA), HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE: What we are clearly on to is information showing that the Department of Justice has once again, along with the FBI, exceeded the authority. In this case the material that Devin Nunes is looking for will embarrass, no question at all, the Department of Justice and the FBI and is likely to represent at least misconduct if not breaking of the law.

HERRIDGE: After the testimony was public, anonymous sources reported that Simpson was talking about former Trump campaign associate George Papadopoulos or an Australian diplomat. Simpson did not respond to requests for comment.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

HERRIDGE: Fox News was told the records are significant to the House investigation as the Trump dossier used by the FBI and Justice Department to secure a surveillance warrant for Trump campaign aide.

The Republican chairman said the dialogue will continue next week. A Justice Department spokeswoman said they welcome the opportunity to work on a resolution and accommodate the request -- Bret.

BAIER: Catherine -- thank you.

HERRIDGE: You're welcome.

BAIER: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is framing the prospects of a nuclear deal with North Korea in terms of echoing Ronald Reagan's position on similar discussions with Russia in the 1980s -- trust but verify.

Pompeo hosted his first news conference as America's top diplomat following his latest for effort to arrange a history-making meeting between the leaders of the two countries.

Correspondent Rich Edson shows us what happened today at the State Department.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Permanent, complete and verifiable -- the dismantling of the North Korea nuclear program. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that's the goal of the upcoming summit between President Trump and Kim Jong-un.

As for what that specifically means --

MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: In order to achieve that it will require a robust verification program, one that we will undertake with partners around the world which will achieve that outcome in a way that frankly no agreement before it has ever set forth.

EDSON: Pompeo has just returned to the State Department after his second round of discussions with Kim Jong-un in Pyongyang. He also brought back with him three, now-formerly, imprisoned American citizens. The Secretary's first public meeting after that trip -- South Korea foreign minister Kang Kyung Wha. She emphasized the U.S.-led alliance refuses to offer North Korea any relief from international sanctions before the summit between the President and Kim.

KANG KYUNG WHA, SOUTH KOREA FOREIGN MINISTER: Well, we're very clear that the sanctions remain in place until and unless we see visible, meaningful action taken by North Korea on the denuclearization track.

EDSON: Kang also says the substantial U.S. military presence in her country is off the table in these upcoming talks.

Secretary Pompeo has had more substantive conversations perhaps more than any other westerner with Kim Jong-un. He is the dictator of a country known as the Hermit Kingdom for its isolation and brutality.

What is it like to talk to him?

POMPEO: Our conversations were warm. We were each representing our two countries trying our best to make sure that we were communicating clearly. We talked about the fact that America has often in history had adversaries who we are now close partners with and our hope that we could achieve the same with respect to North Korea.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

EDSON: And they may see each other again soon. A senior U.S. official says representatives from the United States and North Korea agreed to meet again to discuss more details about this upcoming summit between the President and Kim Jong-un -- Bret.

BAIER: Rich Edson, live at the State Department. Rich -- thank you.

A top Russian official says shared disapproval of the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal may drive Russia and European nations closer. President Vladimir Putin's foreign affairs advisor says Russia and its former Soviet allies will sign a previously negotiated free trade pact with Iran next week.

At least one Palestinian was killed and 900 wounded during another Friday filled with protests along the Gaza border with Israel.

Meanwhile Syria's president is warning that fighting between the U.S. and Russia in his country could lead to a greater conflict. And Iran's leadership is once again vilifying both Americans and Israelis.

Correspondent Benjamin Hall has the latest tonight from Jerusalem.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

BENJAMIN HALL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: ""Death to America, death to Israel"" -- chanted across Iran today as protesters took to the streets following this week's U.S. withdrawal from the Iran deal.

In a fiery speech in Tehran, the Supreme Leader Khatami warned Israel that the Israeli cities of Tel-Aviv and Haifa will be destroyed if Israel acted foolishly.

It comes as the extensive Israel air strikes on Iranian positions carried out in Syria yesterday becomes clearer -- satellite images showing the damage done to some of 50 sites hit in the 70 coordinated strikes. Israel claims they wiped out almost of Iranian military facilities in Syria.

Now Israel warning Assad to turn his back on the Iranians, an improbable request as Assad is indebted to Tehran for keeping him in power during the long civil war.

AVIGDOR LIEBERMAN, ISRAELI DEFENSE MINISTER (through translator): Get rid of (AUDIO GAP). Get rid of Qasem Soleimani and the Qud Force. They are not helping you. They only cause damage. And their presence will only cause problems.

HALL: Pressure is also mounting on Israel's border with Gaza -- thousands of Gazan residents now gathering for a seventh weekly protest aimed at shaking off a decade-old blockade of their territory. Fifty-three have died and thousands have been injured. The protest comes just three days ahead of what the Hamas leader says will be a march by tens of thousands who could burst through the border fence into Israel.

He has said Monday's crowd will be unarmed and peaceful but also compared it to a starving tiger and those protests are timed to coincide with the opening of the new U.S. embassy in Jerusalem on Monday, something which many fear could provoke more violence.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

HALL: And despite strong U.S. support for Israel, there are still many countries around the world who disapprove of President Trump's decision to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem and also his decision to pull out of the Iran deal. And that means that there are more tensions in this otherwise volatile region -- Bret.

BAIER: Benjamin Hall, live in Jerusalem. Benjamin -- thank you.

Up next, one major American industry is feeling the pressure from new tariffs between the U.S. and China. We'll go live to California for the facts.

First, here's what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight.

Fox 29 in Philadelphia as Starbucks opens its bathrooms to everyone, not just customers. This follows last months' arrest of two African-American men at one of its coffee shops in Philadelphia. The Starbucks chairman says while he does not want the company to become a public bathroom, he feels employees can make the right decision 100 percent of the time if that choice is removed at the store level.

WBOC in Salisbury, Maryland as Delaware becomes the first state in the nation to completely ban marriage for anyone under the age of 18. The measure makes it illegal for minors to get married even if their parents approve. Previously anyone could get married in the state at any age with a judge's approval.

And this is a live look at Los Angeles from Fox 11. The big story there tonight, authorities say a 14-year-old used a rifle to shoot a classmate at their high school in Palmdale. Police say the suspect dumped the gun in the desert before being caught at a nearby shopping center. The victim, also 14, was shot in the arm and is expected to fully recover. Investigators say the incident stems from a dispute between the shooter and the victim but they're still trying to pin down the exact motive.

That's tonight's live look outside the Beltway from SPECIAL REPORT.

We'll be right back.

BAIER: The U.S. Postal Service is asking the government for greater freedom to raise stamp prices. The latest request comes as the service reports a quarterly loss of $1.3 billion from January to March and attributes that deficit to increased competition in the e-commerce age, rising fuel costs and added wage expenses as it grows its package business.

Stocks were mixed today. The Dow gained 92. The S&P 500 was up 5. The Nasdaq lost 2. For the week, the Dow jumped two and a third percentage points. The S&P 500 was up almost two and a half. The Nasdaq gained two and two-thirds.

America is the world's top producer of almonds -- did you know that? And China is the industry's third largest export destination. But the prospect of a new trade war has California almond growers nervous -- very nervous.

Fox's Hillary Vaughn is at an almond farm in Bakersfield right now. Good evening -- Hillary.

HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good evening -- Bret.

Well, Kern County is the largest exporter of almonds in the world. I talked to several almond growers here and they all tell me that these tariffs are not only bad for the U.S. they are also bad for China and they are already causing problems between Chinese buyers and California suppliers.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

MIKE YOUNG, WIGIS (ph) RANCH PARTNER: This not only hurts the American farmer but it hurts the China consumer. Not only will it hinder supply a little bit but their cost of food are going to go up because of it. The biggest impact to us under these tariffs is the lack of a marketplace. We're going to have to develop new marketplaces to sell our crop.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

VAUGHN: Growers tell me there is one country, though, benefiting from these tariffs -- Australia. The number two almond exporter is in place to scoop up U.S. supply overseas. The country just closed a zero percent tariff deal with China and that puts growers here at a huge price advantage because California nuts are 25 percent more expensive.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

HOLLY KING, ALMOND BOARD OF CALIFORNIA: Almonds were on the water when the tariff went up and the question becomes who's going to pay for it? So I think that's going to be the question -- will this affect the ability to compete with other countries?

(END VIDEO CLIP)

VAUGHN: But Australia can't single-handedly meet the demand in China without pulling some of their nuts out of other parts of the world which opens up opportunity for growers here to expand into untapped markets like Indonesia, South America and Korea.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

YOUNG: I think the end goal ultimately for the U.S. is going to be a good thing. Do I like to be the punching bag because of it? No, not at all.

VAUGHN: Some farmers see these tariffs as political attacks against the President. Trump carried Kern County by 15 points in 2016 but still these growers don't like being caught in the middle of this trade tug-of-war between the White House and Beijing. Some growers are holding their breath hoping a deal is worked out in the next 60 days -- Bret.

BAIER: Hillary Vaughn, live in Bakersfield. Hillary -- thanks.

The national park around Hawaii's Kilauea volcano is now off-limits to visitors. The park was closed last night amid fears the volcano will blow its top in the coming days possibly hurling ash and boulders the size of refrigerators miles into the air. The volcano has been sputtering lava for about a week, destroying 36 structures and forcing about 2,000 people to evacuate that area.

A hugely controversial farm bill in the House includes new restrictions and requirements concerning food stamps. And that has Democrats lining up to try to take it down.

Chief congressional correspondent Mike Emanuel tells us where things stand tonight.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Next week, the house is expected to debate a 5-year farm bill with a big push from President Trump to require able-bodied adults to work or get job training in order to collect food stamps.

TRUMP: We love our farmers. We're taking care of our farmers.

EMANUEL: And while there was a hint of a veto threat from the White House, the House agriculture chairman says the President is on board.

REP. MIKE CONAWAY (R), TEXAS: He likes what's (INAUDIBLE) in the House version of the farm bill -- good, strong work requirements. We did not talk about a veto. I asked him for his support for the farm bill to try to get it out of the House.

EMANUEL: Republicans note the last time unemployment was 3.9 percent back in 2000 there were 17 million people on food stamps. Today with that same jobless rate, there are more than 41 million people on the program.

Some Democrats are calling this the most partisan farm bill in 20 years and are warning about hitting the food stamps program with a sledgehammer.

REP. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI (D), ILLINOIS: Let's come to the table. Let's figure out ways of stamping out waste, fraud and abuse that aren't going to, you know, do a disservice to the mission of the food stamp program which is to help people address their food insecurity and fight hunger.

EMANUEL: With tougher work requirements, GOP leaders say the vast majority of Democrats in the House are expected to vote no.

REP. MARCIA FUDGE (D), OHIO: What we have determined is that there is no possible way we can support this bill.

EMANUEL: Another sensitive subject is the sugar program which includes import restrictions and floor price which critics say results in more expensive sugar.

REP. PAUL RYAN (R), WISCONSIN, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: I've long had views that the sugar program needs reforming. But what I am most interested in is getting a farm bill passed into law.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

EMANUEL: That's a reference to the concern some have that a sugar amendment could be a poison pill. Their argument is passing major food stamp reform should take priority over the sugar issue -- Bret.

BAIER: We'll follow it. Mike Emanuel, live on the Hill. Mike -- thanks.

Up next, just how bad is the problem of Russian hackers breaking into American election computers? And what comes this year?

First beyond our borders tonight.

An Afghan official says Taliban fighters have stormed the security post in a far off province killing at least seven and wounding four. A spokesman for the provincial governor there says the gun battle lasted several hours and at least seven security forces were killed.

A family of seven including four children was found dead with gunshot wounds today at a rural property in Southwest Australia. Police say it could be the country's worst mass shooting in 22 years. Police are not commenting on the possibility of a murder-suicide but they say the are not looking for a suspect.

Meantime Japan's prime minister says his country will not provide major economic assistance to North Korea unless it resolves the issue of Japanese citizens abducted decades ago. Shinzo Abe said in a televised interview the abductees must be released. Japan says North Korea abducted at least 17 Japanese citizens in the 1970s and 80s to train spies. After decades of denial North Korea in 2002 acknowledged abducting 13 people.

Just some of the other stories beyond our borders tonight.

We'll be right back.

BAIER: A federal appeals court has reinstated a challenge to Seattle's first in the nation law allowing drivers of ride hailing companies such as Uber and Lyft to unionize. A three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously said the measure is subject to challenge under federal anti-trust law. Supporters say Seattle's law makes the industry safer. Opponents say it will raise prices and stifle competition.

We are learning more tonight about Russian-backed efforts to break into the U.S. election system. Senior correspondent Eric Shawn tells us tonight one off the places affected is pretty far off the beaten path.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

ERIC SHAWN, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Galesburg, Illinois -- a typical small town was in the last presidential election invaded by the Russians. The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security say the state's voter registration rolls were hacked by Russian intelligence.

STEVEN SANDVOSS, ILLINOIS STATE BOARD OF ELECTION: In a sense it's a declaration of war. It's a cyber war.

Steven Sandvoss, the supervisor of the Illinois state board of elections says the attack lasted for weeks.

SANDVOSS: Elections being, you know, a central part of our democracy being attacked by a foreign government -- I think everybody in the country should be concerned about that.

SHAWN: He says hackers struck the states voter rolls starting in June of 2016 in the heat of the Presidential election, at one point hitting the system five times per second.

In some cases voter names, addresses, the last four digits of social security numbers and other personal voting information were accessed. The board says up to 76,000 voter registrations were breached with the greatest concentration 14,121 in the city of Galesburg -- that almost half the city's population.

Galesburg Mayor John Pritchard takes it in stride.

MAYOR JOHN PRITCHARD, GALESBURG, ILLINOIS: The Russians would be making a serious mistake if they came here with hostile intentions.

SHAWN: The hackers apparently stumbled on the city's nine-digit voter computer number randomly. The feds traced the attack to seven I.P. addresses in the Netherlands, including two groups, they are linked to Russian intelligence.

Officials say they have now employed numerous defenses to guard voter information including downloading daily anti-virus protections and monitoring servers.

State senator Michael Hastings chairs the cyber committee and has held hearings on securing the voting system. He is a 37-year-old graduate of West Point and was deployed to Iraq. He now battles any cyber enemy that has attacked his state and country.

SEN. MICHAEL HASTINGS (D), ILLINOIS: The fact that I fought to protect our democracy I hold this very sacred. And I'll do anything I can to protect it.

I'm Eric Shawn, Fox News.

BAIER: In tonight's ""Whatever Happened To"" segment, efforts to recover an American Marine turned journalist kidnapped by terrorists in Syria. Here's chief correspondent Jonathan Hunt.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

DEBRA TICE, MOTHER: First thing in the morning, last thing at night, all day long.

JONATHAN HUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: This Mother's Day as she does every day, Debra Tice will be thinking of her son, Austin.

DEBRA TICE: I pray for him to be strengthened and comfort, and that his captors will treat him humanely.

HUNT: Austin Tice served in Afghanistan as a marine and then became a journalist and was working in Syria when he was kidnapped in August, 2012. This disturbing video was the last the world saw of Austin, whose compassion was displayed recently at his alma mater of Georgetown University in an exhibition of his photos of Syrian children. His parents as well as the U.S. government, which is offering $1 million reward for information leading to Austin's safe return, are sure he is alive.

DEBRA TICE: I have always been 100 percent confident.

MARC TICE, FATHER: Austin is alive. He is living in captivity. We are sure he wants to come home and get his freedom back. And that's what we want.

HUNT: Marc and Debra Tice also say there has been a new, more aggressive approach since President Trump took office, and for the first time they revealed the president made them a promise when they met him in March.

DEBRA TICE: He said we're going to get him home.

MARC TICE: And that has been the response from everyone in the White House and the administration that we've talked to. They are committed to bringing him home. So you can't ask for more than that from your own government.

HUNT: What's the first thing you are going to do when he comes home?

(LAUGHTER)

MARC TICE: Oh, give him a big hug, whoop and holler. Yes.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

HUNT: And Marc and Debra also told us that in the tradition of the Tice family Austin's six siblings plan to give him a pretty hard time as punishment for the trouble he's caused them. Here is hoping they get that chance very soon. Bret?

BAIER: Jonathan, thank you.

President Trump says he will reduce prescription drug prices and cut out the middleman. We will get an update on that plus the latest on the Russian collusion probe, all the news today. The panel joins me after the break.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Today my administration is launching the most sweeping action in history to lower the price of prescription drugs for the American people. We are going to take on one of the biggest obstacles to affordable medicine, the tangled web of special interests. We are not going to reward companies that constantly raise prices. We are very much eliminating the middleman.

We will work with Congress to pass legislation that will save Americans even more money at the pharmacy.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BAIER: After a week of foreign policy the president turning his focus domestically, trying to get pharmaceutical prices down. How to do that is the real question. Drug pricing goals, increased competition in the drug markets, you heard him there, give Medicare Part D plans better tools to negotiate on behalf of senior citizens, decision new incentives for drug manufacturers, develop options to lower patients' out of pocket spending.

You have got these prescription drugs in the U.S., 18,000 plus approved and available, and this number, $328 billion spent on drugs. And 49 percent of Americans have used a prescription drug in the last 30 days. Amazing stats as you go down the line there.

Let's start there and bring in our panel, Steve Hayes, editor in chief for ""The Weekly Standard,"" Karen Tumulty, opinion writer for the ""Washington Post,"" and Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at ""The Federalist."" Karen, ambitious for the president to go down this road. We have seen other administrations try to do it. What about this?

KAREN TUMULTY, OPINION WRITER, ""WASHINGTON POST"": He did however back off of his campaign promise which was to have Medicare negotiate directly with the pharmaceutical companies for prices. That was the howitzer of all of this and he decided not to fire it. And so it's significant that after this was announced the stock prices of the pharmaceutical companies actually went up.

BAIER: Yes. So speaking of pharmaceutical companies, part of this, the HHS secretary said you had to adjust what's in ads. Take a listen.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

ALEX AZAR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY: Think about all of the time that everybody spends watching drug company ads on TV and how much information companies are required to put in them. If we want to have a real market for drugs, why not have them disclose their prices in the ads, too?

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BAIER: So basically the HHS secretary saying transparency on pricing for drug companies.

MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, ""THE FEDERALIST"": Yes, but to do that you would have to enact new regulations which I think a lot of the rest of the plan was about deregulating or streamlining how these drugs make it to the marketplace.

To the point about the stock market showing that -- it wasn't just drug companies but also the pharmacy benefit managers, their stocks also went up. I think that what was really interesting about the plan was that it does get more generics into the marketplace. That's really key. That's key for lowering the prices and its' the most substantial thing. The rest seems to be more about sharing among the different groups, who gets to get all this money? So it's also true if you're going to pass something like this you need Democratic support. It is going to be less robust than it was talked about, but I think it does have a change to get pretty big Democratic support.

BAIER: There are some levers, though, at HHS, that they can do outside of Congress. There's a lot of power there.

STEVE HAYES, EDITOR IN CHIEF, ""THE WEEKLY STANDARD"": Sure. HHS has a lot of power. That's why the president's announcements, these announcements are necessarily broad. You listed the goals. A lot will depend on how they roll it out and what the actual details look like. But I think on the matter of recruiting Democrats, it seems to me what the president did was take a step away, as Karen points out, from his campaign rhetoric. This is a less populist plan. It's something more in line with what a traditional Republican president might offer. And I think that will make it less attractive to Democrats in Congress if this in fact has a big push forward because it's not as government centric.

BAIER: Let's turn to the Russian investigation, specifically Cohen, part. Michael Cohen, the president's attorney has this contract with AT&T. We learned that they hired him January through December, a one-year contract, $50,000 per month limited to providing consulting and advisory services, apparently tied to the Time-Warner deal. The head of AT&T Randall Stephenson coming out telling employees it was a big mistake.

TUMULTY: Yes. And he was the second CEO to apologize for having hired Michael Cohen, the other being the head of Novartis, the drug company. It's not that any of this is illegal. In fact it's very much business as usual in Washington. It's just the influence industry is there. It's just new players in it. But is unseemly. These are the kind of deals that corporations hate to have put out in the open.

BAIER: Steve?

HAYES: Then they shouldn't do them, honestly. If they don't want to be exposed, don't do it. Look, this cuts against --

BAIER: But they are living in the swamp.

HAYES: Of course they want to make their best arguments. If they can pay somebody to make their best arguments for them, they'll do that.

This cuts against the heart of President Trump's campaign message. He was going to drain the swamp. This is the swamp. It's the swamp only swampier. I think that's why this is a political problem for the president. For the people who supported the president because they thought I am sick of Washington, D.C. I don't like the way that Washington operates. Everybody is scratching everybody's backs. It's payoffs here, it's kickbacks there. That's basically what this is.

BAIER: I want to rewind. This started with a lot of focus on the Russian oligarch tied to one of the companies. The company has denied that he was funding it for the money that made it to Cohen. We don't know that Mueller has, but what about where that Russia part of it stands and what we know about it?

HEMINGWAY: First off, I think it's worth remembering that the reason why this is even being discussed is because there was a leak by government officials of sensitive information. I don't know if that came from the Special Counsel, someone at the Treasury Department, somewhere else. That's a criminal leak. It's really inappropriate. And there has been a big problem with leaks from various investigations and it should be taken seriously.

And the problem with these amounts really is that the size and scope of government is so big. And if you want to drain the swamp, you have to deal with the size and scope of government. As long as it's this big, people are going to play this game. And the way that everyone is acting like totally surprised that this is happening, it's a little bit of silly naivete.

As for the trying to link to this to the Russian investigation, I think it's interesting that this attorney, Avenatti was trying to link it to Russia. That suggests that this information is part of this larger message about Russia. I don't think that case was actually made well except Russia is a country in the world that has global interests and they might have distant ties to some of these companies they're funding.

BAIER: What about the Nunes part and what they are not getting out of the DOJ as of yet, Karen?

TUMULTY: Well, at this point, it's been interesting that the White House has sided, and the Department of Justice are on the same side of this one. We haven't seen them in that position that often. So the Hill is going to continue to push, the Republicans on the Hill are going to continue to push for this source to be revealed. And the question really I think is going to be whether once the president understands that this source is also somebody who has been cooperating with the Mueller investigation, whether we are going to continue to see this united front.

HEMINGWAY: And I think that's what was so interesting about this Department of Justice leak to the ""Washington Post."" By their own admission what they are saying is they have a top secret source who provides information to the CIA and the FBI who was getting information from the Trump campaign to develop this Russian story. That's a huge story. I don't know why the Department of Justice leaked that to the ""Washington Post."" But that suggests also that it doesn't even matter really who the particular person is. But this is a new layer, a new piece of information that is definitely going to come out one way or other. And I can't imagine they are going to be very successful at keeping this new development a secret.

BAIER: Steve?

HAYES: You often hear the argument that we can't provide more information either to Congressional oversight committees or to the public because it would jeopardize the investigation. It would expose a source, what have you. And we just don't know enough at this point to know whether that's the case in this particular instance. But it is interesting. There have been leaks on both side of this. There have been obvious government leaks, but there have been leaks, and part of the reason that we know more about the nature of the original leak is because there have been counter-leaks. So it seems to me that if you're upset about leaks you've got to be upset about leaks on both sides.

BAIER: I just really, quite down the row -- how long do you think it takes before Mueller wraps up his probe?

HAYES: It's hard to say. I would say six months.

TUMULTY: I think it's going to depend on how long it takes to negotiate whether the president gets subpoenaed, whether the president goes in and testifies.

BAIER: But past the midterms it seems.

HAYES: He doesn't want it to go past the midterms I don't think. Mueller does not.

BAIER: Yes, but if they're going through this negotiation.

TUMULTY: But once you get too close to the midterms, then you don't want to do that either.

HEMINGWAY: I think there is a lot about the Mueller probe that is interested in saving face for the FBI and it's been difficult to do that. They don't have Russia collusion. The obstruction case is going to be difficult to make. They're moving on to other things. I don't know if it will wrap up soon.

BAIER: You don't know. OK. Next up the lightning round. Pompeo on North Korea, the future of trade, plus winners and losers.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: If he is prepared to fully denuclearize it will require a robust verification program and one that we will undertake with partners around the word which will achieve that outcome in a way that, frankly, no agreement before it has ever set forth. A big undertaking for sure but one that Chairman Kim and I have the opportunity to have a good, sound discussion on so that I think we have a pretty good understanding between our two countries about what the shared objectives are.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BAIER: Secretary Mike Pompeo, secretary of state talking about the upcoming meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore on June 12th. We'll star there with the lightning round. Steve, it seems like they are laying the ground work. How detailed it has already gotten we really couldn't get a sense from Pompeo today.

HAYES: We couldn't, but I think it's fair to say the conversations have been ongoing for some time and have to be at some semi-advanced stage for Mike Pompeo to even be giving a press conference about this. I was heartened by what Mike Pompeo said. I think he is mindful of the history here. I think John Bolton is mindful of the history here. And I hope that when President Trump who has been much more optimistic, I would say unrealistically optimistic, at least so far, goes and sits across the table from Kim Jong-un, he has Mike Pompeo on one side and John Bolton on the other.

BAIER: Karen?

TUMULTY: I agree the phrase we hear most often from Secretary Pompeo lips is ""eyes wide open."" They know that these things have happened before, that the North Korea have not followed through on their promises. And as always with these negotiations, they have to know not only what they want but what they will walk away from the table over.

BAIER: Mollie?

HEMINGWAY: It does seem like everyone is willing to put everything on the table, though. There could be a treaty on the Korean Peninsula, that we could have normalized relation with North Korea. They could have denuclearization. Everyone does seem to be appropriately cautious, which is good, but the pace at which this is going is pretty stunningly fast.

BAIER: Very fast. Very fast. OK, here is the president on NAFTA negotiations.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: NAFTA has been a terrible deal. We are renegotiating it now. We'll see what happens. Mexico and Canada, they don't like to lose the golden goose. But I'm representing the United States. I'm not representing Mexico and I'm not representing Canada.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BAIER: Obviously dealing with a lot of trade issues. China, trying to negotiation that as well. I am told the NAFTA negotiations are sort of coming towards the end. We may get a resolution one way or another soon.

HEMINGWAY: I think they want to wrap things up. And the thing that's interesting, even, is that at one point Trump was talking about just doing bilateral arrangements with everybody. That there could be a group agreement is good news for all of them.

BAIER: Karen?

TUMULTY: NAFTA was not a terrible deal. NAFTA created winners and it created losers. And there are a lot of parts of the country where they are very, very nervous about how this turns out, including places like Texas.

BAIER: Steve?

HAYES: They have lots of agricultural interests, lots of farmers have a keen interest in what happened with NAFTA. The interesting thing to me will be to see whether President Trump after a lot of tough talk ends up delivering a tough deal, a tough renegotiation, or if he steps back a little bit.

BAIER: And did you know, that story we did earlier, the almond producers around the world. I just like this stat. The U.S. produces 80 percent of the almonds in the world. That's nuts. That's nuts. That is nuts.

(LAUGHTER)

BAIER: That's very good. Very good. Dad humor. OK. Winners and losers. Winner first, Mollie.

HEMINGWAY: Obvious, but Donald Trump had a really good week. His job approval is at a 12 month high. The right track, wrong track metric is trending in his direction. Obviously it was getting out of the Iran deal, the situation in North Korea is great, getting the three freed hostages home, setting a date for the summit with North Korea, and just generally the discussion about the Mueller probe I think is trending in a way that is very favorable for Donald Trump.

BAIER: Loser?

HEMINGWAY: Barack Obama likewise had a very bad week which is also pretty obvious. But there is something about the Trump administration just slowly, or quickly, actually, rolling back all of the signature accomplishments of the Obama administration, including this week what had to have hurt quite a bit for Obama, which was getting out of the Iran deal that he put so much work into.

BAIER: Which we saw a very detailed response from the former president when that happened. Karen, winner, then loser?

TUMULTY: Winner, Mitch McConnell who sent his mine sweepers into West Virginia and knocked Don Blankenship right out of that race. That potentially could have cost the Republicans any opportunity of winning that seat.

BAIER: I would also say winner, the person who tweeted in his team, nice try.

(LAUGHTER)

TUMULTY: Thanks for playing. And then my loser, all those companies that hired Michael Cohen for his expertise on accounting, health care policy, telecommunications, and whatever else he doesn't have any expertise on.

BAIER: We'll see where that goes. Steve, winner, then loser?

HAYES: Winner, I have two winners, actually. My first winner is Jonah Goldberg, a fellow panelist whose book ""Suicide of the West"" spent its second week on the ""New York Times"" bestseller list. I've read it, terrific book. And my second winner is you, Bret. You have a book coming out on Tuesday. I have not read it. I don't have a copy. I have been bugging you for a copy.

BAIER: Come back to the office. I just got them in.

HAYES: I am here to get one. And that's on Tuesday. Eager to read it.

My loser is John Kerry who has been spending his time lately trying to save the Iran deal that the Trump administration just pulled out and basically doing the bidding of the world's largest state sponsor of terror with Europe, and I think it's a disgrace.

BAIER: Do you think that the Iranians are going to come to the table over this 180 days to renegotiate?

HILTON: We'll see. Remember, their threat was that they were going to immediately pull out of this deal. And for proponents of the deal, the deal is so tough would want out of it right away. Well, they are choosing to stay in at least so far.

BAIER: OK. And I didn't even put him up to the winner thing.

HAYES: You did not. On my own.

BAIER: Thank you very much. When we come back, ""Notable Quotables.""

BAIER: Finally tonight, ""Notable Quotables.""

",148440,"President Trump takes questions about three Americans being released from North Korea, traveling home with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who was in North Korea finalizing plans for the Donald Trump/Kim Jong-Un summit. President Trump announced yesterday the United States will pull out of the Iran nuclear agreement, and Saudi Arabia's foreign minister issues a sobering warning to Iran if they Iran restart their nuclear program. President Trump is threatening to pull credentials of what he calls the corrupt media, raising serious questions over whether this mirrors the behavior a dictator.

[13:30:00] MAX BOOT, CNN GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST: While it's great we're talking, Kim Jong-Un has not made any kind of irreversible concessions to the United States. It's great that he's releasing these three hostages. But remember, he took the hostages to release them later on to get rewarded for it so this is not a huge breakthrough.

WOLF BLITZER, CNN HOST: Do you think something substantive, dramatic, important will emerge from this summit meeting between the president and Kim Jong-Un?

BOOT: I certainly think they will announce something important and that Donald Trump will claim it's the greatest deal ever and it will have the word ""denuclearization"" in it. The issue is, once you dig down, are they going to verifiably give up their nuclear arsenal? I have a lot of questions about that. And Trump just exited from the Iran nuclear deal, so he's setting himself a high benchmark for the kind of deal he will accept from North Korea. It has to be stronger than the Iranian nuclear deal.

BLITZER: He does seem, though, the president, whether you agree or disagree with his policies, to be dominating the world stage right now. If you look at not just North Korea or Iran, but in Syria, Paris Climate Accords, all sorts of international issues. He's really dominating what's going on.

BOOT: Yes. I think he's achieving what he wants, which he wants to be the center of attention and he is. The question is, is it a wise idea to be juggling so many crises at the same time? Remember, he's renegotiating NAFTA, negotiating with China, he's negotiating with North Korea, and now with Iran and our European partners about the Iranian nuclear program. That is a lot of stuff for even a well- functioning White House, with a veteran chief executive to handle. And I just don't know if this White House with Donald Trump and the fact that they still don't have a lot of appointees in place, can they handle these multiple crises at the same time?

BLITZER: And there are multiple crises, indeed.

Max Boot, thank you very much for joining us.

BOOT: Thank you. BLITZER: Coming up, the global fallout. Saudi Arabia's foreign minister issues a sobering warning to Iran. We're going to ask him if Iran restarts their nuclear program, what will the Saudis do? My exclusive interview with Adel al-Jubeir, that's next.

Plus, the president threatens to pull credentials of what he calls the corrupt media, raising serious questions over whether this mirrors the behavior, not of a president of the United States, but of a dictator. We'll have a serious analysis of that when we come back.

[13:36:43] BLITZER: President Trump's decision to walk away from the Iran nuclear deal was not unexpected, but has still been met with deep concern around the globe from those who made the deal. Former President Obama called the decision misguided, while former Vice President Joe Biden called it a profound mistake. Key allies that urged President Trump to stay in the deal, France's Emmanuel Macron, the U.K.'s Theresa May and Germany's Angela Merkel, Adel al-Jubeir all said they felt regret and concern over the decision in washington.

Joining us now from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia's foreign minister.

Foreign Minister, thanks so much for joining us.

Why do you, the Saudi government, support President Trump's decision?

ADEL AL-JUBEIR, SAUDI ARABIAN FOREIGN MINISTER: We believe that the nuclear deal was flawed. We believe that the sunset clause should be eliminated and the inspections should be tightened. It does not deal with Iran's ballistic missile program or Iran's support of terrorism and interference with countries in the region.

BLITZER: If Iran now restarts its nuclear weapons program, will Saudi Arabia build a bomb itself?

AL-JUBEIR: I believe if Iran restarts its enrichment program beyond what it has right now, that should trigger the provisions and cause all the other countries to abandon the deal and reimpose sanctions on Iran.

BLITZER: What will Saudi Arabia do?

AL-JUBEIR: Whatever it takes to protect our people. If Iran acquires nuclear capability, we will do everything we can to do the same.

BLITZER: You will acquire nuclear capability yourself?

AL-JUBEIR: That's what we mean.

BLITZER: What is your message to the Iranian leadership right now, Foreign Minister?

AL-JUBEIR: Our message to the Iran leadership is the policies of the past have to end. You cannot seek to dominate the region and seek to acquire nuclear programs. You must abide by international law, cease supporting terrorism. Cease providing ballistic missiles to terrorist organizations.

BLITZER: Do you believe, as the international atomic energy agency does, and others, the Europeans, for example, the Russians, the Chinese, that Iran has been fully complying with the terms of the 2015 nuclear deal?

AL-JUBEIR: The agreement is flawed, because by 2025, it allows Iran the ability to have unlimited enrichment capability, where they could have enough uranium for a nuclear weapon within a week. That's not acceptable. That's one. Two, the inspections need to be broadened. It's limited to the declared sites. It has to be 24/7, anywhere, any time.

BLITZER: Did the Trump administration speak with the Saudi leadership before announcing the decision by the president yesterday?

AL-JUBEIR: The Trump administration talked to allies and gave them heads up in terms of the timing, but not the content of the announcement.

BLITZER: Not the specific announcement. Were you surprised?

AL-JUBEIR: No. Because I believe it was the right thing to do. I believe that no agreement is better than a flawed agreement. Any future agreement has to include Iran's violations oh of the U.N. resolutions with regard to ballistic missiles and Iran's support for terrorism and interference in the affairs of other countries. Otherwise, that's the only way to stop Iran.

[13:40:11] BLITZER: Why not stay in the deal, Foreign Minister, and work a separate supplemental agreement on Iran's, for example, ballistic missile program, its actions destabilizing in the region? Why not try to expand the deal?

AL-JUBEIR: The deal was flawed. I believe the president tried to work with the other P5 countries to improve the deal and fix it and to deal with the issue of ballistic missiles and with the issue of Iran's support of terrorism and terrorist activities in the region. But they weren't able to reach an agreement that was satisfactory that would force Iran to change its behavior.

BLITZER: As you know, as a result of President Trump's decision, Iran is now, when it comes to this nuclear deal, on the same page as the Europeans, China and Russia. Are you comfortable with that situation?

AL-JUBEIR: As the European countries, France and Germany and the U.K., have made it clear that the issue of Iran's ballistic missiles and the issue of Iran's support for terrorism and interference in the affairs of the countries of the region must be dealt with. So they agree Iran has to be held accountable for this, and looking for ways to fix this agreement. So, yes, we're comfortable that the sanctions will be reimposed. We support the U.S. position. Our allies in the United Arab Emirates in Jordan and Egypt support this. The Arab League supports it. The secretary-general of the Organization of Islamic Countries supports it.

BLITZER: The Israelis clearly support it, as well. The Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu.

The Turkish President Erdogan says a crisis could be coming to the region because of this decision by President Trump. Do you have some fears that there could be an escalation of fighting, for example, in various parts of the Middle East as a result of this decision?

AL-JUBEIR: I hope not. But keep in mind, Wolf, that the crisis in the region began with the revolution in Iran in 1979. Iran has been on a rampage ever since. Iran has been supporting terrorism. Iran has been creating groups like Hezbollah and the Houthis. Iran has been interfering in the affairs of other countries. So Iran has been a source of conflict in this region. The fact that Iran is now going to be held accountable for any actions it takes, and the fact that sanction also be reimposed should be a strong and powerful message to the Iranian regime it must change its behavior.

BLITZER: I know there was another missile attack in Riyadh today. What can you tell us?

AL-JUBEIR: There were two missiles intercepted with Iraq, which brings the total of 130 missiles launched. These missiles are Iranian manufactured, and delivered to the Houthis. Such behavior is unacceptable. It violates U.N. resolutions with regards to ballistic missiles. And the Iranians must be held accountable for this.

BLITZER: So what does that mean, held accountable?

AL-JUBEIR: We will find the right way and at the right time to respond to this.

BLITZER: Including military action?

AL-JUBEIR: We will make -- we are trying to avoid at all costs direct military action with Iran, but Iran's behavior such as this cannot continue. This amounts to a declaration of war. When somebody provides missiles to a terrorist group that lobs missiles at your city and civilians indiscriminately, what do you call it, a friendly act? Of course not.

BLITZER: Foreign Minister, thanks so much for joining us.

AL-JUBEIR: Thank you.

BLITZER: Up next, fresh threats to the First Amendment. President Trump suggests removing press credentials until he gets the news coverage he likes.

[13:48:29] BLITZER: The president of the United States is floating the idea of taking away media credentials until he gets news coverage he likes. In his latest attack against the First Amendment, the president writes, quote, ""The fake news is working overtime. Just reported that despite the tremendous success we are having with the economy and all things else, 91 percent of the network news about me is negative, fake. Why do we work so hard in working with the media when it is corrupt? Take away credentials?"" that's a question mark, take away credentials? I should say, closed quotes.

I want to bring in our senior media correspondent, the host of ""RELIABLE SOURCES,"" Brian Stelter, with us. Also with us, the president of the White House Correspondents' Association, Margaret Talev, the White House correspondent for ""Bloomberg News,"" also a CNN contributor.

Margaret, you released a statement, as the head of the White House Correspondents' Association. Let me read it to our viewers: ""Some may excuse the president's inflammatory rhetoric about the media, but just because the president does not like the news coverage does not make it fake. A free press must be able to report on the good, the bad, the momentous, and the mundane without fear or favor. And the president preventing a free and independent press from covering the workings of our republic would be an unconscionable assault on the First Amendment.""

Walk us through what's going on right now, Margaret. Walk us through the statement you just released.

[13:49:53] MARGARET TALEV, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Thanks, Wolf. What the president conveyed today in his tweet really goes beyond what's appropriate. It's a longstanding tradition for politicians who either don't like critical coverage or are trying to distract from a complicated situation to blame the press. Everyone acknowledges that. We all want to focus on doing our jobs, but there are certain sort of lines, boundaries, that need to be respected.

And actually threatening to restrict coverage and prevent people from getting information is one of those lines. So we thought it was really important to put out a firm statement and call that out. I want to tell you also over the course of the last several hours, I've been in touch on a regular basis with the White House and White House officials about coordinating coverage for a really important event, which is the return of these Americans held in North Korea later tonight.

And so the president has used this rhetoric for a long time and often the association doesn't get involved in responding to rhetoric because it's just important that we focus on doing our jobs but we felt that it was important to call this out as something that was not acceptable.

BLITZER: Certainly outrageous to think that they're going to take away press credentials for working White House reporters, for example, simply because the coverage is negative.

You know, Brian, this isn't the first time the president has mentioned taking away press credentials. Listen to this.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The ""New York Times"" is totally dishonest. Totally dishonest. ""The Washington Post"" gotten a little bit better lately. I took away their press credentials. I should do it with the times.""

It's frankly disgusting the way the press is able to write whatever they want to write. And people should look into it.

The press has become so dishonest that if we don't talk about it, we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people.

See, I know when I should get good and when I should get bad. And sometimes I'll say, wow, that's going to be a great story and I'll get killed.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BLITZER: How serious should we take this threat from the president to yank the press credentials of reporters?

BRIAN STELTER, CNN SENIOR MEDIA CORRESPONDENT & CNN HOST, ""RELIABLE SOURCES"": The way he's talking, it's undemocratic. This is the way dictators operate, not how democratic leaders operate. But it is just talk. It is just the president venting, bloviating, complaining about the coverage he doesn't like. We do see that frequently from him. It's important to recognize there's no actual plan in place to do this. He's musing about this, he's done that privately, and now publicly. If you're even from an obscure -- outlet or partisan blog, they'll still give you credentials for the day. He sends signals by his media attacks and they use the president's rhetoric to condemn and hurt the press all around the world. It's still troubling.

BLITZER: Margaret, the difference between fake news and negative news is very different. The president doesn't like negative news and he brands all of that, even if it's honest and fair, as fake.

STELTER: Yes.

TALEV: And it's a rhetorical tool that he's used. News is news. Facts are facts, and it's our job to report those facts without fear or favor when the news reflects positively on the president's initiatives, that's information the American public should have, when the news is critical and points out nuances, that's also important information for the American public to have. We're here to do our job and we'll continue to do so.

Again, I and most of our colleagues are trying to cover what's happening with North Korea, with Iran, what's happening with Gina Haspel's hearings. There are certain boundaries of what's important. On the ground, and just here at the White House, the correspondent and the White House are actually working on getting good, fulsome coverage tonight so the American public can understand what's happening with the Americans coming home.

STELTER: If I can just mention, he does have a history of this. That's why it's notable. During the campaign, the president did take away credentials from eight news outlets. That's why it is concerning he's talking about it again. When I interviewed him during the campaign, he promised he would not kick people out of the White House about reporting. If he were to actually act on this, it would be a promise broken.

BLITZER: The problem is it gives ammunition to despots in other countries to do this. That's a worrisome development as well.

(CROSSTALK)

BLITZER: We'll continue to monitor this. Very important.

Margaret, Brian, guys, thanks very much.

STELTER: Thank you.

TALEV: Thank you.

[13:55:09] BLITZER: And this just coming in. We're seeing our first pictures of Secretary of State Pompeo's trip to North Korea. Here he is being greeted by North Korean officials. The new secretary of state was there working on details for the upcoming summit between President Trump and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong un. The Secretary Pompeo is now flying back to the United States, and with him aboard the aircraft are the three American detainees just released by North Korea earlier in the day.

Iraqis voted on Saturday in the country's first parliamentary elections since the toppling of ISIS, with the ballot conducted largely free of violence.

The outcome is considered vital to shoring up peace and rebuilding the war-battered nation after years of conflict.

Prime Minister Haider Al Abadi, who is aiming to retain his job after declaring victory over ISIS in December, played up his track record, after voting in Baghdad.

""Iraq is strong and unified after defeating terror,"" he said. ""The elections will determine Iraq's future.""

Ahead of the vote, ISIS threatened to target the event and officials warned that ballot stations could be hit.

An unconfirmed shooting reportedly killed members of the security forces south of the ethnically diverse oil-rich northern city of Kirkuk, though there was no immediate claim of responsibility or any apparent link to the election.

But there were concerns about voter turnout, with many citizens saying they lacked confidence in the candidates to do what was needed to improve people's prospects.

There were also complaints that a curfew that barred cars and buses from the streets of major urban centres had made it difficult for some voters to reach their designated polling station.

___

After a midday appeal from the office of Ayatollah Ali Al Sistani, Iraq's top Shiite cleric, urging citizens to vote, Mr Al Abadi also lifted the traffic curfew.

A spokesman for Mr Al Sistani in the religious city of Karbala said participation was necessary ""to prevent the arrival of a corrupt parliament"".

Mr Al Abadi came to power in September 2014 after then premier Nouri Al Maliki resigned in disgrace because of the rise of ISIS months earlier.

Ahmed Jadallah / Reuters</figure>

The incumbent is favoured among analysts to remain prime minister but Mr Al Maliki, who held the job for eight years, was attempting to usurp him.

Also in the running was Hadi Al Ameri, a longtime Shiite militia leader with a controversial past and particularly close ties to Iran. Results are expected on Monday, electoral officials said.

Iraq's three main ethnic and religious groups – the majority Shiite Arabs and minority Sunni Arabs and Kurds – have been at odds for decades. Sectarian divisions remain deep despite all three groups joining forces in 2014 to fight ISIS, which had seized large areas of northern and western Iraq and at one point seemed poised to move on Baghdad.

Mr Al Sistani, who in 2014 criticised Mr Al Maliki for security failures that helped ISIS storm the country, has repeatedly encouraged Iraqis to vote into power a new political class to combat corruption, in remarks considered to be a renewed attack on the former prime minister.

The poll came at a time when tensions are surging between Iran and the United States after President Donald Trump pulled out of a 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran this week. His withdrawal has raised fears of a renewed power struggle in Iraq between Tehran and Washington and the potential for a new outbreak of conflict in the Middle East.

Saudi Arabia, which in 2016 reopened its embassy in Baghdad and has seen ties with Iraq improve since, also has a lot at stake. Mr Al Abadi has maintained a middle ground approach to Iraq's foreign policy. However if Mr Ameri's Fateh bloc or Mr Al Maliki's State of Law coalition increase their number of seats in parliament, Baghdad could swing closer to Tehran.

Roughly 24.5 million Iraqi voters were eligible to cast ballots in a poll in which the dominant Shiite powerbrokers were split, the Kurds in disarray and the Sunnis sidelined. Overall, just under 7,000 candidates were standing, seeking a place in the 329-seat parliament in Baghdad.

Over 15 blood-sodden years since the US-led ousting of Saddam Hussein, disillusionment is widespread and politics is dominated by old faces from an elite seen as mired in corruption and sectarianism.

No attacks on polling stations were reported. In comparison, Iraq's elections in 2010 were marred by widespread violence and insecurity, with dozens of people killed on polling day by roadside bombs, rocket and mortar attacks in Baghdad, Tikrit, Baquba, Samarra, Mosul and Fallujah.

On Saturday, at a polling station in the majority Shiite Baghdad district of Karrada, 74-year-old Sami Wadi appealed for change ""to save the country"".

""I call on all Iraqis to participate in the elections to prevent those who have controlled the nation since 2003 from staying in power,"" the retiree said.

In Mosul, Iraq's second city and the former ISIS bastion that now lies in ruins after the nine-month battle to oust the group, residents spoke of struggling to put their lives back together.

""I am voting for security and the economy to stabilise and for a better future,"" said 26-year-old labourer Ali Fahmi.

But others saw little point in backing familiar faces who many say have failed to make good on campaign promises. ""Each election is the same - nothing ever changes,"" said Mounes Fauzi, a 27-year-old barber from Baghdad who did not bother to vote.

Ranj Alaaldin, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution suggested that disillusionment was a likely factor in Saturday's turn out.

""There isn't anything particularly refreshing,"" he told The National. ""The usual players that have dominated the political scene are likely to continue their corrupted, dysfunctional rule of the country. That isn't lost on Iraqis and they have clearly sent a strong message to the political class.""

"Will Somalia's President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed experience a significant leadership disruption before 1 September 2018?
",56449,"The Islamist election victories in Egypt and Tunisia have not necessarily been greeted with enthusiasm in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf, writes Alain GreshDubai's chief of police, General Dahi Khalfan Al-Tamim, claims that the Muslim Brotherhood is ""a small group that has strayed from the true path"". He also says that the revolution in Egypt ""would not have been possible without Iran's support and is the prelude to a new Sykes-Picot agreement"" and that Mohamed Morsi's election as president of Egypt was ""an unfortunate choice"". Like many leading figures in the Arab world, Al-Tamim uses twitter, where he has said that ""if the Muslim Brotherhood threatens the Gulf's security, the blood that flows will drown it."" 

Throughout this summer, Al-Tamim criticised the Brotherhood, which he calls ""a sinful gang whose demise is drawing near"", and he has called for its assets and bank accounts to be frozen. The authorities in the UAE, of which Dubai is a part, have brought around 60 of the Brothers to court, charged with plotting against the regime. The pan-Arab newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat belongs to Saudi Crown Prince Salman's family. Despite its reputation in the West, it has almost no autonomy in matters of Arab politics. The day after Morsi's swearing-in on 30 June, its editor, Abdel-Rahman Al-Rashed, asked various questions, really those of the ruling Al-Saud family. Would Egypt's new head of state fight terrorism and oppose Al-Qaeda? Would he continue Egypt's mediating role over Palestine? Would he genuinely support the Syrian opposition, given his opposition to any foreign military intervention? Would he back Jordan's King Abdullah against the challenge from the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood? Al-Rashed asked ""as Iran has long been a strong ally of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, will the new president decide to resume relations with Tehran under the pretext that Iran has embassies and ambassadors in the Gulf states? Will he remain silent about Iran's ideological and religious activities that have intensified ever since the ousting of Mubarak, as seen in Tehran's support for local groups and attempts to spread Shia ideology among some Egyptian circles? This is something Al-Azhar [Sunni Islam's leading institution based in Cairo] has already criticised, warning that Egypt could be threatened with sectarian conflict."" By September, Al-Rashed was condemning Cairo's willingness to include Tehran (along with Riyadh and Ankara) in a group formed to find a solution to the Syrian crisis. The Saudi foreign minister boycotted a meeting of this group in Cairo on 17 September. These warnings, and many others in the Gulf press, have attracted little attention in the West, perhaps because they run counter to the prevailing view: that there is a broad alliance uniting the emirs of the Gulf and the Islamist movements in their wish to impose strict religious order and Sharia, as though a shared conservative vision of Islam superseded political considerations and diplomatic rivalries, national differences and divergent strategies.  NO FORMAL AGREEMENT: There are historical precedents for such a view, even if they are more a matter of politics than religion. In the 1950s and 1960s, thousands of members of the Muslim Brotherhood who had been persecuted in Egypt, Syria, Algeria and Iraq, settled in the Gulf, especially Saudi Arabia. But as an Egyptian with links to the Brotherhood points out, ""there wasn't a formal agreement. The organisation had been dismantled and had no leadership structure. But it's true that the activists who settled in Saudi Arabia provided their new homeland with thousands of members who contributed to the fight against Arab nationalism, especially against the then Egyptian president Gamal Abdel-Nasser and against the left.""  The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in December 1980 gave the alliance a fresh impetus in the name of the fight against communism. Thousands of volunteers flocked to fight the Red Army, mobilised by the different Islamist groups including Muslim Brotherhood networks (though the Egyptian branch mostly stayed in reserve) supported by the United States and CIA and financed by the Gulf's oil monarchies.  Al-Qaeda came out of this mobilisation to support Afghan ""freedom fighters"".  The seductive hypothesis that the Arab Spring represents the third stage of this holy alliance obscures more complex realities of the post-Cold War era. The first is the split between the Brotherhood and the Saudi monarchy in the early 1990s after the invasion of Kuwait. Saudi's then minister of the interior, the powerful Prince Nayef, wrote in the Kuwaiti daily Al-Siyasa in 2002 that ""the Muslim Brotherhood is the cause of most of the Arab world's problems and it has done vast amounts of damage in Saudi Arabia. We have given this group too much support… The Muslim Brotherhood has destroyed the Arab world.""  He reminded readers that during the Gulf crisis of 1990-91 he had received a delegation that included Rachid Al-Ghannouchi, the current president of the Tunisian Al-Nahda Party, Hassan Al-Tourabi (Sudan), Abdel-Majid Al-Zindani (Yemen) and Necmettin Erbakan (Turkey), all of them linked to the Muslim Brotherhood. ""We asked them whether they would accept the attack on Kuwait. They said they [had come] to collect opinions. But when they arrived in Iraq they surprised us by issuing statements backing Iraq's occupation of Kuwait,"" he wrote.The prince did not mention another reason for his anger, one shared by other emirs in the region, which was that the establishment of the Brotherhood in the Gulf states and its involvement in protests had affected the kingdom since the first Gulf War. The Brotherhood's political vision — an Islamic state, but a democratically elected one — diverges from that of Saudi Arabia, which is founded on unquestioning loyalty to the royal family. The latter has preferred to finance Salafist movements instead, which are both divided and numerous, and it has been reassured by their refusal to interfere politically and their support for the powers that be, including the royal family and the Mubarak regime in Egypt.  The divide between Riyadh and the Brotherhood widened in the 2000s, when the Brotherhood joined, through Hamas, the ""Axis of Resistance"" in the region, along with Iran, Syria and Lebanon's Hizbullah.  NEW CARDS OF THE ARAB SPRING: The Arab revolutions introduced fresh cards into this scenario. Saudi Arabia and the emirates opposed the uprisings. They saw the successful experiments conducted by the Brotherhood in Egypt and Tunisia as anything but good news. Saudi Arabia's Wahhabi leaders, who had excellent relations with Hosni Mubarak and welcomed former Tunisian president Zein Al-Abidine bin Ali after he fled from Tunisia, refusing to extradite him at the request of Tunisia's new leaders, resented the Brothers for toppling these dictators and the United States for abandoning them.  The Saudi monarchy set itself up as the centre of the counter-revolution and crushed the revolt in Bahrain in March 2011. Riyadh also supported Jordan's King Abdullah against protests in Amman, in which the Brotherhood took an active part.  Yet, President Morsi's first foreign visit on 11 July 2012 was to Saudi Arabia, not out of ""Islamist"" solidarity, but for the sake of realpolitik. Egypt desperately needs Saudi money, and it has received $1.5 billion and has been promised a further $2.5 billion. More than 1.5 million Egyptians work in Saudi Arabia, and the money they send home boosts Egypt's balance of payments. Moreover, however much Saudi Arabia might wish to, it cannot cut itself off from Egypt, the most important country in the Middle East.  ""Morsi's visit didn't solve all the problems,"" an Egyptian diplomat has said, and many sources of tension remain, including the treatment of Egyptians in Saudi Arabia and the fate of Saudi investments in Egypt. In April, the Saudi ambassador to Cairo was recalled after demonstrations against the arrest in Saudi Arabia of Ahmed Al-Gizawi, a lawyer accused of drug possession. In August, Essam Al-Erian, a senior leader of the Brotherhood who has become a presidential adviser, asked the Saudi ambassador on twitter to ""clarify the crime, penalty and circumstances of the arrest of the Egyptian citizen Naglaa Wafa"", a woman with two children held in the kingdom since 2009 and sentenced to five years in prison and 500 lashes after a financial disagreement with a Saudi prince.  The fate of Saudi investments in Egypt is also a problem. In June 2011, a press release from the wealthy Saudi Prince Walid bin Talal announced that he was ""giving the Egyptian people"" 75 per cent of the 420 square kilometre of farmland he had bought for a bargain price under Mubarak's corrupt regime. This avoided possible trouble with the Egyptian authorities. Other inquiries have been initiated by the Egyptian judiciary that are looking at Saudi interests, even though Cairo and Riyadh are trying to minimise the tensions and Egypt has set up a special bureau to try to settle financial disputes with Saudi Arabia.  SAUDI FEARS: Saudi Arabia is not pleased by Cairo's return to the diplomatic scene after a decade in which Egypt had been largely absent or had been content to follow the Wahhabi lead. Morsi's travels, first to China in a sign that tête-à-têtes with the United States were over and then to Iran, have confirmed Saudi fears.  The Tehran visit won Morsi some credit with the Egyptian public, who were proud of him for having resisted US pressure, although they were barely aware of the Gulf leaders' anti-Iranian and anti-Shia rhetoric. To avoid possible conflict with Saudi Arabia, the Egyptian president had to pull off a tricky balancing act: he spent only a few hours in Tehran, didn't meet Iran's supreme guide as planned, and refused to talk of resuming bilateral diplomatic relations.  After paying homage to Nasser — astonishing, given that Nasser had violently repressed the Brotherhood in the 1950s and 1960s — he called for the departure of President Bashar Al-Assad from Syria, while at the same time rejecting foreign intervention there, which Saudi Arabia has called for.  During his long exile, Al-Ghannouchi, leader of Tunisia's Al-Nahda, which is part of the Brotherhood, lived in London in preference to Riyadh. On a visit to the United States in December 2011, he predicted that the Arab Spring would remove the emirs from the Gulf, and this prompted the Saudi daily Al-Riyadh to ask whether that prediction included the emir of Qatar, a major supporter of Al-Nahda.  Relations between Qatar, a Wahhabi state like Saudi Arabia and one that adheres to the strict form of Islam that predominates throughout the Arabian Peninsula, and the Brotherhood are solid. Qatar believes that in the Brotherhood it has found a conduit for its policies, since Qatar doesn't have a big enough army or enough diplomats or spies to play an active regional role. Its bottomless coffers are its only trump card.  It has made use of the Islamist preacher Sheikh Youssef Al-Qaradawi, who has been in Qatar since the 1970s and whose programme on Al-Jazeera, ""Sharia and Life"", has made him one of the region's most popular preachers. Al-Qaradawi is a religious reference point for the Brotherhood, of which he is a former member, though he maintains his independence and has criticised the sectarianism of the Brotherhood's Egyptian branch.  Qatar, which flirted for a time with Hizbullah, Syria and Iran, while maintaining solid relations with the US, has opted to back the Brotherhood since the Arab Spring. Al-Jazeera, a channel completely funded by Qatar, has lost much of its lustre and some of its best journalists as a result, and it has become a mouthpiece for the Brotherhood in Egypt and, to a lesser extent, in Tunisia.  The emir of Qatar's visit to Egypt this August in the middle of Ramadan and his $2 billion deposit at Egypt's Central Bank to help out the country's treasury is proof of the strength of the ties. But do they amount to a strategic alliance? The recent tensions between Al-Nahda and Qatar, which has become concerned about the movement's inability to stabilise Tunisia, suggest not.  The French leader General de Gaulle used to talk simplistically about the ""the complicated East"", but it can be analysed using the same political concepts as the rest of the world. However, the application of these concepts still has to win acceptance. The branches of the Brotherhood don't follow a secret conductor in Mecca with a score based on the dogmas of Islam. Instead, their strategy often follows each country's national interests, as Morsi's policy over Israel or Gaza shows (a major disappointment to Hamas).  The Salafis' political debut in Egypt and Tunisia brings new challenges in the shape of the rapprochement between Qatar and Saudi Arabia and the threats to Jordan's monarchy. Qatar has moved closer to Saudi Arabia, while remaining distrustful of it, while the Wahhabi Saudi kingdom fears a successful democratic transition in the Arab world, even with the participation of the Brothers. For its part, the Jordanian monarchy is now refusing to coordinate its aid for the Syrian rebels with Qatar, which it suspects of favouring the Brotherhood.  It is hard to understand the regional Islamist landscape when it is viewed through a purely religious lens.  The writer is vice president of Le Monde diplomatique.

He described his meetings with Kim as substantive and said he had offered US economic help to North Korea, which is extremely poor, if the country gives up its nuclear weapons.

Many long-term analysts are sceptical that Kim, who only announced in December that the country's nuclear forces were completed, will give up such a hard-won prize even for extremely generous aid.

The fate of autocrats like Saddam Hussein and Libya's Muammar Gaddafi, who gave up their weapons programmes only to be toppled in western-backed military actions, has been noted in Pyongyang.

Trump's decision to pull out of the nuclear agreement his predecessor Barack Obama forged with Iran may also give Kim pause for thought about the durability of any deal he makes with a US president.

For now, however, Kim appears to be on a diplomatic offensive, offering concessions many thought he would try to use as bargaining chips at the meeting with Trump, including the prisoner release and decommissioning the test site.

",801960,"The complete and irreversible denuclearization of North Korea should be realized in a verifiable way. Whether a road map that stipulates concrete measures and deadlines for that goal can be drawn up will determine the outcome of an upcoming historic meeting.

The first-ever U.S.-North Korea summit is now scheduled to be held on June 12 in Singapore. U.S. President Donald Trump emphasized that he and his counterpart ""will both try to make it a very special moment for world peace.""

Trump once showed an interest in holding the summit in Panmunjom, where a summit of the South and North Korean leaders was held. Holding a U.S.-North Korea summit on the Korean Peninsula would give the impression that the United States has made concessions and given the initiative to North Korea. It can be said that Trump's decision to choose a third-party country by attaching importance to neutrality was wise.

To prepare for the upcoming summit, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited North Korea and held talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who serves as the chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea. The dialogue and confidence-building efforts that have been made between the United States and North Korea can be considered a welcome move.

The fact that three U.S. citizens who had been held in North Korea were released and returned home with Pompeo also seems to have been a key factor for a U.S.-North Korea summit to take place.

Kim expressed expectations to Pompeo over what is set to be a historic meeting. Kim's acceptance of holding a summit in Singapore is a type of decision never made by his father, Kim Jong Il, who held the title of the party's general secretary. Kim Jong Un apparently aims to resolve the long-standing hostile relationship with the United States all at once through top-level face-to-face negotiations.

Abe must liaise with Trump

Both Trump and Kim have set ""denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula"" as the goal of the summit. The problem, though, is that what that means differs for each of them.

The United States intends to make North Korea abandon its ballistic missiles and all of its weapons of mass destruction, including biological and chemical weapons, within a set period. This requires North Korea to make declarations on its nuclear weapons, nuclear materials and related facilities and dismantle them, and for the International Atomic Energy Agency to conduct inspections and monitoring operations.

North Korea is unlikely to comply with these steps easily. There is no doubt that it will take action for denuclearization in stages, and demand such things as the easing of economic sanctions and the guaranteeing of its regime in return each time. It is possible that North Korea will call for the removal of the ""nuclear umbrella"" that the United States provides to South Korea.

Declaring ""denuclearization"" or ""the end of the Korean War"" alone does not mean North Korea's nuclear and missile threats will be removed. It is imperative to draw up a road map for denuclearization and continue applying pressure on North Korea until the country actually implements it. Trump must not rush simply in pursuit of success.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he strongly expects the upcoming summit to be ""an opportunity for moving forward on the nuclear issue, the missile issue and the abduction issue, which, above all, is the most important.""

By having talks with Trump at the summit of the Group of Seven major nations on June 8 and 9, Abe must elaborately coordinate regarding the stances taken by Japan and the United States.

",633233,"IntroductionFor over a decade, North Korea has lived through one upheaval after another. Political unrest, economic troubles and diplomatic isolation combined have put the country into an impoverished and desperate situation. Positive trends appeared to have been emerging in 1999. Events from 2001 onward, however, would take the country in a less positive path in the realm of geopolitics.

Still, throughout 1999, North Korea made all-out national efforts to pull itself back from the brink. As Pyongyang's media put it, ""It is the unswerving will and resolution of our leader to concentrate national efforts on the economy so as to put our country on the path toward an economic power."" As a result, according to reports from a South Korean government think tank, North Korea's grain output in 1999 was estimated at 4.2 million tons, an 8.5 percent increase from that of 1998. This was the highest since floods devastated the North's harvest in 1995. In 1999, North Korea's economy stopped shrinking and recorded 6.2 percent growth, the first positive growth in 10 years.Key political issues in North Korea in the last decade have been focused on its relationship with South Korea. In 1992, an accord was signed stipulating non-aggression, reconciliation, and cooperative exchanges between North and South Korea. Meanwhile, impoverished North Korea has been the recipient of humanitarian aid from South Korea, despite the prevailing hostilities between the two entities.In June 1999, talks began between North and South Korea, in Beijing, over the hopes and plans for reunification of the two factions of the Korean peninsular, and to put into effect the stipulations of the 1992 accord. The major aspects of the accord involved the reunification of estranged families who had been divided by the political fate of the peninsula, reconciliation, cooperation, a climate of entente and the long-term possibility of reunification. It was hoped that this kind of substantive engagement could be realized by separating business from politics, and by emphasizing the shared ideals designated in the 1992 accord.In early 2000, the world saw big steps taken by the two Koreas toward the goal of rapprochement. On April 8, 2000, delegates from both Koreas signed an agreement in Beijing, China announcing that a summit would be held between the top leaders of both Koreas in Pyongyang in mid-June 2000. The agreement on the summit had been the result of mutual efforts by the leaders of the two sides of the peninsula.As early as in 1981, South Korean President Chun Doo-hwan suggested direct talks between South and North Korean leaders, but was rejected by North Korean President Kim Il Sung. In February 1993, South Korean President Kim Young-sam also suggested a summit with Kim Il Sung, and Kim Il Sung accepted the suggestion in June 1994. But the scheduled summit was canceled due to Kim Il Sung's sudden death on July 8, 1994.After taking office in early 1998, South Korean President Kim Dae-jung expressed a desire to meet with North Korea's leader, saying a summit could help end hostilities between the Koreas. Indeed, in the late 1990s, inter-Korean trade had grown, and the number of visitors from the South to the North had increased. In February 1999, in an open letter, the North Korean government proposed to the South Korean authorities that the year 1999 be set as a year for enhancing national reconciliation and unity. It also proposed wide-ranging dialogue between the two governments.On March 17, 2000, delegates of Seoul and Pyongyang met in China in anticipation of the summit between Kim Dae-jung and Kim Jong il. All these contributed to the final decision that the summit between the North and South Korean top leaders be held  in June 2000. From June 13-15, 2000, North Korean leader Kim Jong il and South Korean President Kim Dae-jung met in Pyongyang; it was the first summit of its type since the end of the Korean War in 1950s. The summit had been scheduled to start on June 12, but was postponed one day by Pyongyang for ""technical reasons."" To the world's surprise, Kim Jong il personally greeted Kim Dae-jung at the airport when the South president arrived in Pyongyang for the summit.  After this historic moment, North Korean leader Kim Jong il and South Korean President Kim Dae-jung signed a historic accord called ""North-South Joint Declaration"" at the end of the second day of the three-day summit. With the aim of reducing tension in the divided peninsula and working towards an eventual reunification, the Joint Declaration covered five issues: (1) the North and the South agreed to resolve the country's reunification independently; (2) both sides agreed to work for the reunification in the direction based on the proposal of federation by the North and that of confederation by the South with common elements; (3) both sides agreed to settle the problems of the separated families and long-term prisoners, and exchange of visiting groups of separated families was to start Aug. 15, 2000; (4) the North and the South would promote economic cooperation and cooperation in social, cultural, sports, public health and environmental fields; and (5) both sides agreed to remain in contact to assure that this agreement would be implemented.  The summit was seen as a turning point in the inter-Korean relations. It has been the first formal step in the bilateral efforts for reunification. The agreement reached by the leaders of both Koreas during the summit was far more detailed than those reached by lower-ranking officials in 1972 and 1991. Although the agreement did not mention certain major issues, such as South Korea's concern over the North's nuclear and missile programs and the North's demand for the withdrawal of 37,000 United States (U.S.) troops stationed in the South, the summit -- at the time -- opened the door for future discussions for those issues. The two leaders also agreed that North Korean leader Kim Jong il would pay a return visit to the South in the near future.  On Aug. 15, 2000, a significant move toward reconciliation took place on the Korean Peninsula. Seoul and Pyongyang exchanged 100 people from each side by air for a four-day reunion with family members separated for more than 50 years. The airplane carrying 100 North Koreans flew to Seoul from Pyongyang and returned to Pyongyang with 100 South Koreans one hour later. This was also the first North Korean airplane allowed runway privileges in the South since the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950s. On Aug. 18, the South Korea airplane brought the 100 North Koreans back to Pyongyang and returned with the 100 South Koreans. The exchange of the 200 people was part of the June 15 Joint Declaration reached in Pyongyang. More than 75,000 South Koreans applied for the reunions with their relatives in North Korea, but the number was narrowed down to 100 by computerized lottery, giving priority to those with a direct family relationship, such as parents, spouses and children.  In November, the two Koreas went on the second such exchanges for family reunion. At the time, an estimated 7.6 million South Koreans had relatives in North Korea. About 1.2 million North Koreans escaped to the South during the Korean conflict, with  thousands of South Koreans went to the North.In late January 2001, South and North Korea held the three-day inter-Korean Red Cross talks and reached a six-point agreement on reunions and communication between separated family members. According to the agreement, 300 family members from each side would be allowed to exchange letters on March 15, the first exchange of its kind since the Korean War in 1950s.Another high profile progress in reconciliation of the two Koreas was the plan to re-link the two sides by road and rail. Defense ministers of North and South Korea met in September 2000 for the first time since the Korean War and agreed to seek military cooperation for the cross-border railway. In November of that year, the military officers from both sides met again to hold their first talks on restoring road and railway links across the world's most heavily fortified border. The Korean War had cut off transport links in early 1950s, and the project to reconnect transport includes the main railway from Seoul to Pyongyang and a four-lane highway parallel to it through the demilitarized zone. For a few years, the reconstruction of the inter-Korean railway and highway was under way by both sides in the demilitarized zone. The two sides also agreed to jointly manage the reconstruction and operation of the railroad and highway in the demilitarized zone.Until early 2001, the two Koreas had held four rounds of ministerial level talks aimed at accelerating steps in reconciliation and cooperation. During these talks, the two sides agreed to set up an inter-Korean committee for economic cooperation, and such a committee was established in late December 2000. Senior economic officials from North and South Korea talked about ways to boost economic cooperation, including North Korea's urgent request for electricity supplies from the South to ease its chronic energy shortages. In early January 2001, South Korea delivered a draft agreement on economic cooperation to North Korea, which included the provision of electricity, measures to prevent Imjin River flooding, construction of rail and road links, and the building of an industrial complex in North Korea.Meanwhile, there were signs that North Korea was making progress in changing its image of seclusion, being more open to the outside world. What was most obvious was its desire or interest in economic reforms. In October 2000, just days after North and South Korea agreed to establish a joint economic cooperation committee, the North Korean government replaced the country's finance minister and Central Bank president. Two months later, the trade minister of North Korea was also replaced with someone having expertise in trade with Western countries. The replacement of the top financial and trade officials suggested that North Korea was serious about economic reforms by bringing its financial and trade systems more in line with international norms.In November 2000, officials from the European Union paid a three-day visit to North Korea's capital Pyongyang. During the visit the North Korean officials told them that the country might relax its investment rules by allowing multinational companies full control over any investment in the country.In his New Year's speech for 2001, Kim Jong il called for ""new thinking,"" portraying himself as the Kim Il Sung of the 21st century. One of the most dramatic moves was North Korean leader Kim Jong il's visit to China.In mid-January 2001, Kim Jong il paid a six-day visit to China, most of the time visiting Shanghai, the city at the center of China's economic reform effort. There were reports that he visited Shanghai's stock market as well as huge factories run by foreign corporations. It was reported that Kim was very interested in the economic achievements China had made since its reforms in early 1980s, and Kim's comment after the visit was that China's market reform policies were correct.North Korea's Slide into Greater Isolation; 2001-2006The momentum towards normalization of relations between North Korea and the outside world was slowed with the election of United States (U.S.)  President George W. Bush. Early in his administration President Bush ordered a review of United States policy towards North Korea and the Bush Administration made it clear that improved relations with the United States depended on progress across a broad range of security issues -- including force deployments, nuclear weapons and missiles.The U.S. - North Korea relationship was then dealt a blow with the terrorist attack against the United States on Sept. 11, 2001. In a speech in early 2002 on terrorism and global security, the American leader referred to North Korea as a member of the ""axis of evil,"" along with Iran and Iraq. This designation resulted in retrenchment by North Korea and saber rattling on both sides.As well, there was an awkward tension between South Korea and the United States that grew out of the situation. As noted in this review, South Korea has expressed the desire for eventual reunification with North Korea, in accordance with the sunshine policy of former South Korean President Kim Dae-jung.  At the same time, the South wants to maintain a good relationship with the United States. The American position on North Korea placed South Korea in a difficult situation.In September 2002, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi of Japan held a summit meeting with Kim Jong il. The focus of the meeting was to foster improved relationships between Japan and North Korea. The meeting signaled an interesting drift in Japanese foreign policy towards a view independent of the United States on policy in North Korea.In October 2002, following talks between North Korea's government representatives and United States Special Envoy, James Kelly, North Korea accused the United States of arrogance and high-handedness. The discussions were launched because Japan and South Korea expressed similar desires to ameliorate their relations with North Korea and end diplomatic isolation. In this regard, these discussions embodied the highest level diplomatic contact between North Korea and the United States since United States President, George Bush, referred to North Korea as one third of the ""axis of evil"" as aforementioned.North Korean outrage about the Kelly's handling of the talks was reportedly due to the United States' insistence over missiles programs, human rights matters, and other military issues. North Korea's government stated that it was apparent that the United States was not really interested in a bilateral dialogue but rather, the United States wished to pursue a continued policy of hostility, arrogance and high-handed practices in its relations with North Korea. For its part, the United States Special Envoy, James Kelly, described the discussions as ""frank.""A week later, North Korea admitted it had been developing a clandestine nuclear weapons program. This nuclear weapons endeavor was in contravention of a 1994 accord, which provided for the end of any such weapons programs, in exchange for the construction of two nuclear power reactors. The situation was complicated by the fact that some reports suggest that Pakistan -- a United States ally in the war on terrorism -- may have provided North Korea with equipment used to develop the weapons program.North Korea stated that it was open to discussing the situation with the United States. These discussions would embody another round of high level diplomatic contact between North Korea and the United States. The earlier round of discussions (noted in the paragraph above) were fraught with discord. Meanwhile, the United States insisted that the existence of a North Korean nuclear weapons program should be distinguished from the possible development of a nuclear weapons program in Iraq -- an issue that was gaining global media attention.By November 2002, the United States and a number of its its allies agreed to stop the supply of fuel oil to North Korea. The United States and its allies explained that North Korea's recent admission of an ongoing nuclear weapons program constituted a breach of a 1994 agreement.In a strange twist, however, South Korea then stated that it believed that North Korean's admission of a nuclear weapons program might, in fact, have been an erroneously translated statement. South Korean authorities noted that the interpretation of North Korea's radio transmission of issues regarding a nuclear weapons program may have been flawed. Specifically, South Korean authorities suggest that a verb used in the transmission may not have been clearly understood by monitors. That is to say, rather than stating that North Korea ""has come to have"" military counter-measures, including nuclear weapons, the key phrase was, in fact, that North Korea is simply ""entitled"" to own nuclear weapons. This ironic revelation gained credence when the wording in a new radio transmission was clearly changed to reflect the entitlement of a nuclear weapons program, rather than the actual ongoing development of one. Nevertheless, officials from news networks who cross-checked the South Korean claim of misinterpretation stated that the original translation was correct.Meanwhile, regional experts as well as International Relations specialists noted that North Korea's official media transmissions generally tend to be imbued by sharp rhetoric, even when the North Korean government  may be engaged with foreign entities. In this way, the hostile tone of the North Korean governmental megaphone might not necessarily have reflected the government's actual position on matters of international import. Yet other analysts suggested that North Korea's admission of a nuclear weapons program might have been a step in the direction of diplomacy. By responding to the United States' recent threats, the government in Pyongyang may have been signaling that it was open to discussion. Put simply, by declaring its nuclear weapons program, the government in Pyongyang may have been pushing the United States into some sort of negotiations.By the end of 2002, reports surfaced suggesting that North Korea had re-opened an old nuclear plant, despite strict warnings from both South Korea and the United States. A representative the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), as well as an official from the South Korean government, both reported that seals had been removed from the radiochemical laboratory in Yongbyon, which had been used for nuclear reprocessing. Experts observed that the Yongbyon plant has the facility to extract weapons-grade plutonium from spent fuel rods.For its part, North Korea claimed it had no choice but to resume its nuclear program since fuel oil supplies shipments had been halted in response to the United States' claims that it was in violation of a 1994 agreement. The North Koreans noted that they had to meet the energy needs of the country. The United States responded that the North Koreans were indulging in a circular argument; they also asserted that the re-opening of the old nuclear plant and nuclear program had nothing to do with energy generation.The government of North Korea in Pyongyang stated it was willing to respond favorably to the security concerns of the United States, if a non-aggression treaty could be developed. This willingness again suggested that the North Koreans appeared to want to move in the direction of diplomatic discussions. The Bush administration in the United States, however, refused to negotiate with the North Koreans under these circumstances, although they moved closer in the direction of talks with North Korea. It remained unclear as to how the Bush administration distinguishes bilateral negotiations from talks or discussions.Amidst a climate of political wrangling, two nuclear inspectors from the IAEA arrived in China on the last day of 2002, having been expelled from North Korea. The country's nuclear program was left unmonitored, although IAEA representatives expressed hopes that their inspectors would be allowed to return in due course. In another shocking development, North Korean officials hinted that the country would pull out of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in the near future, as a consequence of threats from the United States. The ""threats"" were thought to refer to a constellation of items, including the use of the term ""axis of evil"" by United States President George W. Bush in early 2002, the reportedly acrimonious bilateral discussions between United States envoy Kelly and North Korean officials, as well as the halt on fuel energy supplies to North Korea.On Jan. 10, 2003, North Korean officials announced the country would withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. In a speech to the United Nations, the North Korean ambassador explained that the decision was indeed a consequence of United States' clearly expressed hostility toward North Korea. Pak Gil-yon, the North Korean ambassador, also referenced the Bush administration's inclusion of North Korea as part of an ""axis of evil"" in early 2002 as evidence of the United States' threatening stance against his country. In addition, he blamed the IAEA for acting as the pawn of the United States, in order to implement a policy hostile to North Korea.The most promising development in regard to the brewing standoff between North Korea and the United States was a January 2003 meeting between North Korean officials and Bill Richardson, the governor of New Mexico. Richardson was the former Energy Secretary and Ambassador to the United Nations under United States President Bill Clinton.In those meetings with Richardson, Deputy United Nations Ambassador, Han Song Ryol, reiterated North Korea's claim that it was not interested in building nuclear bombs, and that it wished to participate in nuclear verification. Richardson observed that these were positive developments that should be weighed against the North Korean withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Richardson, and other regional experts, observed that it has been customary for the North Koreans to make bellicose statements regarding the West, while simultaneously moving toward engagement. For this reason, Richardson urged bilateral dialogue between the United States and North Korea, despite the displays of North Korean brinkmanship.On Jan. 13, 2003, it was reported that if North Korea could resolve its nuclear weapons issue, the United States and other countries would offer energy assistance. United States envoy James Kelly did not comment on whether or not this incentive to North Korea constituted a shift in the Bush administration's policy. By mid-week, however, it was apparent that the United States was indeed signaling some interest in a compromise solution to the stand-off. Previously, the Bush administration had stated it would not reward or appease North Korea for abandoning its agreement to dismantle its nuclear weapons program.On Jan. 17, 2003, the government in Pyongyang dismissed the United States' offer of aid to North Korea -- in exchange for an end to its nuclear program -- as ""trickery"" and ""deceptive drama."" Instead, the officials in Pyongyang insisted that ""face to face"" bilateral negotiations were imperative, and a formal non-aggression agreement had to be established.By Jan. 20, 2003, United States Secretary of State Colin Powell expressed hope that the IAEA would refer the North Korean withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to the United Nations Security Council. Should the matter indeed be taken up by the international body's Security Council, however, the possibility of sanctions could ensue. North Korea had already indicated that the imposition of sanctions would be regarded as a declaration of war.Meanwhile, Russian envoy Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Losyukov met North Korean leader Kim Jong-il in an attempt to resolve the impasse between Washington and Pyongyang. Although Losyukov offered no details regarding his lengthy discussions with the North Korean leader, the talks were described as successful. The Russian plan to resolve the impasse provided security guarantees for North Korea, as well as an economic development and aid package, while also creating a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.Against this backdrop, United States Under-Secretary of State John Bolton headed to China to seek assistance from North Korea's ally, China, in resolving the situation.In late January 2003, a South Korean national security adviser, Lim Dong-won, arrived in Pyongyang for diplomatic discussions aimed at resolving the conflict over North Korea's nuclear program.South Korea's representative, Lim, who happened to be a former unification minister, cautioned that while his efforts would be aimed at averting a war, there was no easy or quick resolution at hand. Instead, Lim observed that his job would be to create a foundation for dialogue, and eventually, the peaceful resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue.North Korea's willingness to accept mediation from other countries, such as South Korea, was considered to be a productive development in an otherwise grim situation. Previously, the North Korean government had said that it would only accept direct negotiations with the United States government. For its part, the United States government refused direct negotiations with North Korea, but later, shifted its stance and agreed to ""talks.""Meanwhile, the IAEA said it would convene an emergency session in early February 2003 to discuss the nuclear issue in North Korea. In those meetings, it would decide whether or not to refer the nuclear issue to the United Nations Security Council. Thus far, the North Koreans had been adamantly opposed to United Nations actions in regard to their nuclear program, and warned that the establishment of United Nations' sanctions against North Korea would be regarded as a declaration of war. Complicating matters was the United States' claim that recently recorded satellite imagery showed trucks at the North Korean nuclear complex at Yongbyon being loaded with unspecified materials. The finding suggested that North Korea was pursuing its nuclear ambitions in the midst of increasing tensions.Contributing to rising tensions was a missile test by North Korea. Just before the new President of South Korea was inaugurated, Pyongyang fired a missile into the sea between Japan and the Korean peninsula. The missile was reported to be a short range land-to-ship missile which fell 36 miles or 60 kilometers from the Korean peninsula. While South Korea's incoming President Roh made no mention of the missile test during his inauguration, he did call upon North Korea to step away from its nuclear program. Roh expressed the desire to resolve tensions on the Korean peninsula peacefully and criticized the United States' rhetoric in regard to the North.In March 2003, North Korea test-fired another missile into the sea off its coast. The United States announced that there were signs suggesting another missile launch was imminent. As such, ships were warned to stay away from the targeted area of the Sea of Japan (also known as the East Sea). The missile test followed another refusal by Washington to hold direct talks with Pyongyang, for the purpose of resolving the brewing conflict.Then, reports emerged suggesting that North Korea intended to test fire another missile in the near future. This longer range Rodong ballistic missile could reach any part of Japan. As such, Japan threatened to impose economic sanctions on North Korea if such a ballistic missile was, indeed, tested. Sanctions would include a halt in cash transfers and several hundred millions in exports. Japan has since stepped up surveillance patrols near the Korean Peninsula.Meanwhile, the United States air force resumed reconnaissance flights in international airspace close to North Korea. This resumption came on the heels of a United States aircraft being intercepted by North Korean fighter jets in late February 2003.Both former United States Secretary of State Colin Powell and former National Security Advisor Condoleeza Rice repeatedly stated that while they were not against multilateral discussions, direct bilateral negotiations were not likely. As well, Washington expressed no plans to establish new agreements or treaties with Pyongyang, including North Korea's repeated request for a non-aggression treaty.In March 2003, North Korea's nuclear program had been referred to the United Nations Security Council when the country expelled the United Nations nuclear inspectors. The head of the IAEA, Mohammed El Baradei, stated that nuclear inspectors should return to North Korea and the international community should send a consistent message regarding the prohibition of nuclear weapons. The government of North Korea said that discussions of its country's nuclear program in the United Nations Security Council would be regarded as both a provocative act and a prelude to war. Officials in Pyongyang also promised to strengthen the country's military forces and weaponry, noting that only strong military deterrence could protect its nation security and prevent United States aggression.At that time, the North Korean government observed that the United States-led war against Iraq had demonstrated how disarmament via inspections had not prevented military action from taking place. In light of the United Nation's failure to prevent a war with Iraq, Pyongyang said it would ignore any resolution that emerged from the Security Council meetings. Officials in Pyongyang ominously observed that it was hardly likely that a non-aggression treaty with the United States could resolve the issue of the country's nuclear program peacefully.In April 2003, delegations from the United States and North Korea arrived in Beijing, China, for the first face-to-face discussions in several months since the confrontation erupted in 2002.The North Korean government surprisingly announced it wished to pursue multilateral diplomatic talks in regard to its nuclear program. The announcement was made during an interview with a Foreign Ministry official on the state-controlled official news service. The government in Pyongyang had insisted for several months on direct bilateral talks with the United States. This reversal was viewed as a significant opening in the impasse surrounding the North Korean nuclear program.The decision to pursue multilateral talks effectively softened the stance of the North Korean government. The government of South Korea expressed the view that the shift was a result of fear and intimidation produced by the military war against Iraq. Other observers, however, believed that the government of Kim Jong-il wanted to present a more reasonable position internationally. Still others suggested that the softened stance was intended to ""buy time,"" in much the same way as the Soviet leadership would propose talks when its influence was threatened during the Soviet era. Finally, political scientists expressed the belief that intensified pressure by the Chinese produced the concession.The discussions were scheduled to last for three days and were led by United States Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian affairs, James Kelly, and North Korea's American Affairs Bureau Chief, Li Gun. The role of China in the discussions remained unclear. The United States insisted that China was another third party within the context of multilateral talks, while North Korea described China as simply the host country. Former United States Secretary of State, Colin Powell, described the talks as ""useful.""For its part, Pyongyang offered to abandon its nuclear weapons program in exchange for a package of political and economic benefits by the United States. Political benefits would include the normalization of bilateral relations, while economic benefits would include financial aid.The discussions were not likely change the position of the United States that North Korea must abandon its nuclear program and agree to verification of the process. For its part, although North Korea offered to dismantle its nuclear program in lieu of various rewards (intimated above), officials in Pyongyang stated they would not allow United Nations' verification of nuclear program abandonment. The United States said it would ""study"" North Korea's proposals.Meanwhile, intelligence reports as well as the North Korean state news agency, disclosed findings that North Korea was successfully reprocessing 8,000 spent fuel rods. Such fuel rods would be used in the production of weapons-grade plutonium. Another report by the IAEA claimed that North Korea had the capability to produce nuclear weapons and, indeed, might already possess such weaponry.In May 2003, North Korea announced it would be withdrawing from a 1992 agreement with its neighbor to the south which pledged to keep the Korean peninsula free of nuclear weaponry. Pyongyang said that its reason for withdrawing from the agreement with South Korea was due to ""the sinister and hostile"" policy of the United States toward North Korea. This announcement preceded impending talks between the leadership of South Korea and the United States, which would focus on the nuclear ambitions of North Korea.In August 2003, North Korea agreed to multilateral talks, which would include the countries in the region of East Asia as well as the United States. The talks were to take place in Beijing, China. The talks would include North Korea, the United States, China, South Korea, Japan and Russia. The North Korean official news agency said that ""the forthcoming talks would clearly show the world community whether or not the United States had a true willingness to make a switchover in its policy toward the DPRK [North Korea]."" Pyongyang said that a change in United States policy to North Korea would be essential in resolving the nuclear crisis. Tensions between the United States and North Korea intensified when North Korea's disclosed that it already had produced nuclear bombs and was prepared to produce more.Ahead of the multilateral talks, North Korea ratcheted up its rhetoric by referring to South Korea as a ""dangerous place"" and canceling its plans to take part in the World University Games in Daegu, South Korea. Meanwhile, South Korean warships again fired warning shots at a North Korean vessel which broached South Korean territory. Complicating matters was the decision by South Korea and the United States to carry out its annual joint war games on the peninsula. Pyongyang objected to these activities saying that they were akin to a rehearsal for a preemptive attack against the North. The North Korean news agency carried a report warning that if the United States failed to shift its current policy on North Korea, then Pyongyang would reaffirm its commitment to a nuclear program.The talks in Beijing in August resulted in a brash declaration by Pyongyang that they had been a waste of time. Soon thereafter, however, Pyongyang softened its stance. No resolution was produced as a result of the meeting.In October 2003, the North Korean government announced it had reprocessed 8,000 spent nuclear fuel rods and said it was now able to use the plutonium extracted from the rods for weapons purposes. The announcement also included the claim that North Korea would reprocess more spent fuel from the nuclear reactor in Yongbyon. Although the resumption of nuclear activities had been for ""peaceful purposes,"" the government statement noted that since the deterioration of relations with the United States, that purpose had changed. This admission by North Korea came only weeks after multilateral talks (mentioned above) in Beijing. North Korea then said it had no interest in further talks.By 2004, the IAEA  said it was investigating reports that North Korea made clandestine sales of uranium to Libya at a time when that country was attempting to develop nuclear weapons. A report in the New York Times stated that the IAEA uncovered evidence that Pyongyang had provided Tripoli with nearly two tons of uranium in 2001. The New York Times report also noted that the uranium sent to Libya could not have been used as nuclear fuel unless it was enriched in centrifuges.  The report went on to state that Libya had been constructing centrifuges and had a plan to purchase equipment from a black-market network run by Pakistan's former nuclear chief, Abdul Qadeer Khan, who admitted to selling nuclear secrets to Libya, Iran and North Korea. In this regard, the IAEA said it planned investigations on the basis of evidence that emerges from interviews with former members of Khan's network.  Meanwhile, intelligence agencies were reportedly attempting to determine if North Korea carried out any other secret deals with other countries or groups.In September 2004, North Korea insisted it would never dismantle its nuclear program while the United States maintained a ""hostile"" policy toward the country.  Earlier, North Korea had suspended six-nation talks to protest South Korean violations of nuclear accords.In early 2005, the Chinese government assured newly-appointed United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice that it would push multi-party talks with North Korea, which would be aimed at ending the nuclear crisis on the Korean peninsula.  For its part, however, North Korea said it has no interest in re-entering such talks, which stalled in 2003.By May 2005, Mohammed El Baradei, the head of the United Nations nuclear watchdog group -- the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) -- said that North Korea could potentially have as many as six  nuclear weapons. The IAEA chief also said that the North Koreans had the industrial infrastructure  to weaponize the plutonium in their possession.  His statement came amidst reports that North Korea might be preparing to test a nuclear bomb.Only a week earlier, the United States and Japan said they were investigating reports that North Korea had test-fired a short-range missile into the Sea of Japan.  Public broadcasts from Japan noted that the missile may have flown 62 miles (about 100 kilometers) into the sea. Japanese authorities had been on alert since warnings emerged that North Korea might test a nuclear warhead and following the withdrawal of the North Koreans from multilateral nuclear talks.Amidst this development, North Korea and the United States indulged in a war of words.  United States President George W. Bush called North Korean leader Kim Jung-il ""a tyrannical dictator"" in his April press conference, while President Kim Jung-il referred to Bush as a ""Philistine"" and ""half baked man."" (CountryWatch's Editor does not endorse these characterizations. Editor simply reports that which is within the public record.)Following a meeting with South Korean officials in June 2005, North Korean leader Kim Jong-il said that Pyongyang might return to international talks related to its nuclear proliferation program.  He added that Pyongyang might be prepared to resume the six-party talks which had been suspended a year ago as early as July 2005.  Kim Jong-il noted that North Korean participation would be contingent on respectful treatment by the United States as an ""equal"" dialogue partner.  He also hinted at the need for further consultations between Pyongyang and Washington.Despite these assertions, movement toward a return to multilateral talks were progressing.In  July 2005, ahead of the anticipated resumption of multilateral talks on nuclear weaponry, North Korea called for a peace treaty with the United States.  In an official statement, Pyongyang said that in order to resolve the current nuclear crisis, a full treaty was needed to replace the armistice signed at the end of the Korean War in 1953. In effect, a formalization of peace would replace the cease-fire and lead to the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. Pyongyang has made similar calls previously, and more recently, it has demanded a non-aggression pact with the United States.  Washington rejected the idea of a non-aggression pact stating that it would not deal with Pyongyang until its nuclear weapons program was shut down. For its part, Pyongyang accused Washington of hostility.  Indeed, North Korea has said its nuclear weaponry is needed as a form of protection against American aggression.By August 2005, the issue of nuclear proliferation on the Korean peninsula continued to dominate the political landscape. Talks between North Korea and the United States had met with little success, with no narrowing of the gap between those two countries on North Korea's peaceful use of nuclear energy.  The United States continued to insist that all of North Korea's nuclear facilities had to be dismantled while North Koreans insisted that they had the right to conduct peaceful nuclear activities.  Indeed,  North Korean chief delegate Kim Kye-gwan rhetorically asked, ""We are not a defeated nation in war, and we have committed no crime, so why should we not be able to conduct peaceful nuclear activities?""Note: The meeting took place within the context of the resumption of multilateral talks, of which South Korea had been a part.  As noted previously, multilateral talks, which began in 2003 following North Korea's 2002 withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, had stalled some time later when North Korea walked away from the negotiating table to the chagrin of the other meeting partners, most especially South Korea. The multilateral talks resumed again in 2005, but with little progress being made by mid-year.In response to the insistence by the United States that North Korea relinquish its nuclear programs before receiving any concessions, Pyongyang in the first part of September 2005 said it would continue its nuclear development activities.  Despite suggestions by United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice that Washington was running out of patience with Pyongyang, negotiators in China attempted to form a compromise agreement.  In this regard, Beijing proposed a revised draft agreement which affirmed Pyongyang's right to civilian nuclear technology. While there was no immediate feedback from either Washington or Pyongyang on the proposal at the time, Pyongyang had already rejected an offer by the South Korean authorities in Seoul to provide economic aid, security guarantees, diplomatic recognition and energy aid.  Instead, Pyongyang steadfastly maintained its requirement for  a light-water nuclear reactor for generating power in exchange for dismantling its nuclear weapons program.On Sept.19, 2005, North Korea announced that it was relinquishing its  nuclear activities and would rejoin the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Pyongyang also agreed to accept inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the nuclear watchdog agency of the United Nations. The announcement of the breakthrough was made by negotiators in Beijing during six-party talks. In exchange for Pyongyang's agreement to stop its nuclear activities, it was reported that the United States had to offer assurances that it would not attack or invade North Korea.  The United States also made clear that it had no nuclear weaponry on the Korean peninsula.  Wu Dawei, China's vice foreign minister, said, ""This is the most important result since the six-party talks started more than two years ago."" Left outside the agreement were a number of unresolved issues including the aforementioned matter of Pyongyang's request for a  light water nuclear reactor.  While the announcement was welcomed, observers  warned that implementation of the agreement could result in a host of  challenges.  Indeed, there was little actual progress reported following announcement of the deal.  In fact, a day later, North Korea said it would only comply with the agreement if it was provided with a civilian reactor.  Soon thereafter, the United States imposed financial sanctions on North Korean businesses.The 2006 Nuclear Test and ConsequencesIn mid-June 2006, reports emerged that North Korea intended to test a weapon that could reach the United States.  On June 19, 2006, the Bush administration in the United States said that North Korea had completed the loading of fuel into a long-range ballistic missile. Intelligence sources suggested that the type of missile might be the Taepodong-2 with a firing range of 9,300 miles, however, there was no confirmation on this particular point.White House spokesman Tony Snow said, ""North Korea has imposed a moratorium on launching missiles.""  Referring to a previous commitment made by North Korea to dismantle its nuclear weapons and stop further development, Snow also said,  ""We hope it will continue that moratorium and we hope it also will abide by commitments it made.""  The White House provided little further comment, however, Snow did acknowledge that the United States had held some direct talks with North Korean representatives in New York, presumably via North Korea's United Nations mission.Several countries warned North Korea that launching a missile would yield undesirable results.  Notably, Japanese Prime Minister  Junichiro Koizumi advised North Korea against test-firing the missile saying, ""Japan has been urging North Korea to stop the attempt to launch a missile. We are making efforts to urge North Korea to act rationally and with self-restraint.""  He went on to warn, ""If it does not listen to us and fires a missile, we have to consult with the United States and take stern measures.""  While the actual consequences were not specified, some officials noted that the Japanese leader was referring to a protest to the United Nations Security Council.For its part, North Korea referred to its missile program for the first time on June 19, 2006.  Absent from its reference, however, was any mention of intent to actually perform the missile test.  Monitoring of North Korean state media led to reports that an editorial had been cited in which the North declared its right to own a missile that could ""immediately halt the United States' reckless aerial espionage activity.""  The citation was believed to have been a reference to allegations regarding United States spy planes in Korean territory.An actual missile test would mark North Korea's first major launch since 1998 when it sent a missile over Japanese territory. Since then, Pyongyang has stood by a self-imposed test moratorium even as it separately developed a nuclear weapons program.  More recently, North Korea said that it required a nuclear weapons program as well as a delivery system for the purpose of countering a potential invasion by the United States.In the early hours of July 5, 2006, North Korea test-fired a number of missiles.  Most of the missiles were of the short-range variety.  Among those fired, however, was also the Taepodong-2 long-range missile, which experts  said has a possible range of 2,190 to 2,690 miles (3,500 to 4,300 kilometers). All of the short-range missiles fell safely into the Sea of Japan (also known as the East Sea by Koreans).  The first of the missiles fell into the sea less than 400 miles (approximately 600 kilometers) from the Japanese mainland. The Taepodong-2 long-range missile, which has the capacity to reach Alaska in the United States, crashed approximately 40 seconds after it was launched.  This outcome did little to alleviate anxieties among the international community about North Korea's latest move.In response, the United Nations Security Council said that it would convene an emergency meeting later in the day  to consider the missile tests.  The closed session meeting was requested by Kenzo Oshima,  Japan's ambassador to the United Nations.Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Shinzo Abe condemned the move by North Korea saying, ""This is a grave problem in terms of peace and stability not only of Japan but also of international society.""  As a result, Japan announced that it was prohibiting  the entry of officials, chartered flights and ferries from North Korea. Also, Japan's Foreign Minister Taro Aso warned that Tokyo was now considering the imposition of economic sanctions on North Korea.The last time North Korea test-fired a long-range missile was 1998 when it launched the Taepondong-1 over Japan. Then, in 2002, North Korea forged a concord with Japan by which both parties agreed to a moratorium on missile tests.  It was an agreement that was reaffirmed in 2004, but which has now been effectively abrogated as a result of North Korea's latest actions.In South Korea, the government in Seoul convened an emergency cabinet meeting and placed its military on high alert.China expressed strong concern about North Korea's actions and called on the international community to stay calm.The United States Department of State reacted to the situation by characterizing the launch of the Taepodon-2 as a ""provocative"" and attention-seeking act.  White House press secretary, Tony Snow, said that President George W. Bush was consulting with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld on the matter.  Secretary Rice called on North Korea to return to the multilateral discussion table.For its part, North Korea confirmed that it had test-fired a series of missiles and that further missile tests would be launched.  North Korean officials also warned that they would react strongly to punitive pressures from the international community. Furthermore, North Korea defiantly defended its right to launch the missiles, saying that it was a matter of national sovereignty.  That said, geopolitical analysts observed that North Korea's latest moves may have been made for strategic reasons rather than simply as an act of national sovereignty.North Korea may well have decided to launch the missiles in order to draw attention to its demands regarding its nuclear program.  Multilateral negotiations (mentioned above) have seen little progress since the talks stalled in 2005.  As well, relations between Pyongyang and Washington D.C. have remained poor.Tensions between the United States and North Korea may well have factored into the decision by Pyongyang to launch the missiles.  Indeed, two days prior on July 3, 2006, North Korea warned that it would carry out an ""annihilating"" nuclear strike if its atomic facilities were pre-emptively hit by the United States.  While the United States dismissed the threat by North Korea as hypothetical, North Korea's ominous warning nonetheless evoked the notion of brinksmanship. As intimated above, experts have often surmised that the North Koreans tend to stake out radical stances in order to push for engagement.Rather than engagement, however, North Korea was more likely to face international action. In fact, Japan was said to be drafting a resolution in response to its decision to test-fire several missiles, including the long-range Taepodong-2 variety.While most of the members of the international community were unified in their condemnation of the test-firing of the missiles by North Korea, not everyone was in agreement about how to respond.  A draft resolution by Japan was backed by the United States and the United Kingdom but did not receive unanimous support.The reticence among some countries to support the Japanese draft  was likely due to some of its particular provisions. The Japanese draft resolution's less controversial elements included a demand that countries prevent the transfer of resources and technology that could help with the development of North Korea's missile program. But the draft also characterized North Korea as a ""threat to international peace and security"" and invoked Chapter Seven of the United Nations charter.  Resolutions crafted under the aegis of Chapter Seven are legally binding and have the authority to impose not only economic sanctions, but also military action.China and Russia both said that they opposed punitive measures, preferring the route of diplomacy instead.  China said that a statement condemning the missiles tests would be appropriate while sanctions would not.  China also said that the Japanese draft was an ""over-reaction"" and warned that it would ""increase tension."" China was playing  host during a visit from North Korean officials in July 2006.  During that visit, Chinese President Hu Jintao made clear that China was opposed to any actions that might ""worsen the situation on the Korean peninsula."" For his part, Russian President Vladimir Putin also warned that ""common sense"" should not be abandoned.  He pointed to the fact that North Korea's current level of technology would make it impossible for a missile with a range of around 3,700 miles (6,000 kilometers) to be constructed.  As well, South Korea reacted with anxiety to the Japanese proposal, even going so far as to accuse Japan of recklessness.The positions taken by Russia and China, both of whom hold veto power at the United Nations Security Council, suggested that they would wield that influence to oppose any moves they deemed to be unconstructive or inflammatory. Instead it was believed that both countries would be more likely to back a non-binding statement by the Security Council, which demanded that North Korea cease the development and testing of ballistic missiles.It was a proposal not likely to be supported by the United Kingdom and United States because of its lack of legal accountability.Nevertheless, diplomatic efforts continued in the hopes that a solution might be presented. To this end, the members of the Security Council agreed to postpone voting on strong sanctions until China had been given an opportunity to broker some sort of resolution to the crisis. July 2006 also saw  United States  envoy to North Korea, Christopher Hill, convening talks in Beijing, while a North Korean delegation was visiting Seoul.In mid-July 2006, the United Nations condemned North Korea for carrying out a series of missile tests earlier in the month. The United Nations Security Council also issued a resolution demanding that North Korea cease activities related to its ballistic missile program and prohibiting all United Nations member states from supplying that country with any weapons-related materials.  The resolution passed unanimously after a reference to Chapter Seven of the United Nations Charter was removed.  That reference would authorize sanctions and military action and would be legally binding.  Its removal ensured that there would be complete support from among Security Council members.Both the United States and the United Kingdom expressed approval for the strong message ensconced in the resolution. Japan's Foreign Minister, Taro Aso, applauded the Security Council for its quick response. South Korea called on the North to issue a moratorium on missile tests and return to the multilateral negotiating table. For its part, however, North Korea angrily rejected the resolution and vowed to further develop its military arsenal as a means to ""bolster its war deterrent."" North Korea also characterized the resolution as being the result of hostile United States policy and vowed not to be bound by it.In the first week of October 2006, North Korea said that it intended to test  a nuclear weapon.  In response, the United Nations Security Council issued a statement noting that a nuclear test would ""jeopardize peace, stability and security in the region and beyond"" and ""bring universal condemnation by the international community.""A week after issuing its threat and receiving the aforementioned warning from the United Nations, North Korea announced on October 9, 2006 that it had indeed conducted its first nuclear weapons test.  North Korea's state-controlled news agency declared,  ""The nuclear test is a historic event that brought happiness to our military and people.""  The message in the state-controlled media also went on to assert that the nuclear test would, ""contribute to maintaining peace and stability in the Korean peninsula and surrounding region"" -- a diametrically opposed view to the perspective depicted by the United Nations. The state-controlled news agency also said that the successful nuclear test, which utilized local technology, had taken place at an underground facility and had not resulted in any radiation leaks.While there was no immediate verification of North Korea's claim, officials from South Korea said that an explosion measuring 3.5 on the Richter scale had been detected and appeared to have come from the north-eastern part of North Korea.  The South Korean news agency, Yonhap, suggested that the explosion may have occurred in an area called Gilju in North Korea's Hamgyong province.  Whether or not the explosion was derived from an actual nuclear event, however, was yet to be determined.The apparent test took place in defiance of warnings by the international community not to go through with the test.  In response, South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun scheduled an emergency meeting of his National Security Council.  The meeting was convened to address the serious shift in the security scenario on the Korean peninsula.  Only  days before, South Korean troops fired warning shots at North Korean soldiers when they crossed into the demilitarized zone.  It was not clear whether the North Koreans' actions were calculated or accidental.  Regardless, they were emblematic of the increasing climate of tension on the Korean peninsula, which reached an unprecedented high following the apparent nuclear test.Meanwhile, Japan's new head of government, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, was expected to discuss the matter with his South Korean counterpart in Seoul.  Prime Minister Abe and Chinese Premier Hu Jintao had previously met in Beijing to discuss regional concerns and had jointly issued their opposition to the notion of a nuclear test by North Korea.  Clearly, their joint statement went unheeded by Pyongyang.Some analysts have surmised that Pyongyang's actions of this period  -- the missile tests in July and this nuclear test three months later -- may be due to feelings that it has nothing to lose.  That is to say, as noted above North Korea said in 2005  that it was willing to give up its nuclear activities, and a day later said it would only do so if it was provided with a civilian reactor.  At that time, the United States imposed financial sanctions on North Korean businesses.  Thus, it has been theorized that North Korea feels as if it has no choice but to ""up the ante"" in order to have its interests considered.Regardless of motivation, the effects of the nuclear test augured negatively.  Apart from destabilizing the region, analysts warned that it could potentially halt any progress on reconciliation between the two Koreas, and it could well spark an arms race.A day later, attention shifted to the consequences of North Korea's claim that it carried out a nuclear test.  In particular, the United Nations Security Council was debating  what action should be taken.At issue was a proposal by the United States that would entail the imposition of strict sanctions against North Korea.  That 13-point draft resolution called for the sanctions to be implemented under the aegis of Chapter Seven of the United Nations Charter, which would make the conditions mandatory and enforceable via military means.  Those sanctions would include a complete prohibition of military trade and careful inspection of all cargo departing and entering North Korea. Underscoring this hardline stance,  John Bolton, the United States ambassador to the United Nations,  said that his country would not rule out force although it hoped to resolve the matter through diplomacy.It was yet to be seen if such a course of action would be acceptable to other United Nations Security Council members.  Despite its alliance with North Korea, China called for punitive action  in the face of the apparent nuclear test.  That said, China made it clear that it would not support the use of force.  Russia's position very much reflected that of China.  In this way, the Chapter Seven elements within the United States draft resolution promised to be a obstacle to any agreement forged within the United Nations Security Council.With China and Russia unlikely to vote for the resolution in its original form, the United States  revised the text, essentially expunging the threat of imminent military action.  A vote was expected in the United Nations Security Council on October 14, 2006.The draft document by the United States soon underwent revisions to accommodate the reservations of China and Russia.With adjustments made, the United Nations Security Council unanimously approved Resolution 1718 on October 14, 2006.  The resolution called for  the inspections on cargo going to and from North Korea to search for weapons, a ban on the sale or transfer of materials related to North Korea's unconventional weapons program, and a freeze on the transfer of funds connected with North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.  Absent from Resolution 1718 was the Chapter Seven [of the United Nations charter] provision, which would enforce the sanctions via military force.Even though the resolution was approved by  the United Nations Security Council and welcomed by the international community, total agreement on the matter of North Korea remained distant.  China announced that it retained ""reservations"" about the notion of cargo inspections while Russia said that it did not expect the sanctions to be imposed indefinitely. At issue for both China and Russia has been their shared concern that cargo inspections could spark naval confrontations with North Korean shipping vessels, thus spurring further regional destabilization.Meanwhile, South Korea welcomed the new sanctions and called on North Korea to return to the negotiating table for multilateral talks.  Japan also welcomed the new sanctions, which came days after the new administration of Shinzo Abe had instituted unilateral sanctions against North Korea, essentially banning all North Korean imports and preventing North Korean vessels from entering Japanese waters.  For his part, United States President George W. Bush applauded the United Nations for taking ""swift and tough"" measures against North Korea, in order to keep the Korean Peninsula secure.As expected, the North Korean government in Pyongyang had a different view.  It decried Resolution 1718, characterized the membership of the United Nations Security Council as ""gangsters,"" and warned that subsequent pressure by the United States would be regarded as  ""a declaration of war.""In the aftermath of North Korea's apparent nuclear test, diplomatic efforts were underway to resolve the situation and to return all parties to the negotiating table for talks.  At issue was the question of whether or not North Korea might defy the will of the international community again and test another nuclear device.There were media reports suggesting that the North Korean government was moving in a direction regarded as more amenable to the international community.  Indeed, some reports intimated that the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-il, expressed regret for the nuclear test. Other reports indicated that Kim Jong-il had given assurances to Chinese envoy, Tang Jiaxuan, that there would be no further nuclear tests.  Kyodo, the Japanese news agency, even reported that the North Korean leader said that he wished to honor the 1992 declaration, which aimed at ending nuclear proliferation on the Korean peninsula.The United States, however, did not quickly accept this version of events.  On her return trip from her Asian tour, United States Secretary of State , Condoleezza Rice, said that she knew nothing about these developments and expressed the view that North Korea demonstrated little desire to resolve the matter.  According to British media (BBC), Rice said, ""Tang did not tell me that Kim Jong-il either apologized for the test or said that he would not ever test again."" She went on the note, ""The Chinese did not, in a fairly thorough briefing to me, say anything about an apology. The North Koreans, I think, would like to see an escalation of the tension.""Editor's Note: The nuclear test and earlier missile tests intensified the widely-held view that North Korea was a threat to global security. Moreover, these moves by North Korea effectively served to further isolate the country and confirm its pariah status within the international community.A Return to Diplomacy? Late 2006-2007December 2006 marked the resumption of multilateral talks regarding North Korea's controversial nuclear program.  North Korea, South Korea, China, Japan, Russia and the United States indicated their return to the negotiating table after a year-long hiatus. The re-opening of dialogue came a few months after North Korea caused global anxiety when it tested a nuclear weapon.  That incident resulted in international condemnation, and ultimately prompted the imposition of sanctions against North Korea by the United Nations.While the news of the recommencement of  six-party talks was welcomed, there was also a pervasive sense of caution. Experts conveyed limited optimism about the prospects of forging a resolution amenable to all parties. Indeed, the United States has consistently expressed vociferous opposition to the notion of North Korea being a nuclear power, while North Korea has been equally adamant about its need for nuclear weapons.  These two absolutist positions have resulted in an impasse.In preliminary talks with his Chinese and South Korean cohorts in the Chinese capital of Beijing, United States Envoy Christopher Hill expressly stated that he believed Pyonyang had a clear choice to make.  To this end, he said, ""We can either go forward on a diplomatic track or you have to go to a much more difficult track. That is a track that involves sanctions and I think ultimately will really be very harmful to the economy.""This view from Washington, however, was not likely to resonate particularly well with Pyongyang.  First, North Korean Envoy Kim Kye-gwan made it clear that his country required nuclear weaponry for deterrent purposes.  Second, he expressed the view that the problem was not rooted in North Korea's nuclear program itself, but rather, it stemmed from the hostile stance of the United States toward North Korea.  He said, ""The biggest problem is that the United States needs to change its hostile policy against North Korea. When they change their policy from a hostile stance to one of peaceful co-existence, the problem can be resolved.""The clear disconnection between the two perspectives on the eve of the resumption of multilateral talks augured grave difficulties during the negotiating process. In fact, it suggested that concurrence was not likely to be found easily.  Nevertheless, the return of all parties to the table for dialogue presented a new opportunity to find creative solutions.  For example, despite the hardline positions referenced above,  there have been some suggestions  that the United States might be willing to consider easing the financial component of the existing sanctions.  Such a move could pave the way for decreased intransigence by North Korea.  As well, there were hopes that an earlier offer by the United States of a security guarantee could be used as the foundation for forthcoming negotiations.  That arrangement offered North Korea a security guarantee in exchange for the cessation of its nuclear program.  In actuality, the December 2006 talks ended inconclusively.A month later in January 2007,  it was announced that six-party talks on North Korea's nuclear program would resume.In the background of such developments was the  aforementioned testing of a nuclear device by North Korea in the fall of 2006.  That action did little to bolster Pyongyang's case for its right to a nuclear program, and overshadowed prevailing hopes that North Korea might abandon its nuclear ambitions and rejoin the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in exchange for economic aid and security guarantees.

The situation was made more complex as a result of a financial dispute involving North Korea and the United States (U.S). At issue was the 2005 decision by the U.S. to take action against a private bank in the Chinese domain of Macao on the basis of North Korean money laundering.  Fearing consequences of the same sort, several  other banks refrained from doing business with North Korea as well.  Now with the international community urging progress on the nuclear issue, North Korea was hoping to link resolution of the financial dispute with whatever agreement could be forged.                         By February 2007, the multilateral discussions commenced in China between all six parties -- North Korea, South Korea, China, Japan, the United States, and Russia.  Progress was quickly made during the six-party talks in Beijing when North Korea agreed to move closer toward the position of disarmament.  Of particular interest was an agreement  reportedly requiring Pyongyang to shut down its nuclear facilities  at Yongbyon over the course of the ensuing months, in lieu of aid, such as fuel oil provided by the United States and South Korea.  The draft agreement, which had been drafted by Chinese,  also called for the return of international inspectors to North Korea.

No concurrence was yet forged days after talks began. Nevertheless, spokespersons from the United States and North Korea refrained from harsh rhetoric, and instead commented on the work yet to be accomplished. Notably, United States delegate, Christopher Hill, struck a note of cautious optimism saying in an interview with Agence France Presse, ""I think we have managed to get through what we thought were tough issues but nothing is agreed until everything is agreed so we must be very cautious.""  Along a similar vein, North Korean delegate, Kim Kye-gwan, said ""There are still differences on a series of issues in the overall talks, so we will try to work them out.""

The shift in tone on the parts of both the United States and North Korea demonstrated a sharp contrast to dynamics of the previous several years.  The United States demonstrated greater willingness for dialogue during meetings in Berlin, which preceded the Beijing multilateral talks. Meanwhile, North Korea has been facing a massive food crisis in the winter months -- a scenario  that may have also contributed to the more productive dynamics in 2007.                       

By February 13, 2007, it was announced that concurrence had been reached.  As noted above, North Korea agreed to shut down its nuclear facilities at Yongbyon within 60 days in exchange for 50,000 tonnes of fuel oil or economic aid of equal value, with 950,000 tonnes of fuel oil or equivalent received after further disarmament steps are taken.As well, both Japan and the United States agreed to discuss the possibility of normalizing ties with North Korea -- something that Pyongyang has been seeking for some time.The United States also said that it would work with North Korea to resolve the banking dispute discussed above, and it would consider the prospects of removing North Korea from its list of state sponsors of terrorism.United States President George W. Bush said that the deal represented ""the best opportunity to use diplomacy to address North Korea's nuclear programs.""  In his official statement, he also stated that the agreement was emblematic of ""the common commitment of the participants to a Korean Peninsula that is free of nuclear weapons.""Yet to be seen was whether or not the agreement would be ratified by all six parties, and also whether or not North Korea would fully comply with the provisions of the deal.  For example, the state news agency of North Korea issued a report referring to the ""temporary"" suspension of nuclear activities, rather than enduring disarmament.  United States negotiator, Christopher Hill, warned that the resumption of nuclear activities in the future would be a clear violation of the agreement.In the third week of June 2007, North Korea reportedly agreed to shut down its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon and, then, disable its nuclear facilities.  North Korea also noted that it was inviting International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors to return to North Korea to monitor the closure of its nuclear program and facilities.  To that end, IAEA inspectors were expected to visit North Korea on June 26, 2007, for the first time since their dismissal from that country in 2002.

These announcements came months after the Chinese drafted an agreement in February 2007 (as noted above), in which the closure of the reactor at Yongbyon would be secured, in lieu of heavy fuel oil that would be secured by other countries (noted below) participating in the multilateral nuclear disarmament talks.   The total amount of fuel oil -- one million metric tons -- appeared to more substantial that the original quantity discussed earlier in the year under the Chinese-brokered plan.  In addition, diplomatic recognition and humanitarian aid benefits were included in the deal.  Also included in the arrangement was the untangling of aforementioned financial dispute.   With the deal now moving forward, North Korea said that it would begin the process of shutting down operations at Yongbyon within weeks, pending receipt of the frozen funds. Russia, which worked to facilitate the complex transfer, said that the money was in the process of being delivered.

North Korea characterized talks with United States nuclear envoy, Christopher Hill, on these matter as being both  ""comprehensive and productive.""  Hill responded to the developments positively but noted that the closure of the reactor at Yongbyon was only the start of an ongoing process, and would not solve all the problems at hand. Hill also said that a new round of six-party disarmament talks, which has included North Korea, South Korea, China, Japan, Russia and the United States, would commence in July 2007.                      

In mid-July 2007, North Korea said that it shut down its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon.  A team of inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was monitoring the situation at Yongbyon in order to verify Pyongyang's claim.  Nevertheless, the announcement was welcomed by the countries of the West, the wider world, and particularly by the countries participating in multilateral talks with North Korea aimed at disarmament.In October 2007, South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun and the North Korea's leader Kim Jong-ilsigned a joint declaration calling for a permanent peace agreement on the Korean Peninsula.The eight-point declaration set forth an agenda for international dialogue aimed at crafting a treaty, which would replace the existing armistice that brought an end to the Korean War that took place from 1950 to 1953.  The two Korean leaders signed the declaration following a historic summit in Pyongyang and issued the following statement, ""The South and North share the view that they should end the current armistice system and build up a permanent peace system.""

The declaration also came on the heels of a significant announcement by North Korea that it would end its nuclear ambitions.  To that end, Pyongyang formally agreed to a timetable for the disabling of its nuclear facilities.   Pyongyang also agreed to disclose details about its nuclear program by the close of 2007. North Korea has additionally been scheduled to surrender its stockpile of nuclear weaponry in 2008.

A Return to Defiance and Provocation 2008 - 2009                     In March 2008, North Korea was reported to have rest fired several short range missiles from its western coast into the Yellow Sea.  The Yonhap news agency reported  that the missiles were Russian-designed Styx ship-to-ship missiles with a range of  29 miles or 46 kilometers.  For its part, the South Korean government dismissed the missile tests by characterizing them as  ""ordinary military training.""  But the United States responded to this development by noting that it was ""not constructive.""  Moreover, a spokesperson for the United States government called on Pyongyang to   ""focus on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.""                     

In July 2008, a South Korean woman was shot to death by a North Korean soldier.  North Korean authorities said that the 53-year old woman strayed from  the special tourism zone in the mountains  into a restricted area of the Mount Kumgang resort.  More than one million South Korean visitors have traveled to the resort, which is located in a strategic nazal area,  in the last decade without any such incident occurring.  South Korean authorities responded by suspending cross-border trips, pending an investigation.  Because cross-border tourism trips have been the fulcrum of economic and cultural cooperation in the last decade, the incident had the potential to adversely affect cross-border relations.  It was viewed as a setback at a time when South Korean President Lee Myung-bak has advocated  fresh dialogue with North Korea.In September 2008 when North Korean leader Kim Jong-il  failed to appear at a military parade marking the 60th anniversary of the founding of his country, and then failed to attend the annual Chuseok festival, speculation arose about the state of his health.  North Korea denied South Korean claims that Kim Jong-il was suffering from a stroke, characterizing the suggestion as ""worthless.""  A newspaper in Japan surmised that the North Korean leader was suffering from seizures in recent months and was unable to lead as a result. As with the South Korean claim, the North Korea rejected any suggestion that its leader is unwell and blamed the foreign media for carrying out a conspiracy.  Nevertheless, the question of Kim Jong-il's health sparked questions about leadership succession in  nuclear  North Korea.  There has been no public announcement about a possible successor to Kim Jong-il and, as such, there were now anxieties about a possible power vacuum.

Meanwhile, despite Kim Jong-il's absence on the national -- and international -- scene, geopolitical troubles resurfaced when Pyongyang indicated that it would start reconstituting its main nuclear facility at Yongbyon in protest of the United States' decision to keep it on a list of state sponsors of terrorism.  The development would halt -- and even reverse -- much of the diplomatic work done in recent years.  That work culminated in the 2007 agreement calling for  Pyongyang  to relinquish  its nuclear ambitions in return for humanitarian aid and diplomatic concessions.

Pyongyang finally handed over the details  relating to its nuclear program in July 2008 and destroyed its main cooling tower as a sign of its commitment to the ""disarmament for aid"" deal.  Pyongyang then expected that North Korea would be dropped from the United States' terrorism ""black list.""  However, lack of progress on that front has led to Pyongyang's belief that the United States has not fulfilled a key component of the ""disarmament for aid"" agreement, hence its decision to restart nuclear reactor at Yongbyon.  For its part, the United States has said that North Korea would remain on its list of state sponsors of terrorism until North Korea's disarmament process is fully verified.                    

October 2008  saw the United States move to remove North Korea from its list of state-sponsors of terrorism.  The development came after multilateral talks between North Korea, the United States, China, South Korea, Russia and Japan and appeared to end some dissonance that had  been brewing in recent months, despite multilateral concurrence on North Korean disarmament.

The United States' decision to move in the direction of removing North Korea from the ""black list"" suggested that progress had been made on the verification process.  Indeed, a spokesperson for North Korea's foreign ministry confirmed that Pyongyang would now resume disabling its nuclear facilities and allow international monitors access in order for the verification process to take place. The spokesperson was reported to have said:  ""We welcome the United States' implementation of its duty to remove us from the list of states sponsoring terrorism. We have decided to resume the disabling of nuclear facilities in Yongbyon and to allow United States and International Atomic Energy Agency monitors to carry out their work again.""                    The situation was different some months later. The start of 2009 was marked on the Korean peninsula by devolving relations between Pyongyang and Seoul.  At issue has been the more hard-line approach taken by South Korea's President Lee Myung-Bak in the last year since coming to power.  Significantly, the South Korean president reversed the ""sunshine"" policy bestowed aid to North Korea.  President Lee said that economic assistance would now be dependent on North Korea's willingness to completely end its nuclear weapons program.

North Korea responded with outrage at the change. In January 2009, North Korea announced that it had enough plutonium stocks to produce four or five nuclear weapons. The third week of January 2009  saw North Korea warn South Korea that its ""confrontational"" policies could lead to retaliation by the nuclear power. Military authorities in Pyongyang told Seoul that it would bolster its ""nuclear deterrent force"" in the face of perceived threats. In response, South Korean authorities called for amplified troop strength. At the start of February 2009, it was reported that North Korea was preparing to test-fire the long-range Taepodong-2 missile. Then, by mid-month, North Korea was declaring its right to launch a  satellite as part of its space program. Since North Korea has, in the past, characterized rocket launches in similar terms, it was believed that the term ""space program"" was associated with the anticipated missile launch.                   

On the other side of the equation, South Korea's President Lee Myung-Bak has eschewed beginning negotiations from too-conciliatory a stance, cautioning previous South Korean leaders had gone down that path with no substantial end result to show for those efforts. That said, the South Korean president did not foreclose re-entering peace talks with the North. To that end, he said, in a national radio address ""I am very aware there are people who are concerned about the recent series of North Korean threats. But you do not need to worry too much. The government is ready to sit down with North Korea at any time and resolve every issue.""

Multilateral talks aimed at halting North Korea's nuclear ambitions in exchange for aid saw some progress in recent years, however, the diplomatic efforts have slowed more recently. Indeed, the stance by the new South Korean leader, which was crafted by his nominee for Unification Minister, Hyun In-taek, appears to have brought diplomacy to a halt. In fact, North Korea has threatened to end all talks with the South if Hyun was confirmed for the job.

Amidst this growing imbroglio, some analysts have said that efforts by the Obama administration in the United States could potentially thaw increasingly cold relations between the two Koreas. Obama's Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, was scheduled to travel to Asia in mid-February 2009.                   Before arriving in Asia on her first overseas trip, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton warned North Korea against any ""provocative action and unhelpful rhetoric."" En route to Asia, Clinton said that North Korea had to adhere to its commitments to dismantle its nuclear programs. She said, ""The North Koreans have already agreed to dismantling...We expect them to fulfill the obligations that they entered into.""

But the United States' top diplomat was also critical of the Bush administration for abandoning the 1994 agreement with North Korea, which was forged during the presidency of Bill Clinton. The 1994 framework, which called for North Korea to give up its weapons program, collapsed when the Bush administration accused Pyongyang of maintaining a parallel (secondary) enriched uranium program. Clinton suggested that Pyongyang's decision to restart its nuclear program may have been partially due to the Bush administration's intemperate accusations of North Korea.

Clinton was confronted with a significant challenge on the trip to Asia, and particularly, the Korean peninsula. Amidst devolving relations between Pyongyang and Seoul, North Korea was hinting that it was preparing to test-fire the long-range Taepodong-2 missile, which has been reported to be capable of reaching Alaska from the north-eastern coast of North Korea. Accordingly, she was tasked with taking a strong positions on, first,  the missile test, and second, on North Korea's nuclear ambitions, while also working to reinvigorate the diplomatic process in the region and improving relations between Pyongyang and Washington.

To these ends, Clinton warned that relations between her country and North Korea were unlikely to improve unless Pyongyang was willing to engage in dialogue with Seoul. Clinton, who was speaking in the South Korean capital, took a sharp tone as she called on North Korea to bring an end to its nuclear ambitions, consistent with the provisions of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1718. She also characterized the notion of a missile test as ""provocative."" Nevertheless, Clinton made clear that diplomacy was the central focus of her objectives by announcing a special envoy to North Korea. Clinton aimed former Ambassador Stephen Bosworth, who served in South Korea from 1997 to 2000, to that role.               

By March 2009, North Korea was threatening to go to war with any entity that tried to shoot down the (aforementioned) satellite it intended to launch. A statement by the North Korean military read, ""We will retaliate any act of intercepting our satellite for peaceful purposes with prompt counter-strikes by the most powerful military means.""  It also included the following assertion: ""Shooting our satellite for peaceful purposes will precisely mean a war."" 

In a presumed effort to augment its warning, North Korea said its military was placed on full combat alert.  This warning came  at a time when scheduled joint military exercises between South Korea and the United States were about to commence. 

The 2009  Nuclear Test, Missile Tests,  and Consequences              In mid-March 2009, according to the International Maritime Organization, North Korea set a date to execute its space launch between April 4-8, 2009.               Meanwhile, the newly-appointed United States envoy to North Korea,  Stephen Bosworth, who was in Asia to revitalize six-party denuclearization talks, noted that a launch by North Korea would be ""ill advised.""  As well, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton warned that if Pyongyang went ahead with the launch, there were ""a range of options"" that could be taken, including action by the United Nations Security Council.  Of significance was a clear effort not to ratchet tensions any higher as exemplified by Clinton's acknowledgement that six-party denuclearization talks would not be affected.              In early April 2009, North Korea said that its attempt to launch a satellite into orbit ended in failure with parts of the rocket landing in the Pacific Ocean. But such an end did little to quell the international outcry. Throughout, the United States and South Korea have said that North Korea's claim of launching a satellite in space was just a cover for an actual missile test of the Taepodong-2. Accordingly, they have urged the United Nations Security Council to issue a strong response at an impending emergency session, which was called by Japan. The United States, South Korea and Japan regard the launch to be an abrogation of United Nations Security Resolution 1718, which in 2006 banned North Korea from ballistic missile activity. On the other side of the equation, China and Russia have advocated a restrained and measured response.              

Appearing in public for his first major official appearance since 2008, North Korean leader Kim Jong-il attended a parliamentary session in April 2009 in which he was re-elected as the country's leader. His arrival in the Supreme People's Assembly was met with a standing ovation. Visibly thinner than he was in the latter part of 2008, there was speculation that his health -- possibly due to a stroke -- may have been at risk. But ahead of the parliamentary vote, authorities began a public relations campaign of sorts in which Kim Jong-il was shown on video touring farms and factories across the country. Indeed, there was even some suggestion that the controversial rocket launch that took place days earlier may have been part of the campaign orchestrated to show Kim Jong-il in control of the country. Motive aside, the matter became the subject of debate at the United Nations Security Council where member states were debating what action -- if any -- should be taken against North Korea.Late in April 2009, North Korea announced that it was withdrawing from multilateral disarmament talks and restarting its operations at the Yongbyon nuclear plant. This decision to withdraw from the negotiating table and resume reprocessing spent fuel rods came after the United Nations (UN) Security Council decided to impose sanctions on three North Korean companies.  That decision by the UN Security Council was reached in the aftermath of a controversial missile launch.  North Korea maintained that it had simply launched a satellite in space and so characterized the international reaction as""a wanton violation of the UN charter."" In the face of North Korean defiance, the United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has called on North Korea to return to its previous agreement to end its nuclear program on the Korean peninsula.On May 25, 2009, North Korea said it had successfully conducted an underground nuclear test.  North Korea said this test contained more explosive power than an earlier nuclear test conducted in 2006.

Several independent entities confirmed that a powerful explosion had been registered, resulting in the conclusion that it was caused by the nuclear test.  Indeed, the United States Geological Survey said that a 4.7 magnitude seismic tremor was detected underground and indicated a nuclear explosion of some kind.   As well, the Russian Defense Ministry was also reported to have said it detected the explosion.  The actual location of the testing was unknown but South Korea noted that a seismic tremor had been detected in the north-eastern part of the country close to Kilju.  This was the area where North Korea's first nuclear test had been conducted.

Geopolitical analysts were trying to determine why North Korea had chosen to move from negotiations to a clearly confrontational stance.  Two years earlier, North Korea agreed to close its nuclear facility at Yongbyong and comply with international monitoring of its nuclear assets.  In exchange, it was to be the recipient of a generous aid package.   Later, however, North Korea withdrew from long-running multilateral negotiations and stopped inspectors from monitoring  progress related to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.

There was some speculation that after a woeful harvest -- with up to a quarter of the North Korean population in desperate need of food aid, according to the World Food Programme -- Pyongyang may have been trying to divert attention from this internal crisis.  There was also some suggestion that the domestic worries may have prompted an internal power struggle, which ultimately may have spurred the move by  hard-liners within the regime.  Specifically, a power struggle stemming from the line of succession, with party loyalists backing Kim Jong-il's son, and the military opposing this move, may have led to the extroversion of military might.  Yet another theory centered on the notion that Pyongyang has a history of provocation ahead of conciliation at the negotiating table.

For its part, Pyongyang appeared to indicate its motive via a communique announced on state radio, which asserted that the underground nuclear testing had been ""successfully conducted... as part of measures to enhance the Republic's self-defensive nuclear deterrent in all directions.""  The statement went on to note that the test was intended to ""contribute to safeguard the sovereignty of the country and the nation and socialism.""  Pyongyang also offered assurances that the underground nuclear testing had ensued in a safe manner with advanced technology.

International news agencies reported that in addition to the underground nuclear test, North Korea also test-fired two short-range missiles.  There were reports that the test firing of these missiles was aimed at disrupting the ability of United States' surveillance of the nuclear testing.

The international community reacted with outrage and condemnation to these collective actions, which occurred  just a month after North Korea test fired a long-range missile capable of reaching Asia as well as parts of the United States.

Crisis talks were convened by Japan and South Korea respectively.  A spokesman for South Korean President Lee Myung-bak said that North Korea's decision to conduct nuclear testing  was a ""grave challenge"" to international non-proliferation efforts.  Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Takeo Kawamura deemed the path embarked on by North  as ""unacceptable.""

United States President Barack Obama called the action by North Korea a threat to international peace and stability.  He warned, ""The danger posed by North Korea's threatening activities warrants action by the international community.""  The American president observed that North Korea is ""not only deepening its own isolation, it's also inviting stronger international pressure.""

United Kingdom Prime Minister Gordon Brown said North Korea's nuclear activities ""undermine prospects for peace on the Korean peninsula.""

One of North Korea's closest allies, China, joined the wider international realm in decrying the nuclear testing.  The Chinese Foreign Ministry issued a statement that read: ""China expresses a resolute protest against new nuclear weapons tests carried out by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, in defiance of the objections voiced by the world community.""  The Chinese government also demanded that North Korea to honor its obligations related to denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.  At the wider level China  called for peaceful and calm dialogue to resolve the burgeoning crisis.

Another of North Korea's closest allies, Russia, closed ranks with Western powers in denouncing North Korea's actions.  The chairman of the State Duma Defense Committee, Viktor Zavarzin, echoed the words of United States President Obama.  Zavarzin said, ""The actions of the North Korean leadership can be described as threatening international peace and security. The whole world community should be involved in resolving this problem, in particular within the framework of the UN Security Council.""

Russia, which was at the helm of the rotating presidency, called for an emergency session of the United Nations (UN) Security Council, noting that North Korea had violated UN Security Council Resolution 1718.

In fact, the Russian Foreign Ministry categorically rebuked North Korea's actions in a statement that read: ""We cannot describe the North Korean move other than as a breach of UN Security Council resolution 1718, which prohibits Pyongyang from carrying out nuclear tests.""  The statement continued, ""The North Korean nuclear test has a serious impact on international efforts aiming to strengthen the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and breaches the international regime provided by the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.""

Indeed, UN Security Council Resolution 1718 exists in tandem with Article 41 of Chapter VII of the UN Charter and compels compliance by all member states.  A nuclear test would be an unassailable violation of UN Security Resolution 1718, which itself imposed sanctions in North Korea after it conducted a previous test in 2006.

Not surprisingly, the UN Security Council rapidly reacted with a strenuous statement of condemnation, registering North Korea's contravention of the resolution, demanding that North Korea return to multilateral talks aimed at denuclearization, and reminding all member states that they must comply with sanctions imposed on North Korea.  The UN Security Council also made clear that further action, in the form of a new resolution with stronger measures, was in the offing.

After the emergency meeting of the UN Security Council, Vitaly Churkin -- Russian envoy to the UN and the current president of the body -- made clear that work on the new resolution would start immediately.  He said, ""The members of the Security Council have decided to start work immediately on a Security Council resolution on this matter, in accordance with the Security Council's responsibilities under the Charter of the United Nations.""

Susan Rice, United States Ambassador to the UN, also said that the formulation of a new resolution with more stringent measures would commence right away.  Rice said, ""The US thinks that this is a grave violation of international law and a threat to regional and international peace and security. And therefore the United States will seek a strong resolution with strong measures.""

On May 27, 2009, the North Korean military announced it was abandoning the armistice that brought an end to Korean War.The North Korean military said the action was being taken in response to South Korea's decision to participate in  the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI).  North Korea said that South Korea's decision to join PSI --  a United States-led effort to patrol the oceans in search of nuclear weapons -- was tantamount to a ""declaration of war"" and promised military action if its shipping vessels were intercepted.  In another development, South Korean media reported that steam had been observed emanating from North Korea's nuclear plant at Yongbyon -- a sign indicating North Korea had decided to recommence the manufacture of weapons-grade plutonium.

By the end of the month, North Korea had fired a total of six short-range missiles and United States military officials warned that further missile launches were likely in the works.  Military officials in Washington D.C. said that satellite photographs indicated activity at a facility from which North Korea has in the past fired long-range missiles.  Meanwhile, with the UN Security Council contemplating action in response to North Korea's nuclear test days earlier, Pyongyang warned that it could take ""self defense"" actions if sanctions were imposed.In the first week of June 2009, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that North Korea could well be reinstated on her country's list of countries viewed as sponsors of terrorism.  With some politicians in the United States calling for such a response, the country's top diplomat said, ""Well, we're going to look at it. There's a process for it. Obviously we would want to see recent evidence of their support for international terrorism.""

North Korea was removed from the terror list in October 2008 when it was compliant with a denuclearization agreement brokered via multilateral talks.  But North Korea's recent decisions to pursue nuclear activities, manifest most blatantly in an underground nuclear test, as well as a volley of short-range missile tests, have rendered that agreement functionally void.Secretary of State Clinton observed, ""Obviously they were taken off of the list for a purpose and that purpose is being thwarted by their actions.""

Secretary of State Clinton also warned that North Korea was likely to face harsh consequences from the United Nations, as the international body contemplated a new resolution against North Korea.  To that end, Clinton said, ""  We think we're going to come out of this with a very strong resolution with teeth that will have consequences for the North Korean regime.""  She continued, ""If we do not take significant and effective action against the North Koreans now, we'll spark an arms race in North-East Asia.""In the second week of June 2009, Russian officials warned that North Korea was close to test-firing  another ballistic missile.  The Russian military reportedly claimed that it had accessed information pertaining to the type of rocker to be launched although it was unaware of a specific launch date.  This claim was somewhat supported by reports that North Korea warned shipping vessels to stay away from its east coast waters for a period for three weeks.

Meanwhile, the United States special envoy to North Korea, Stephen Bosworth, said in an address to the Korea Society in New York that his government was considering stronger responses to the challenges posed by North Korea's recent missile activities.  He said, ""North Korea's recent actions to develop a nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile capacity require that we expand our consideration of new responses.""  He continued, ""However, the North Korean claim to be responding to a 'threat' or a 'hostile policy' by the United States is simply groundless. Quite to the contrary, we have no intention to invade North Korea or change its regime through force, and this has been made clear to the DPRK repeatedly.""

Among the possible responses being considered by the United States were financial sanctions, as well as tougher inspections of shipping vessels in waters surrounding North Korea.  Related to these possible moves was the unanimous decision by the United Nations Security Council to impose harsh new sanctions against North Korea in response to the nuclear test carried out in May 2009.  Included in the new sanctions regime was the expected provision for the increased inspection of North Korean cargo not only on shipping vessels, but also on land and by air, and it authorized the destruction of any materials suspected of being linked to weapons of mass destruction. The new sanctions regime also expanded the arms embargo against North Korea, effectively prohibiting the sale of heavy and small arms by North Korea.

Rosemary DiCarlo, the United States deputy ambassador at the United Nations said: ""North Korea chose a path of provocation. This resolution will give us new tools to impair North Korea's ability to proliferate, and to threaten international stability.""  In a rare show of solidarity with the international powers against North Korea, China said that the measures showed that the world opposed Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions.  Indeed, Chinese ambassador, Zhang Yesui, said: ""We strongly urge the DPRK (North Korea) to honor its commitment to de-nuclearization, stop any moves that may further worsen the situation, and return to the six-party talks.""  He also rebuked North Korea for jeopardizing regional security by carrying out the nuclear test.

For its part, North Korea reacted to these developments by threatening to weaponize its stocks of plutonium.  United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that this threat by Pyongyang was both ""provocative"" and ""deeply regrettable.""  She warned that the move would serve only to isolate North Korea even further from the wider international community. Meanwhile, a political confrontation between the United States and North Korea could become more likely after reports emerged that a North Korea court convicted two American journalists of  ""hostile acts"" and illegal entry into the communist state.  Despite international protests and the two journalists' insistence of innocence, Laura Ling and Euna Lee were sentenced them to 12 years in a labor prison. The  families of the two journalists have urged that they not be part of the burgeoning political challenge over North Korea's nuclear activities. In other developments in North Korea, Kim Jong-nam, the eldest son of North Korean President Kim Jong-il, confirmed in an interview with Japanese media that his youngest brother -- Kim Jong-un -- was named to succeed his father. Kim Jong-nam also said,  ""The appointment of a successor is totally my father's decision."" By the third week of June 2009,  as reports emerged about a long range missile launch by North Korea -- quite possibly in the direction of Hawaii -- United States Defense Secretary Robert Gates noted that his country was ""in a good position"" to protect itself.  Secretary Gates said, ""We do have some concerns if they were to launch a missile to the west in the direction of Hawaii."" But he made it clear that the United States had approved the deployment of both radar and missiles ""provide support,"" should the American state of Hawaii face attack.  United States President Barack Obama later echoed these assurances in an interview with CBS News.  President Obama said,  ""This administration - and our military - is fully prepared for any contingencies.""The American president dismissed the notion that it was warning of a military response against North Korea.  But he also said, ""I don't want to speculate on hypotheticals.  But I do want to give assurances to the American people that the T's are crossed and the I's are dotted."" In other developments, United States President Barack Obama  renewed its sanctions -- separate from the United Nations sanctions -- against North Korea.  President Obama explained that North Korea's nuclear development combined with threats posed a national security risk to the United States and destabilized the region of eastern Asia. The American president also said his administration would end the cycle of responding to North Korean nuclear threats by granting concessions and incentives to Pyongyang.Around the same time, the United States, North Korea's neighbors and the wider international community were all  bracing for a possible missile launch by Pyongyang in the direction of Hawaii -- a presumed act of retaliation for the new sanctions.  Earlier, President Obama had said that the United States military was prepared to deal with any of contingencies posed by  a possible North Korean missile launch.  On July 2, 2009, North Korea test-fired four short-range missiles.  According to South Korea's Yonhap News Agency,  two surface-to-ship missiles had been fired from the port of Wonsan while the other two were launched  from Sinsang-ni.  All four were fired into the Sea of Japan, which South Korea regards as the ""East Sea.""  The missile tests were not surprising as Pyongyang issued warnings to shipping vessels, urging them to avoid coastal waters.  Two days later, North Korea was suspected of firing another seven ballistic missiles.  These seven  Scud-type missiles were launched from an east coast base and, as before, fell into the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea.

The timing of the missile tests coincided with the United States' celebration of its  Independence Day on July 4, 2009, and was regarded as a clear act of defiance against Washington.  Nevertheless, the United States was joined by Russia and China in calling for calm.  Russia and China urged North Korea to return to the negotiating table and said all parties should work to avoid further destabilization of the region.  The United States also said that the tense situation should not be exacerbated. Using highly restrained language, a United States Department of State official said the volley of missile tests were ""not helpful"" and said that North Korea should not ""aggravate tensions"" but instead ""focus on denuclearization talks.""  While British Foreign Secretary David Miliband echoed this sentiment by saying that tensions on t he Korean peninsula should remain ""at manageable levels,"" Japan and South Korea struck a somewhat harsher tone in saying that the missile launches constituted  an ""act of provocation."" In August 2009, former United States President Bill Clinton traveled to Pyongyang in the North Korea to try to press for the release of two American journalists, Laura Ling and Euna Lee, who had been arrested and sentenced to prison for crossing the border into North Korea.  Former President Clinton -- the husband of the United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton -- arrived in Pyongyang in the early hours of August 4, 2009 and was warmly met by a North Korean delegation that included a nuclear negotiator.   The landmark visit by the former United States leader came at a time of increasing tensions between Pyongyang and the West over its nuclear program.  After a meeting between Clinton and Kim Jong-il, a special pardon for Ling and Lee was announced.  Former President Bill Clinton is the highest ranking American to visit North Korea since his own Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met with Kim Jong-il in 2000.  Whether or not this particular success would extend to an overall thaw in relations between Pyongyang and Washington D.C. was yet to be seen. See ""Foreign Relations"" for details. 

Later in August 2009, North Korea deployed envoys to the United States to meet with New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson.  The seasoned diplomat, Richardson,  served as United Nations ambassador and Energy Secretary under the Clinton administration in the 1990s, and was responsible for helping to broker an agreement with the North Koreans that brought a temporary end to its nuclear development.

Following his meeting with the North Koreans, Governor Richardson, a Democrat who endorsed Barack Obama for president, said that believed that Pyongyang had issued ""good signals"" that pointed toward the restarting of dialogue with Washington.  Indeed, multilateral talks on North Korea's controversial nuclear program had stalled in recent times, and relations became increasingly strained after North Korea went forward with an underground nuclear, followed by a succession of missile tests.  Now, however, in the aftermath of a successful but unofficial trip by former President Bill Clinton to North Korea to secure the release of two American journalists, Governor Richardson said that he believed the climate had improved.  Indeed, Governor Richardson said that he indicated a ""thaw"" in relations and believed that North Korea was ""ready for a new dialogue with the United States regarding the nuclear issue.""

That said, an actual diplomatic breakthrough was still in the offing. According to Governor Richardson, North Korea remained intransigent on the issue of returning to six-party talks. Instead,  Pyongyang believed that it had earned some goodwill and wanted to pursue direct bilateral talks with the United States.  To this end, Governor Richardson said that Pyongyang had ""obviously used the journalists as a bargaining chip"" and was looking for a reciprocal  a ""gesture"" from Washington.

The Obama administration has indicated that while it was willing to return to the negotiating table with North Korea within the multilateral framework, with an eye on irreversible denuclearization, it would not soon engage in direct talks.  State Department spokesman, Ian Kelly, said:  ""Our goal is the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. And, of course, we want to see progress toward that.""

The White House also made clear that it had not orchestrated the meeting between the North Korean envoys and the New Mexico governor. As well, Governor Richardson expressly noted that he was not acting as an emissary on behalf of President Obama. After the meeting between the Governor Richardson and the North Korean envoys, North Korea invited the United States envoy to North Korea, Stephen Bosworth, for direct negotiations on its nuclear program.  South Korea media reported that there were rumblings about the White House giving serious consideration to the idea of actually sending Bosworth to North Korea. But on the record, the United States embassy in Seoul would offer no comment on the matter. On September 18, 2009,North Korean leader Kim Jong Il said that he was ready for talks aimed at resolving his country's nuclear dispute with the international community.  According to China's state-run new agency Xinhua, Kim Jong-il said, ""North Korea will continue to maintain its goal of denuclearization and make efforts for the protection of peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula."" In an indication that he was prepared for either direct talks with the United States or to return to six-party talks, he said:  ""I hope to resolve this issue through bilateral or multilateral dialogue.""  These declarations signaled a marked shift in rhetoric from North Korea, which appeared to be moving back toward the negotiating table.  Meanwhile,  China's presidential envoy, Dai Bingguo, traveled to Pyongyang with an eye on just this objective of bringing North Korea back to denuclearization talks. In other developments, South Korea and  North Korea agreed to the arrange reunions for separated families from either side of the Korean peninsula.  The reunions were scheduled to be held  from September 26, 2009  to October 1, 2009 in the Mount Gumgang area.The agreement was forged following talks between  delegates from the respective Red Cross societies in North Korea and South Korea.A joint statement read as follows:""The South and the North will continue to cooperate on the issue of separated families and other humanitarian issues involving the Red Cross.""The program of reuniting Korean families commenced in 2000 following a landmark inter-Korean summit.  Since that time, the two sides have held several reunions and orchestrated a number of  video exchanges although the last such meetings took place in October 2007.  Soon thereafter, South Korea's hard line government of President Lee Myung-bak came to power, bilateral relations devolved, and the program was suspended.  This 2009 agreement could be  illustrative of a possible  breakthrough between the two sides. On  October 12, 2009, North Korea fires five short-range missiles into Sea of Japan (also known as the East Sea).  The surface-to-surface KN-02 missiles with a range of 75 miles  were launched south of Musudan-ri in the North Hamgyeong Province.  As a precaution, North Korea had banned shipping vessels from the waters off the east and west coasts from October 10 to October 20, 2009, according to the Yonhap news agency.  It was the first missile launches by North Korea  in several months  and came after North Korea said that it was willing to return to multilateral talks about its nuclear program.  At a time when North Korea indicated a willingness to return to the negotiating table for multilateral talks on its nuclear program, China extended an overture of goodwill.  In late October 2009, Chinese President Hu Jintao invited his  North Korean counterpart,  Kim Jong-il,  for a visit.  The invitation was offered when a North Korean official was in China for a meeting, intended to strengthen ties between the two countries and mark their six decade-long alliance.  It was believed that North Korea was in the mood to reach out to the wider international community and was looking to re-open dormant nuclear talks.  On Nov. 10, 2009, South Korean and North Korean ships exchanged heavy fire at sea in South Korean waters when a North Korean patrol boat traversed the Northern Limit Line, which demarcates the boundary between the two Koreas.The exchange of fire was described as having lasted only for a short period of time and left a North Korean vessel in flames but with no casualties on the South Korean side. There was no information available on the casualties -- if any -- from Pyongyang.  Whereas the South Korean authorities characterized the incident as ""accidental,"" the North Koreans said it was an ""armed provocation.""

Despite this incident, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that talks between Washington and Pyongyang would go forward, as planned.  Speaking at the  Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation  summit in Singapore, Secretary Clinton said,  ""This does not in any way affect the decision to send ambassador Bosworth. We think that this is an important step that stands on its own.""   To that end, Bosworth was expected to travel to Pyongyang  for direct talks with the North Koreans following the Asia-Pacific summit. It would be the first direct contact between the United States and North Korea in more than a year.  On the agenda during that meeting would be the matter of North Korea's return to the stalled six-party talks on denuclearization. 

On Dec. 12, 2009, Thailand seized a cargo plane that was said to be carrying 40 tons of weapons from North Korea to an unknown destination. The chartered Soviet-designed Il-76 aircraft, which originated in the North Korean capital city of Pyongyang,  was refueling at the Bangkok airport when it was intercepted by the Thai military. The ensuing raid of the aircraft resulted in the uncovering of missiles, rocket-propelled grenades and other weapons.  As well, five crew members -- four from Kazakhstan and one from Belarus -- were detained and taken into Thai custody. The Thai authorities said they were acting as a result of a tip from foreign intelligence.  Reuters reported that the source was actually United States intelligence, based on information supplied by an anonymous source.  Reuters quoted that anonymous source as saying: ""It [the plane] came from North Korea and was heading for somewhere in South Asia, probably Pakistan.""While another news report stated the aircraft was headed on to Sri Lanka, geopolitical analysts suggested that the Indian Ocean island might not have been the ultimate destination.

Thai Deputy Prime Minister Suthep Thaungsuban confirmed that the weapons had been found aboard the aircraft and that a transparent investigation was in the offing. Indeed, such an investigation was likely to have international effects since the United Nations increased sanctions against North Korea earlier in the year in response to controversial nuclear testing.  Those sanctions expressly addressed the transshipment of weaponry.  But impoverished North Korea derives much of its revenue from arms sales to countries in the Middle East.

Developments in 2010 - 2011 By early 2010, North Korea indicated that part of the new phase of negotiations on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula should include a new peace treaty to replace the armistice that ended the Korean War.  North Korea said that a peace agreement should form the fulcrum of  negotiations on this matter and should be addressed prior to the return to six-party talks aimed at ending Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program, or, as a central part of those multilateral negotiations.  In a statement published by North Korea's state-run news agency, the North Korean Foreign Ministry said: ""If a peace treaty is signed, it will help resolve hostile relations between North Korea and the United States and speed up the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.""  North Korea also called for an end to the United Nations sanctions, which were  imposed after it conducted  nuclear and ballistic missile tests in 2009.  North Korean officials said that its return to the negotiating table was contingent upon the lifting of those sanctions.On January 29, 2010, North Korea reportedly fired artillery shells in the area of the Yellow Sea, close to the country's  maritime border with South Korea.  It was third day that North Korea had carried out such action, according to the South Korean military.  Speculation abounded that the provocative action by North Korea may have been aimed at forcing the United States and South Korea to respond to its proposal for a peace treaty to officially end the Korean War, which has effectively ceased via a prevailing armistice rather than an actual peace agreement.  North Korea, as discussed above,  has argued that it cannot advance further denuclearization talks without the foundation of a peace treaty. In February 2010, reports from Reuters indicated that dire economic conditions in North Korea has led not only to mass starvation of already-impoverished North Korean citizens, but also growing unrest and social destabilization as a result of these realities.  The situation has led to speculation that North Korea may be under pressure to end its boycott of multilateral denuclearization talks, with an eye on gaining international aid.  Indeed, North Korea's recent actions -- both its provocative firing of artillery shells as well as its newly-found desire for a peace agreement -- are related to its underlying desire to return to the negotiating table, knowing that any likely agreement would also contain humanitarian aid. In late March 2010, North Korea accused South Korea  of carrying out  psychological warfare by facilitating journalist tours in the demilitarized border zone between the two countries..  North Korea warned South Korea that there would be repercussions for these actions, claiming that the tours allowed reporters to tour the zone and prepare ""materials for anti-north smear campaigns."" A  statement issued by Pyongyang said those these actions were in violation of the armistice, which brought at ended to the hostilities in the 1950-1953 war.  The statement also warned that the United States would be held responsible for any negative fallout saying: ""If the U.S. and the South Korean authorities persist in their wrong acts to misuse the DMZ for the inter-Korean confrontation despite our warnings, these will entail unpredictable incidents including the loss of human lives in this area for which the U.S. side will be wholly to blame."" Analysts have suggested that this may be another circuitous attempt by North Korea to draw the United States into direct negotiations and press for a treaty officially ending the war.  North Korea earlier suggested that no progress could be made on the denuclearization issue without such a treaty being forged.  Note that these developments came in the aftermath of the sinking of a South Korean military ship on March 27, 2010, in the conflict ridden waters of the border zone.  Both South Korea and the United States said they did not believe that North Korea was involved in that incident. In April 2010, investigations into the sinking of  that South Korean warship near the North Korean border cast new suspicions on Pyongyang's possible involvement, although Seoul was careful not to expressly place the blame in that direction.  Initial reports indicated that the underwater explosion was caused by a torpedo.  South Korean Defense Minister Tae-young said that a close range external explosion appeared to have destroyed  the vessel.  In an interview with the media, the South Korean cabinet minister said, ""Basically, I think the bubble jet effect caused by a heavy torpedo is the most likely cause.""  Kim was careful to refrain from speculating about who might be behind the firing of a torpedo and said that the investigation still had to be completed.  South Korea confirmed in the third week of May 2010 that North Korea was behind the March 2010 incident in which one of its warships located in the conflict ridden waters of the border zone was destroyed. South Korean investigators earlier said that a torpedo hit the ship, killing 46 people. Despite knowing the cause of the sinking of the warship, South Korea had been circumspect in ascribing blame. Now, however, South Korea was asserting that its neighbor to the north was behind the mysterious incident. Clearly, South Korea's confidence in naming North Korea as the responsible party would change the geopolitical landscape.  North Korea immediately responded by denying any such role, promising dire consequences, and warning that war was inevitable if South Korea sought retribution. Pyongyang promised to cease any cooperation with Seoul and warned that it would abrogate the North-South non-aggression pact, if Seoul moved to retaliate. Moreover, Pyongyang issued a statement noting that ""a war may break out right now"" and that it ""will regard the present situation as the phase of a war and decisively handle all matters arising in inter-Korean relations to cope with it.""For his part, South Korean Prime Minister Lee Myung-bak described the sinking incident as a ""surprise military attack from North Korea [that came] while South Korean people were resting late at night."" Prime Minister Lee also said his country would indeed take ""resolute countermeasures"" against the North over the sinking of the war ship. Given Seoul's position that its response would be ""prudent,"" and the vulnerability of the South Korean people in terms of proximity, it was unlikely that the response would involve military retaliation.During a formal address on the matter, President Lee said his country would take the matter up at the United Nations Security Council. He also announced the suspension of inter-Korean exchanges and said that North Korean ships would be banned from passing through South Korean waters. Explaining the rationale behind these measures, President Lee said, ""We have always tolerated North Korea's brutality, time and again. We did so because we have always had a genuine longing for peace on the Korean peninsula."" He continued, ""But now things are different. North Korea will pay a price corresponding to its provocative acts.""In response to South Korea's moves, North Korea severed all ties with its neighbor, including communications links and the passage of ships and aircraft from territorial waters and airspace respectively. According to Pyongyang's official news agency, North Korea also intended to expel all South Korean workers at a factory to the north of the border, which has jointly-administered. Indeed, a statement publicized via the official news agency read as follows: ""The Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea... formally declares that from now on it will put into force the resolute measures to totally freeze the inter-Korean relations, totally abrogate the agreement on non-aggression between the North and the South and completely halt the inter-Korean cooperation.""These developments did not bode well for the process of reconciliation between the two Koreas. Still, Seoul seemed intent on winning the public relations war across the border. To this end, there were plans to send propaganda leaflets and flash electronic billboard messages to North Korea, explaining the sinking of the warship. As well, there were plans for the resumption of propaganda broadcasts to North Korea for the same reason.Earlier, United States Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, en route to Asia, made clear that North Korea would have to face consequences for its apparent intemperate actions. On the diplomatic front once in Asia, United States Secretary of State Clinton enjoyed little progress in drawing China into the equation to place pressure on North Korea. The United States, which firmly backed South Korea, was hoping for a joint response to the act of provocation from North Korea. However, China offered only a call for all sides to demonstrate restraint. That said, in a measure presumably intended to demonstrate solidarity and inflict some degree of intimidation, the United States announced it would conduct joint anti-submarine naval exercises with South Korean forces.By the first week of June 2010, South Korea had referred North Korea to the United Nations over the matter of the torpedoed warship.  While South Korea seemed intent on forcing North Korea to face consequences for its actions, it was not seeking a particular action by the international body. Instead, South Korean President Lee Myung-Bak said during a speech in Singapore that ""North Korea must admit its wrongdoing.""  Speculation abounded that with China, which wields a veto on the United Nations Security Council, unlikely to support the notion of sanctions against North Korea, South Korea was likely to be seeking some other form of international rebuke against the North. For its part, North Korea dispatched a letter to the United Nations Security Council rejecting claims it sank the South Korean warship.  North Korea also warned the international body to refrain from debating the issue, saying that it should instead facilitate Pyongyang's own internal inquiry into the incident.In the third week of July 2010, the United States (U.S.) announced that it was imposing new sanctions against North Korea. The announcement by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton came in the aftermath of her visit to the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) that separates North Korea from South Korea. Secretary of State Clinton explained that the sanctions would target North Korea's sale and purchase of arms, and were aimed at preventing nuclear proliferation and discouraging provocative actions by North Korea.

South Korea accused North Korea of provocative action over the sinking of its Cheonan warship months earlier, which an international investigation ultimately blamed on North Korea despite Pyongyang's denial of culpability. As one the most sanctioned countries in the world, these new sanctions were likely intended to intensify the pressure on North Korea in response to the Cheonan incident. In fact, as indicated by Secretary of State Clinton, they were aimed at compelling Pyongyang to take responsibility for the sinking of the warship that left 47 dead. For its part, North Korea warned that fresh sanctions would be interpreted as an act of war.

Tensions on the peninsula were unlikely to decrease since the U.S. and South Korea conducted joint naval exercises, which North Korea characterized as ""dangerous sabre-rattling."" But defense officials of United States and South Korea said that the military drills were intended to deliver a clear message to North Korea that its ""aggressive"" behavior should cease. Indeed, the North Korean official news agency reported the following statement from the government in Pyongyang: ""The army and people of the DPRK will legitimately counter with their powerful nuclear deterrence the largest-ever nuclear war exercises to be staged by the U.S. and the South Korean puppet forces.""  

On September 27, 2010, it was announced via the Korean Central News Agency that North Korean leader Kim Jong Il had promoted his son, Kim Jong Un, to the rank of general in the Korean People's Army. The news came at the start of national political meetings of the ruling Workers' Party meeting, which was itself touted as the country's most significant political conference in three decades. But it was the announcement about Kim Jong Un that commanded national and, indeed, international attention. Moreover, it sparked speculation that Kim Jong-il's son was being tapped to succeed his father at the helm of the country. At issue in recent times has been Kim Jong-il's ill health and anxieties about who would fill the power chasm after his death. With the companion news that Kim Jong-il's sister, Kim Kyong Hui, had also been promoted, there was also growing speculation that she might be tapped to serve as a caretaker leader after Kim Jong-il's death, until Kim Jong Un was ready to take on the top post in North Korea. Kim Kyong Hui's influence has been highlighted by her increasing appearances with her brother's during trips and events.

It should be noted that on October 8, 2010, a top North Korean official from the ruling Workers Party, Yang Hyong Sop, said that North Koreans would be honored to follow  Kim Jong Un -- the third-generation leader of the communist nation. Indeed, it was Kim Jung-il's father,  Kim Il Sung, who founded that nation state of North Korea in 1948 upon the notion of ""juche"" or self-reliance.  Yang said,  ""Our people are honored to serve the great President Kim Il Sung and the great leader Kim Jong Il."" He continued,  ""Now we also have the honor of serving young Gen. Kim Jong Un.""  The remarks made  official the speculation that Kim Jong Un was the named successor to Kim Jung-il.  In late October 2010, North Korean and South Korean troops exchanged fire across the border. According to accounts from authorities in Seoul, North Korean troops fired two rounds in the direction of a front line unit at Hwacheon, prompting South Korean troops to return fire. No further exchange of fire followed the incident and there were no injuries to South Korean troops. There was no consensus as to whether or not North Korea's actions constituted a direct provocation.  Only days later on November 3, 2010, South Korea's navy fired warning shots at a North Korean fishing vessel in  maritime border waters.  

In the last week of November 2010, an exchange of fire occurred between North Korean and South Korean forces, leaving two South Korean marines dead, 16 other South Korean marines injured, and three civilians wounded.  At issue was the shelling of the inhabited Yeonpyeong Island by North Korea, located in close proximity the disputed  Yellow Sea maritime border, just off the North Korean coast.  South Korea, whose military was conducting military exercises in the waters off Yeonpyeong Island, reportedly  returned fire, spurring one of the most serious clashes between the North and the South since the Korean War.  Some fifty shells reportedly landed on the island, largely hitting a South Korean military base in the area.  South Korea returned a fire with about 80 shells; the casualties on the north side of the border were not known.

South Korean President Lee Myung-bak convened  a meeting of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the capital city of Seoul.  Following the meeting, he announced that the South Korean military would punish North Korea for its attack, adding that it was vital that Pyongyang not engage in further provocation.

For its part, Pyongyang placed the blame on South Korea for igniting the clashes. It should be noted that Seoul disputes the North Korean version of the events that transpired. Nevertheless, according to the state-run KCNA news agency, ""The South Korean enemy, despite our repeated warnings, committed reckless military provocations of firing artillery shells into our maritime territory near Yeonpyeong Island.""  The North, therefore, was prepared to strike back if South Korea ""dares to invade our sea territory.""

United States President Barack Obama characterized the incident an ""outrageous, provocative act"" by North Korea. Russia struck a similar tone with Russian  Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warning of a ""colossal danger""  and characterizing those responsible for the clashes as carrying a huge responsibility.  The European Union also added its voice to the litany of condemnations. Japanese Prime Minister, Naoto Kan, took a defensive stance in the national interests of his country, saying that his government had to prepare for the occurrence of ""any unexpected event.""

But China, North Korea's closest ally, offered a murky suggestion that the two Koreas should ""do more to contribute to peace.""  A spokesperson for the Chinese government also called for restarting  six-party negotiations on North Korea's nuclear program -- a prospect that seemed practically unlikely, given these latest developments.  Indeed, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency, President Lee Myung-bak was reported to have informed a visiting Chinese foreign policy adviser, Dai Bingguo, that his country (South Korea) was not interested in the resumption of the multilateral nuclear talks; the South Korean leader apparently emphasized the importance of immediately dealing with North Korea's aggressive actions of late.

In another development, South Korean Defense Minister Kim Tae-young came under fire for ignoring intelligence reports that alerted his country of possible attacks from the North, as well as the country's slow and weak responses to the threat posed by Pyongyang.  Perhaps not surprisingly, he was forced to resign from his post.

To date, there have been occasional flare ups in the border regions since the Korean War ended without a  peace treaty in 1953.  However, the attack on Yeonpyeong Island  occurred at a time of increased tensions between the two Koreas. Months earlier in March 2010, as discussed above, South Korea accused North Korea of torpedoing one of its warships  in the area of the western maritime border, also known as the Northern Limit Line. For its part, North Korea has denied that charge and has also insisted that South Korea engage in diplomatic talks with Pyongyang aimed at easing tensions, or, deal with ""catastrophic"" consequences. Then, in late October 2010, as discussed above, North Korean and South Korean troops exchanged fire across the border. According to accounts from authorities in Seoul, North Korean troops fired two rounds in the direction of a front line unit at Hwacheon, prompting South Korean troops to return fire. No further exchange of fire followed the incident and there were no injuries to South Korean troops. There was no consensus as to whether or not North Korea's actions constituted a direct provocation. Only days later on November 3, 2010, South Korea's navy fired warning shots at a North Korean fishing vessel in maritime border waters.

At the time, South Korea  sought to downplay the incidences or the prospects of trouble emanating from the North. Indeed, during a news conference focused on an impending summit in Seoul, South Korean President Lee Myung-bak had said, ""I don't think the North will try to do anything when leaders of the international community are meeting to discuss the world economy."" He continued, ""I trust the North won't do anything but still we are fully prepared.""

On the other side of the border, while North Korea has a history of making provocative moves, many analysts said that it was unlikely that Pyongyang would seek to alienate the international community, especially at a time when it has been revealing its new leadership succession team to the world. Earlier, President Kim Jong-il's son was given a military promotion, and sanctioned as the likely successor to the ailing leader. Of course, as illustrated by the events in late November 2010 on Yeonpyeong Island, it was apparent that the path of provocation was the one being traversed by North Korea.

Attention was on the matter of why North Korea would seek to heighten the state of volatility on the Korean Peninsula.  Perhaps, for North Korea, this is a simple matter of defending its interests.  However, it could well be that the aforementioned analysts interpreted the matter of leadership transition incorrectly.  It could well be that North Korea is not concerned with the matter of alienating the international community. Instead, at this time of leadership transition from ailing President Kim Jong-il to his son, the priority from Pyongyang is to establish North Korea's power, and to show the military elite in North Korea that the named successor is not afraid to embrace a muscular stance in relation to the South, and indeed, the world.

The situation on the Korean peninsula has been made more complicated by the November 2010 revelation that North Korea constructed a  new nuclear facility. A nuclear scientist from Stanford University in the United States, Dr. Siegfried Hecker, said that during a visit to North Korea, he was shown a new nuclear facility.  There -- at the new nuclear facility at the Yongbyon nuclear complex to the north of the capital of Pyongyang -- he viewed ""more than 1,000 centrifuges"" for enriching uranium -- elements needed for the production of nuclear weapons.

Since  the nuclear facility did not exist when international nuclear weapons inspectors were expelled from North Korea in 2009, it was clear that it had been constructed quickly.  But Dr. Hecker noted that the facility boasted a high level of sophistication, and as reported in the New York Times, it included an ""ultra-modern control room.""  According to Dr. Hecker, the facility appeared oriented for the use of civilian nuclear power.  Noting that there was no sign of plutonium production, which is needed for weapons proliferation, Dr. Hecker nonetheless cautioned in an interview with the Associated Press that the new facility could be ""readily converted to produce highly enriched uranium bomb fuel.""

Dr. Hecker additionally  shored up previous reports that North Korea has been constructing a light-water nuclear  reactor.  His observations on the ground in North Korea appeared to coincide with satellite imagery depicting the construction of the reactor at Yongbyon.  Typically, light-water reactors are associated with civilian energy usage, however, uranium  enrichment is part of the process, it was not inconceivable that further enrichment could potentially ensue at weapons-grade levels.

To date, North Korea is believed to have sufficient weaponized plutonium for about six atomic bombs, although there has been little evidence to suggest that the country has actively pursued a weapons program.  That being said, Western powers have been advocating a resumption of the stalled six-party talks dealing with North Korea's nuclear program.In November 2010, a senior United States Department of State envoy, Stephen Bosworth, was in Asia on a trip aimed at reviving the multilateral negotiations. However, this latest act of provocation by North Korea on Yeonpyeong Island left the United States with no choice but to disengage from the multilateral diplomatic process, essentially ruling out the resumption of six-party talks on North Korea's nuclear disarmament for the foreseeable future.

On Nov. 23, 2010, in an interview with ABC News, United States President Barack Obama characterized North Korea's shelling of Yeonpyeong Island as ""a serious and ongoing threat that needs to be dealt with. President Obama also reaffirmed his country's alliance with South Korea, describing that country as an important ally. He said, ""We strongly affirm our commitment to defend South Korea as part of that alliance."" The United States president also noted, ""We want to make sure all the parties in the region recognize that this is a serious and ongoing threat that needs to be dealt with."" This statement appeared to target China, as he continued saying that Pyongyang needs to know ""that there are a set of international rules they need to abide by.""

By the close of November 2010, tensions on the Korean peninsula remained high, as South Korea and the United States carried out joint military exercises in the Yellow Sea, to the south of the disputed maritime border. North Korea said it viewed the previously -arranged military exercises as a provocation and warned of retaliation if there was any violation of its territorial waters. A statement from Pyongyang broadcast by the state-controlled KCNA news agency read as follows: ""We will deliver a brutal military blow on any provocation which violates our territorial waters.""

At the start of December 2010, South Korea took a highly assertive position. The South Korean defense minister-designate, Kim Kwan-jin, warned that North Korea would face a harsh response, including air strikes, if it dared to act aggressively in the future. Kim Kwan-jin's remarks were made in parliament as he answered questions during his confirmation hearing. In response to the question of how he would react to another violent action by North Korea, Kim Kwan-jin said, ""If North Korea provokes again, we will definitely use aircraft to attack North Korea."" Clearly, this posture by South Korea was a marked departure from its long-held restraint in the face of North Korea's provocations. Making clear that it intended to maintain this assertive posture, South Korea also said that it was going to carry out military drills from the aforementioned Yeonpyeong Island, even though North Korea has condemned those plans and warned that it would retaliate with force. With Pyongyang and Seoul at odds with one another in such a marked fashion, there were heightened anxieties about the renewal of war on the Korean peninsula.

Yet even with those fears at hand, the landscape became even more complicated when in mid-December 2010, South Korea said that it suspected North Korea of secretly enriching uranium at locations beyond its main nuclear site at Yongbyon.  South Korean Foreign Minister Kim Sung-hwan would not confirm a media report that North Korea was home to three more plants where uranium enrichment could take place, however, he admitted to having suspicions along these lines. During a news conference, he said, ""It is a report based on what is still intelligence and let me just say that we have been following this issue for some time."" Should this claim be proved correct, North Korea could conceivably possess material -- potentially for building more nuclear bombs. Moreover, such actions would fly in the face of renewed nuclear disarmament talks, which were already on a downward slide as a result of North Korea's latest aggressive actions (as discussed above).

By the third week of December 2010, intense dissonance characterized relations on the Korean peninsula for the myriad reasons discussed above. Former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, who also served as ambassador to the United Nations, was acting as an unofficial United States envoy in the region, with an eye on reducing the level of tensions. That job, however, was not helped when United Nations meetings on the matter ended with no resolution. Nevertheless, there were signs of progress when North Korea began to reverse course, effectively moving away from its threats to take retaliatory action against South Korea for the aforementioned military drills. The shift from Pyongyang came after South Korea evacuated residents from the area on and around Yeonpyeong Island and launched fighter jets from its terrain. Analysts surmised that the strong stance from South Korea may have forced North Korea to rethink the likely consequences of making good on expressed threats. As explained by Governor Richardson, ""South Korea was able to flex its muscles, and North Korea reacted in a statesmanlike manner.""  But despite these encouraging indications, on Dec. 23, 2010, the rhetoric between the two Koreas was on the rise once again. South Korea's president was promising harsh retaliation if his country was again attacked, while  North Korean was warning of a ""sacred"" nuclear war, if provoked.

Meanwhile, Governor Richardson -- a seasoned diplomat -- who has had years of experience negotiating with the North Koreans, announced that North Korea was willing to offer concessions in regard to their nuclear program. In an interview with the Associated Press, Governor Richardson said, ""We had positive results."" He continued, ""I hope this will signal a new chapter and a round of dialogue to lessen tension on the Korean peninsula."" Given the increasing concerns about North Korea's capacity to build nuclear bombs, this development was welcomed. But, as United States Department of State spokesman, P.J. Crowley, cautioned, ""North Korea talks a great game. They always do. The real issue is what will they do. If they are agreeable to returning IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] inspectors to their country, they need to tell the IAEA that."" In a New Year's message at the close of 2010, North Korea appeared to strike a conciliatory note as it called for dialogue with South Korea. North Korea was reported to have called for ""a lasting peace system on the Korean Peninsula,"" which it said should be made ""nuclear-free through dialogue and negotiations."" Heightened tensions have marked relations between the two Koreas since the sinking of a South Korean warship by the North earlier in 2010, and reached a nadir at the close of the year, following the shelling of Yeonpyeong Island (under South Korean jurisdiction) by the North. For its part, Seoul opted to take a more aggressive stance in relation to Pyongyang since these events by carrying out military exercises in the border zones and increasing its rhetoric. Now, the call for improved relations by Pyongyang may have been interpreted as a shift in stance, aimed at lowering tensions on the Korean peninsula. However, Pyongyang's message, which was publicized via North Korean state media, went onto to warn of increased military strength. The New Year's message said that North Korea's military would ""conduct intense combat training in an atmosphere of actual battle as required by the tense situation."" On February 9, 2011, bilateral talks between the two Koreas were reported to have broken down.  Delegates from North Korea and South Korea had been meeting in  the border village of Panmunjom with the intent of working through a number of sensitive cross-border issues.  There were hopes that the security talks would ease tensions between the two Koreas, which reached a nadir after the shelling of a South Korean island by North Korean forces in November 2010.  Significantly, these discussions were intended to set the foundation for further, higher-level, negotiations.  However, the disintegration of these talks meant that there was no consensus on an agenda for future meetings. In July 2011, some good news was brewing in the realm of foreign relations. The United States and North Korea completed a set of exploratory discussions, which North Korea's envoy, Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye Gwan, characterized as positive.  Speaking of his meetings with United States Ambassador Stephen Bosworth, the Obama administration's leading representative on North Korean affairs, Kim Kye Gwan said, ""Yesterday and today we discussed comprehensively, with Mr. Bosworth, matters of mutual interest. The talks were very constructive and businesslike and we continue to maintain contacts.""  For his part, Ambassador Bosworth said, ""These discussions are designed to explore the willingness of North Korea to take concrete and irreversible steps toward denuclearization."" These bilateral talks were intended to be a precursor to the resumption of multilateral denuclearization  negotiations.  To that end, Ambassador Bosworth said that his country would enter consultations with  South Korea and other countries involved multilateral negotiations that have been ongoing for years, to consider how to proceed further with North Korea.

Later in August 2011, though, prospects for a return to multilateral talks were dimmed when an imbroglio ensued between North Korea and South Korea.  The situation was spurred when shells from North Korea were fired close to the maritime border with South Korea.  In response, the South Korean navy  fired warning shots towards North Korea. According to South Korean sources, artillery shells from North Korea landed in the Yellow Sea close to Yeonpyeong Island, which is under Seoul's jurisdiction.  Further rounds were fired on the same day.  Defense officials from South Korea  surmised that the initial firing of shells may have been due to training exercises by North Korea.  Nevertheless, South Korea wasted no time in responding with warning shots. It should be noted that Yeonpyeong Island was in the global purview in late 2010 when North Korea fired shells in that direction, leaving four people dead and triggering the outrage of South Korea and its allies. As the month drew to a close, tension increased when five South Koreans were arrested for spying on behalf of North Korea.  South Korean prosecutors said that the five individuals conveyed sensitive  military and political information to the North over a period of two decades.  Among the sensitive material were satellite images of major military installations, as well as field manuals of United States forces in South Korea.  All five individuals were accused by South Korean authorities of violating the country's  national security law, engaging in espionage, and communication with an enemy. 

The Death of Kim Jong-il On Dec. 19, 2011, it was announced that North Korea's mercurial and autocratic leader, Kim Jong-il, had died. Blamed for keeping North Koreans on the brink of starvation, the nation on the edge of economic collapse, and the global community in a state of anxiety over the country's nuclear program, Kim Jong- il was believed to have suffered a stroke in 2008. Since then, his health was regarded to be in a state of decline.  The North Korean leader's actual death took place two days earlier on Dec. 17, 2011, when Kim Jong-il was reportedly on a train trip -- his preferred means of transportation.  His death was described as being due to ""great mental and physical strain"" as the North Korean leader was participating in a field guidance tour. Known as ""Dear Leader"" to the North Korean people, the rule of Kim Jong- il can well be viewed as one of the remaining ""cults of personality"" in the modern world.

Attention quickly turned to who would fill the power chasm. To that end, the known ""great successor"" to stand at the helm of the country was Kim Jong- un -- the son of Kim Jong-il, whom had been promoted to the rank of general in the Korean People's Army more than a year earlier. At that time in September 2010, the companion news involved Kim Jong- il's sister, Kim Kyong Hui, who had also been promoted and was regarded as a possible caretaker leader after in post- Kim Jong-il era. Of course, in December 2011, there was almost no mention of Kim Kyong Hui; instead, the international media was focused on the little-known Kim Jong-un. Educated in Switzerland and believed to be in his late 20s, Kim Jong Un was Kim Jong-il's third son; Kim Jong-un had been chosen as a successor partially because his disposition was regarded as more suitable for the post of leader than his older brothers.

At home in North Korea, citizens were urged to hold steadfast in their loyalty to Kim Jong-un. North Korean television broadcast images of news anchors, school children, and citizens weeping uncontrollably over the news that the ""Dear Leader"" had passed on.  There were some suggestions by international analysts that the flamboyant expressions of grief over the death of KimJong- il might be contrived unlike the death of the earlier North Korean leader, Kim Sung-il, who had been a beloved figure among the North Korean citizenry.  By contrast, most North Koreans would not be able to divorce their feelings of a long-standing leader from the reality of living in a country where starvation and dire circumstances characterize everyday life.

As the world community wondered about the effects of Kim Jong-il's death on the matter of international security, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported that North Korea test-fired a missile off its eastern coast; South Korean officials apparently believed the missile launch was unrelated to the news ofKim Jong- il's death, although there was no official statement from South Korea's defense ministry.

That being said, South Korea wasted no time placing its armed forces on high alert and the country itself was placed on a crisis footing. Likewise, the government of Japan held an emergency security meeting and expressed hopes that the news of Kim Jong- il's death would not have an ""adverse effect on peace and stability on the peninsula."" The Chinese government expressed distress and ""deep condolences"" over the news, and reaffirmed Beijing's close ties with Pyongyang. From Russia, the foreign ministry said it did not expect changes in bilateral relationship with North Korea. Across the Pacific in the United States, President Barack Obama reportedly discussed the situation with South Korean President Lee Myung-bak and promised that its commitment to stability on the Korean Peninsula remained intact. A statement from the White House read as follows: ""We remain committed to stability on the Korean peninsula, and to the freedom and security of our allies.""

Ironically, news of Kim Jong-il's death came only days after a bilateral deal was forged between the United States and North Korea to exchange 240,000 tons of food from the United States for North Korea's pledge to move towards denuclearization . The agreement was brokered during talks in China between Robert King, United States special envoy on North Korean human rights, and Ri Kun, director general for North American affairs at North Korea's Foreign Ministry, and was intended to set the tone for forthcoming multilateral nuclear negotiations. Six-party talks -- involving North Korea, South Korea, Japan, China, Russia, and the United States -- have stalled since late 2008.

According to South Korea's Yonhap news agency, Washington and Pyongyang ""reached the agreement based on North Korea's pledge to implement initial measures of denuclearization that include a suspension of its uranium-enrichment program."" North Korea, which has been plagued by chronic food shortages, would soon received shipments of food aid, including biscuits and nutritional supplements for infants, rather than rice, which was requested by the North Koreans. United States officials have apparently been concerned that rice would be given to the country's military rather than used to alleviate the dire circumstances of the North Korean general populace.

There was some speculation about the late Kim Jong-il's involvement in  forging this agreement, given the timing of the death announcement.  If Kim Jong-il's health was devolving to the extent that he had died from ""great mental and physical strain,"" then was it possible for him to be involved in such significant negotiations?

Such speculation was only heightened when, on Dec. 20, 2011, South Korean authorities began to express skepticism about the public details pertaining to the death of Kim Jong-il  during a field guidance tour.  Indeed, the leader of South Korea's intelligence service said he had doubts about the time and location of  the North Korean leader's death. National Intelligence Service head, Won Sei-hoon, reportedly told the members of a parliamentary committee that the very train Kim Jong-il used for travel -- and which was supposedly the venue of the North Korean leader's death -- was identified at Pyongyang's train station.  As reported by the Korean Herald, Won Sei-hoon noted, ""There were no signs the train ever moved."" Certainly, if the train was not used for any travel, it was not possible that Kim Jong- il could have died aboard it while participating in the aforementioned field guidance tour, as officially declared by the North Korean authorities.

The quasi-mystery surrounding the actual details of Kim Jong-il's death aside, North Korea was concentrating its efforts on shoring up the image of Kim Jong-un as the undisputed new leader of the secretive communist nation. As reported by the New York Times, North Korean television broadcast images of the country's senior military leaders saluting Kim Jong-un  as he received mourners at a mausoleum, where the body of Kim Jong-il laid in state.  The particular imagery was ostensibly intended to show that Kim Jong-un had gained the allegiance of North Korea's powerful military. Meanwhile, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported that  Kim Jong-un had carried out one of his first measures of supreme power by ordering all North Korean troops to cancel their field exercises and return to their barracks.

His military influence notwithstanding, Kim Jong-un had yet to assume leadership as the general secretary of North Korea's Workers' Party  -- the political power base of the country.  Since 2010, Kim Jung-un held the position of vice chairman of the Central Military Commission of the ruling party.

Ultimately, Kim Jong-un would have to consolidate his power both symbolically and practically, or he could be relegated to a figurehead role at the helm of a ruling  military cadre.  But speculation on that score came to a close at the end of the year when  Kim Jong-un was offically named supreme commander of the country's armed forces. That particular appointment was made in accordance with provisions set forth in Kim Jong-il's will.

It was yet to be seen how Kim Jong-un would relate to international powers, who were  themselves anxious to see North Korea would move substantially in the direction of denuclearization at a time of sensitive geopolitical tensions across the globe. Following the funeral for the late Kim Jong-il on Dec. 28, 2011, state media in North Korea delivered a message from the powerful National Defense Commission of that country making ot clear that there would be no change in foreign policy orientation from Pyongyang in the post Kim Jong-il era.  The statement read as follows: ""We declare solemnly and confidently that the foolish politicians around the world, including the puppet group in South Korea, should not expect any change from us."" Indeed, during the memorial funeral service for Kim Jong-il,  the North Korean head of state, Kim Yong-name made it clear that the country -- now under new leadership -- intended to ""march firmly along the path of Songun taught by great leader Kim Jong-il.""  The term ""Songun"" refers to  North Korea's ""military first"" policy. Clearly, the military imperatives of North Korea would prevail even in the post Kim Jong-il era.

Developments in 2012On Feb. 29, 2012, North Korea formalized its ""denuclearization for food""  agreement with the United States.The terms of the bilateral deal included  the exchange of 240,000 tons of food from the United States for North Korea's pledge to move towards denuclearization.  The agreement included provisions for a North Korean moratorium on nuclear tests, long-range missile launches and uranium enrichment at its Yongbyon nuclear center,  and acceptance of  United Nations inspectors who would monitor the implementation of the terms.  North Korea's acquiescence on this matter  raised the possibility of ending the diplomatic impasse, which had allowed its nuclear program to continue for years without international oversight.

Of course it should be noted that the agreement was not a new one; in fact it first came to light in the days prior to the news of the death of former North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il late in 2011.  The agreement was brokered in December 2011  during talks in China between Robert King, United States special envoy on North Korean human rights, and Ri Kun, director general for North American affairs at North Korea's Foreign Ministry.

At the time, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported that  Washington and Pyongyang ""reached the agreement based on North Korea's pledge to implement initial measures of denuclearization that include a suspension of its uranium-enrichment program"" in exchange for much-needed food. North Korea, which has been plagued by chronic food shortages, would soon received shipments of food aid, including biscuits and nutritional supplements for infants, rather than rice, which was requested by the North Koreans. United States officials have apparently been concerned that rice would be given to the country's military rather than used to alleviate the dire circumstances of the North Korean general populace.

The agreement  was intended to set the tone for forthcoming multilateral nuclear negotiations. Six-party talks -- involving North Korea, South Korea, Japan, China, Russia, and the United States -- have stalled since late 2008.For its part, the United States welcomed the North Koreans' movement on the breakthrough deal, deeming it ""important, if limited.""  The United States Department of State spokeswoman, Victoria Nuland, took a cautiously optimistic saying,  ""The United States still has profound concerns regarding North Korean behavior across a wide range of areas, but today's announcement reflects important, if limited, progress in addressing some of these.""

Striking a similar tone, the director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Yukiya Amano, characterized the announcement ""an important step forward."" He continued, ""Pending further details, we stand ready to return to Yongbyon to undertake monitoring activities upon request and with the agreement of the agency's board of governors.""In the aftermath of a  ""denuclearization for food"" agreement with the United States, there were high hopes that the deal would facilitate progress in multilateral negotiations on North Korea's nuclear program.  Those high hopes were somewhat dashed by news that North Korea intended to launch a satellite into orbit.

Pyongyang announced on March 16, 2011, that it would launch an ""earth observation"" satellite, or the Kwangmyongsong-3, using a long-range rocket.  The event was intended  to mark the 100th birthday of its late leader Kim Il-Sung.  Of course, such a move would be contrary to the prevailing United Nations resolutions, which prohibits North Korea's use of long-range intercontinental ballistic missile technology,  as well as the aforementioned ""denuclearization for food"" agreement, the latter of which requires North Korea to adhere to a moratorium on nuclear tests and long-range missile launches.

Not surprisingly, all the other countries involved in multilateral negotiations -- South Korea, Japan, China, Russia, and the United States -- expressed dismay over this plan by North Korea.  United States Department of State spokesperson, Nuland,  pointed to this concurrence and urged North Korea to rethink the satellite launch saying, ""Obviously, we were heartened that every single one of the six-party talks participants made clear that they think that this would be an extremely bad idea and a violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions, so we are hoping and expecting that the DPRK will take that to heart.""  The United States also noted it would be ""very hard"" to go forward with its planned food assistance if North Korea moved ahead with the plan to launch a satellite into orbit.

The geopolitical complexity of the Korean peninsula became more complicated on March 21, 2012, when the White House in the United States announced that President Barack Obama intended to visit to the world's most heavily militarized border -- the  Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ).  The White House explained that the trip to the DMZ was intended  to convey the president's support  for the  30,000 United States troops stationed in South Korea, and to augment bilateral relations between Washington and Seoul.  In a press briefing, Daniel Russel, Asia director for the White House National Security Council, said: ""The DMZ is the front line of democracy in the Korean Peninsula, and it's the symbol of the U.S. and [South Korean] resolve, as well as solidarity. So a visit by the president there to see and to thank the U.S. and the South Korean service members makes perfect sense.""

After his visit to the DMZ, President Obama was set to attend a global summit  aimed at reducing the risk of nuclear terrorism in the South Korean capital of Seoul.  Ahead of the Nuclear Security Summit, President Obama reiterated his call for  ""a world without nuclear weapons"" and advanced his foreign policy agenda that advocates  non-proliferation and the reduction of  nuclear weapons through increase diplomacy.

In a speech to students at South Korea's Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, President Obama said the United States -- the only nation to have ever used nuclear weapons -- was fully committed to  reducing its stockpile of nuclear arms.  The United States leader said his country had a""moral obligation"" to pursue strategic arms cuts.  President Obama also drew thunderous applause from the audience of students when he said that, as a father, he did not wish to see his daughters growing up in a world with nuclear threats. 

""I say this as president of the only nation ever to use nuclear weapons,"" Obama said. ""I say it as a commander in chief who knows that our nuclear codes are never far from my side. Most of all, I say it as a father, who wants my two young daughters to grow up in a world where everything they know and love can't be instantly wiped out.""

President Obama acknowledged his country's unique position in the world, but he noted that ""serious sustained global effort"" was needed to achieve his expressed hope for a nuclear weapons-free world.

The issue of nuclear proliferation has been at the forefront of the international purview given the ongoing concerns about North Korea's nuclear arsenal.  Addressing the matter of North Korea's nuclear ambitions, President Obama made it clear that the United States held ""no hostile intent"" to that country, but warned that there would be ""no rewards for provocation.""

The United States president said:  ""The United States has no hostile intent toward your country...We are committed to peace. And we are prepared to take steps to improve relations, which is why we have offered nutritional aid to North Korean mothers and children.""  President Obama continued, ""But by now it should be clear, your provocations and pursuit of nuclear weapons have not achieved the security you seek -- they have undermined it. Instead of the dignity you desire, you're more isolated. Instead of earning the respect of the world, you've been met with strong sanctions and condemnation. You can continue down the road you are on, but we know where that leads. It leads to more of the same -- more broken dreams, more isolation, ever more distance between the people of North Korea and the dignity and the opportunity that they deserve.""

President Obama reiterated the warning already issued by his government that the long-range missile launch to place a satellite in orbit would only result in isolation for Pyongyang.He said,  ""With respect to North Korea, we are going to be both sending messages to North Korea that they should not go forward with this missile launch, which would violate existing U.N. Security Council resolutions. And our hope is, is that we can resolve these issues diplomatically.""President Obama also joined South Korean President Lee Myung-bak in noting that North Korea would be subject to further sanctions if it did not cancel its launch plans. Making clear the options available for North Korea, President Obama addressed the leadership of that country saying, ""You can continue with the road you are on but we know where that leads...Today, we say: Pyongyang, have the courage to pursue peace.""For his part,  Kim Jong Un -- North Korea's new leader -- appeared to be following his father's footsteps in the realm of rhetoric as he deemed the  nuclear summit to be  ""a childish farce.""  Earlier, Pyongyang asserted that  denunciations of North Korea  would amount to a ""declaration of war.""

Pyongyang was also signaling that it had no intention of pulling back from its missile launch to sent a satellite into orbit. Instead,  South Korean sources were reporting that North Korea  moved a long-range rocket to a launch pad close to the Chinese border.  As well, satellite imagery appeared to depict preparations for the launch, which Pyongyang had said would take place between April 12-16, 2012.  The guidance was that the rocket would follow a  trajectory that would take it close to south-western Japan.

Accordingly, Japan's defense ministry made it clear that it had ordered the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) to intercept North Korea's rocket launch, if necessary, using its missile shield.  Japanese authorities also alerted rescue personnel that they would be mobilized to deal with potential disasters, should the  veer off course. Already, the South Korean government had said that it would  shoot down any North Korean rocket that strayed into its territory. As well, the United States was sea-based X-band radar into the Pacific to monitor the launch. Upset about the prospect of rocket debris affecting countries of the Pacific, President Benigno Aquino III of the Philippines called on Pyongyang to abandon the launch plans.

It should be noted that the Obama administration in the United States canceled its food aid program to North Korea due to that country's decision to move forward with the satellite launch.  An official from the Pentagon was cited as saying: ""Why we're not providing that food assistance at this point is because our confidence in their ability to meet their agreements has been diminished. We do not use it as a lever to change their policies.""

A week ahead of the timeline expected for the North Korean missile launch, President Kim Jong Un warned that any country that dared to interfere with its plans  would face ""immediate, resolute and merciless punishment.""  In a statement published by  the Korean Central News Agency, the North Korean leader asserted: ""(Any country that) intercepts the satellite or collects its debris will meet immediate, resolute and merciless punishment.""  Pyongyang also warned South Korea against intercepting the rocket booster, should it stray into South Korean territorial waters.  Pyongyang promised that an interception by Seoul would bring about ""the end of everything in South Korea.""

On April 10, 2012, the United States was reiterating its warnings to North Korea that the launch of a new missile would be ""a clear and serious violation"" of international agreements.  White House press secretary Jay Carney said in an interview with journalists: ""The proposed missile launch, if conducted, would represent a clear and serious violation of North Korea's obligations under two United Nations Security Council resolutions that explicitly prohibit North Korea from testing ballistic missiles.""  Carney said the United States intended to work allied countries on implementing consequences for North Korea, should it proceed with its provocative missile launch; Carney noted that United States food aid to North Korea could be cut off.

By April 13, 2012, news emerged from North Korea that although that country attempted to launch its satellite into space, the long-range rocket failed to reach orbit.  Despite the spectacular failure of the mission, the attempted action was nonetheless widely condemned by the international community.  Notably, members of the Group of Eight industrial nation states issued a joint condemnation, noting that the launch was in clear violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions prohibiting intercontinental missile deployments.

In a related development, South Korean officials were noting that new satellite imagery suggests that North Korea was preparing to carry out a nuclear test. The imagery depicted piles of earth and sand at the entrance of a tunnel at a nuclear site, where previous nuclear bomb testing was carried out in 2006 and 2009.  An anonymous source was quoted by Agence France Presse as saying: ""Recent satellite images led us to conclude the North has been secretly digging a new underground tunnel in the nuclear test site... besides two others where the previous tests were conducted.""  Given the aforementioned launch failure, there were some suggestions that North Korea might try to ""save face"" by moving forward with an even more provocative act -- quite possibly, a nuclear test.  Of course, such an act would be regarded as a clear move down the path of confrontation by North Korea's regional neighbors as well as Western powers.

By the third week of April 2012, presumably as a cautionary move, South Korea  announced that it had deployed missiles with a range of 625 miles. The weapons would be able to strike nuclear targets inside North Korea.

As April 2012 entered its final week, North Korea was ratcheting up the militaristic rhetoric as it threatened to  initiate military action against South Korean targets and characterized South Korean President Lee Myung-bak a ""traitor"" and ""scum."" In a statement, Pyongyang issued the following threat: ""The special actions of our revolutionary armed forces will start soon to meet the reckless challenge of the group of traitors.  Once the … special actions kick off, they will reduce all the rat-like groups and the bases for provocations to ashes in 3 or 4 minutes ... by unprecedented peculiar means and methods of our own style.""

Meanwhile, reports suggested that North Korea was close to completing preparations for a  nuclear test. This move -- if successful -- would constitute North Korea's third nuclear test after two in 2006 and 2009. The global community was watching events unfold in North Korea closely as  Pyongyang may now have the capacity to conduct a test using highly enriched uranium for the very first time.  This development would presage North Korea's possible ability to  significantly build up its stocks of weapons-grade nuclear material.  As well, it would facilitate the manufacture of a nuclear warhead to mount on a long-range missile.  Should North Korea go forward with its third nuclear test, it would be a clear example of the limits of China's influence on the paranoid  regime ruling North Korea today.On July 25, 2012, news emerged from North Korea that the country's new leader, Kim Jong-un, was  married to a woman seen in his company at a number of public events. North Korean state media finally confirmed that the country's leader Kim Jong-un was married and identified the leader's spouse as  ""Comrade Ri Sol-ju.""  There was no sense of when their marriage actually took place, although South Korean media suggested it was not a new development. The news of the marital status of the North Korean president, who succeeded his father Kim Jong-il at the start of the year, came weeks after a military shakeup. The military shuffle was interpreted as an attempt by Kim Jong-un to place his own stamp of authority on North Korea's most powerful institution.  Now, with news of his marriage being made public and given his public appearances with his wife, some analysts were additionally suggesting that the new North Korean leader was also trying to establish his own, more accessible, image in the North Korean context.

That accessible image, however, did not necessarily augur a reformist inclination in the realm of government and politics.  As July 2012 drew to a close, Pyongyang dismissed the notion of reform. A spokesperson for North Korea's Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea, which directs relations with South Korea, put the idea of reform to rest, insisting that Kim Jong-un would maintain the ""military first"" policy of his father, the late Kim Jong-il. The spokesperson also spoke derisively of reports of possible changes in orientation from the North, which had emanated from the South, saying: ""The puppet group (South Korea)... tried to give (the) impression that the present leadership of the DPRK (North Korea) broke with the past. This is the height of ignorance. To expect policy change and reform and opening from the DPRK is nothing but a foolish and silly dream, just like wanting the sun to rise in the west."" On Jan. 1, 2013, North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un, delivered arare new year's message on state television.  His address -- the first new year's  speech in almost two decades --  focused on the imperatives of economic development and reunification of the two Koreas.  The call for a unified Korea came only weeks after Park Geun-hye was elected as the first female president of South Korea.  In power since 2011 himself, Kim Jong-un may have been attempting to establish better relations with South Korea, which was now coming under new leadership itself.  Notably, Kim Jong-un warned that confrontation had only resulting in war. That being said, he continued to emphasize the military element as a national priority for North Korea. To that end, he said: ""The military might of a country represents its national strength. Only when it builds up its military might in every way can it develop into a thriving country.""  Of course, North Korea has long been suffering from a famine and only a month prior (s discussed below) carried out a long-range rocket launch that was certain to elicit consequences from the United Nations  Security Council. Meanwhile, at the start of December 2012, North Korea announced plans to carry out a new satellite launch.  A failed attempt to launch an ""earth observation"" satellite ensued in April 2012 when the long-range rocket crashed into the sea after traveling only a short distance.Now, in December 2012, North Korea was planning to launch a second version of Kwangmyongsong-3 (called the Unha-3) into space from the Sohae Space Center in  North Phyongan Province. The official North Korean state news agency said the satellite launch was set to occur roughly between Dec. 10, 2012, and Dec. 22, 2012. The United States issued a warning that the long-range missile launch to place a satellite in orbit  would threaten global peace and security, and  only result in isolation for Pyongyang. The United States also noted, as it did in April 2012, that such a move would be contrary to the prevailing United Nations resolutions, which prohibits North Korea's use of long-range intercontinental ballistic missile technology.  In a written statement, United States Department of State spokesperson Victoria Nuland declared:  ""A North Korean 'satellite' launch would be a highly provocative act that threatens peace and security in the region...Any North Korean launch using ballistic missile technology is in direct violation of UN Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs) 1718 and 1874.""  Nuland also noted that her country would be consulting with key partner countries, such as South Korea, Japan, China, and Russia, to discuss further steps in regards to these proposed moves by North Korea.  By Dec. 7. 2012, there were more signs that the rocket launch plan was going forward as fuel-injection work  was reported to be taking place, according to South Korean media. Days earlier on Dec. 4, 2012, North Korea confirmed its plans to go forward with the rocket launch as it conveyed plans to the International Maritime Organization -- the United Nations' shipping agency.  Typically, such notification to the International Maritime Organization in such instances. Further details about the launch were released including the news that the three-stage rocket was expected to fly on a southward path and would drop into the sea off the west coast of South Korea, ultimately  landing in waters to the east of the Philippines. Since the flight path would take the rocket close to Japan's Okinawa island, the government of Japan was  positioning missile defense interceptors in order to be prepared  for the rocket charting off course.  It should be noted that this long-range rocket has sufficient range to reach the western part of the United States.  On Dec. 9, 2012, North Korean authorities announced that the rocket launch -- due to take place between Dec. 10, 2012 and Dec. 22, 2012 -- was being delayed due to technical difficulties.  However, by Dec. 11, 2012, those technical difficulties were apparently resolved as international news media outlets reported that North Korea had fired its long-range Unha-3 rocket rocket from its west coast. According to the South Korean Yonhap News Agency, some debris from the rocket fell into waters off the Philippines after passing over the Japanese city of Okinawa, consistent with the expected trajectory.The firing of the rocket was supposedly  intended to launch a satellite into space.  North Korea announced that its goal had been achieved and a satellite was placed in orbit.The North Korean state news agency claimed success in its goal, declaring: ""The launch of the second version of our Kwangmyongsong-3 [Unha-3] satellite from the Sohae Space Centre... on December 12 was successful. The satellite has entered the orbit as planned.""  It should be noted that while United States officials confirmed there was an object launched into orbit, it also noted that the object appeared to be wobbling off course.  South Korean defense sources had a somewhat different view and suggested that the satellite  was not necessarily  wobbling off course or out of control.  The South Koreans said that the satellite may have been intended to be in a circular orbit but was instead an elliptical orbit.  There were also some questions about the level of success achieved in this exercise by the North Koreans.  Some experts, such as Vassily Mikheev of Russia's Institute for World Economy and International Relations, have pointed to the fact that North Korean engineers used old technology to launch the satellite into orbit. Mikheev noted that Scud technology  was intended for small missiles, and therefore  not particularly reliable  for firing a three-phased operation.  Of course, the conventional wisdom was that the entire exercise was a pretense, and intended to demonstrate North Korea's technological capacity to deliver a nuclear warhead on a intercontinental ballistic missile.  Regardless of actual motivation, the move by North Korea was made in defiance of international warnings that Pyongyang refrain from such provocative activity, and certainly in clear violation of prevailing United Nations Security Council resolutions.  Accordingly, the United Nations Security Council wasted no time in condemning North Korea for its actions, and making note that the launch was""a clear violation of Security Council resolutions.""  China -- North Korea's closest ally -- expressed ""regret"" over North Korea's decision to fire the rocket while calling for restraint on the part of the international community in response.  But  the United States was already  warning that Pyongyang would face consequences for its ""highly provocative act that threatens regional security.""  There were suggestions that a new resolution by the United Nations Security Council was in the offing, but with China's position on such a measure unknown.  Meanwhile, all expectations were that North Korea was likely going to carry out a nuclear test.  In 2009, following a rocket launch that year, North Korea carried out its second ever nuclear test.North Korea's first nuclear test was carried out in 2006.  Two rounds of sanctions were imposed on North Korea in response to those provocative actions. Now, with another rocket launch accomplished, it was anticipated that North Korea would again follow that path and carry out a third nuclear test. Of course, it should be noted that North Korea was pursuing expensive  nuclear development and rocket delivery technology even as most of its population lived in a state of abject poverty.  Thus, the notion of further economic sanctions was unlikely to deter the paranoid and reclusive regime, which has long privileged its military agenda ahead of domestic concerns.

2013 Special Report:  North Korea - A Threat to Global Security? Summary: On Feb. 12, 2013, North Korea carried out its third nuclear test, earning the wide and vociferous condemnation of the international community.  North Korea cast the test as a restrained response and warned of further actions in the face of ""U.S. hostility.""  The nuclear test was not unexpected, coming on the heels of a rocket launch in December 2012, which led to the United Nations'  early 2013 decision to tighten sanctions against North Korea.  North Korea under its new leader, Kim-Jong-un, has increased the anxiety of the international community by intensifying its rhetoric and threatening even more provocative actions. In the face of such provocation, the United Nations Security Council  convened an emergency meeting to consider measures against North Korea -- a country that has, to date, been undeterred by international action or prevailing international law.  Indeed, the very existence of sanctions has not stopped North Korea from repeatedly violating the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.  North Korea's lack of concern for international opinion was displayed in high relief in mid-February 2013 when the state-controlled newspaper declared the country's need for intercontinental ballistic missiles.  Anxieties over global security reached new heights as news reports began to emerge about Iran playing a role in North Korea's nuclear development program. In March 2013,  the United Nations Security Council acted against North Korea by  unanimously adopting Resolution 2094, which censured North Korea for its February 2013 nuclear test and imposing an even stricter sanctions regime on that country. At that time, tensions were increasing on the Korean peninsular, with North Korea using sharp rhetoric to issue threats against South Korea, even ending its armistice with the South that brought an end to the hostilities between the two Koreas, and ultimately declaring it was in ""a state of war"" with South Korea.  North Korea also cut off its emergency hotline with South Korea; by April 2013, North Korea  decided to re-open its nuclear complex at Yongbyon  and ceased border crossing access for South Koreans into the jointly-administered Kaesong industrial zone, which has often been viewed as a symbol of cross-border cooperation. North Korea, meanwhile, declared its enmity with the United States, warning that strikes on American interests might be in the offing, and pointing to United States military interests in Japan and Guam, presumably indicated they might be on Pyongyang's target list.  The North Korean military additionally claimed to have ""ratified"" a possible attack on the United States. But by May 2013, the political climate appeared to have cooled and North Korea withdrew  two intermediate range missiles it had placed earlier on its east coast.  Nevertheless,  North Korea went onto to carry out four short range missile tests in mid-May 2013.  It was not known if North Korea was trying to re-ignite geo-political tensions or if the tests were routine exercises intended to simply show military might.  A month later in June 2013, there was a bizarre mix of progress and retreat on the diplomatic front as the two Koreas  planned and then cancelled bilateral negotiations; however, North Korea then proposed direct talks with the United States. In August  2013 through September 2013, the two Koreas finally agreed to re-open operations at the jointly-administered Kaesong industrial zone. But in the second week of September 2013, signs pointed to the fact that operations were being restarted at North Korea's Yongbyon reactor.  It seemed that regardless of calming of tensions, North Korea was going forward with the threat made in April 2013 about re-opening its Yongbyon facility. Background: On Jan. 22, 2013,  the United Nations Security Council unanimously approved a resolution authorizing tighter sanctions against North Korea over its December 2012 rocket launch, which  at the time spurred international condemnation.   North Korea angrily responded  to the move by promising further rocket launches and nuclear testing, and also warning of retribution against the United States, which it described as a ""sworn enemy.""  The following statement was issued via the official Korean Central News Agency: ""We do not hide that a variety of satellites and long-range rockets will be launched and a nuclear test of higher level will be carried out in the upcoming new phase of the anti-U.S. struggle, targeting against the U.S., the sworn enemy of the Korean people.""  Pyongyang soon expanded its threats to note that it would take action against South Korea if it participated in the United Nations sanctions regime.  China's  official Xinhua News Agency also reported that Pyongyang intended to walk away from multilateral six-part talks since ""the U.N. Security Council has been reduced into an organization bereft of impartiality and balance."" North Korea has not been a stranger to strong rhetoric, and since the December 2012 rocket launch, all expectations were that North Korea would follow its previous pattern of behavior and carry out a nuclear test.  To that end, South Korea's Yonhap News referenced  South Korean intelligence sources in reporting that North Korea had completed technical preparations for a nuclear test.  Thus, the nuclear test and belligerent threats against the United States  and South Korea were, in many senses, not surprising reactions from North Korea.  The decision to brand the United Nations Security Council an impartial entity and walk away from multilateral talks was perhaps the more unexpected path taken by Pyongyang, since China -- North Korea's closest ally -- is a veto-wielding member of that body. But  by the end of January 2013, North Korea took its rhetoric to another level when it promised action at an even ""higher level"" than a nuclear test.  The position of the North Korean leadership was reported in the Rodong Sinmun state newspaper as follows:  ""It is the people's demand that we should do something, not just a nuclear test, but something even greater. The U.N. Security Council has left us no room for choice."" This bellicose language continued in February 2013 when  Pyongyang again threatened ""stronger measures""  than simply a third nuclear test in response to ""hostile"" sanctions by the international community.  A statement by North Korea's state news agency read as follows: ""The DPRK (Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea, or North Korea) has drawn a final conclusion that it will have to take a measure stronger than a nuclear test to cope with the hostile forces nuclear war moves that have become ever more undisguised.""  There was no indication as to what form those ""stronger measures"" might entail although there was some suggestion that North Korea might use enriched weapons grade uranium, rather than plutonium,  in an explosion of some sort. The use of uranium  could indicate North Korea's intent to expand its nuclear arsenal through uranium enrichment.   It would also incur a high level of risk.  As noted by  Siegfried Hecker, former director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico  and a professor at Stanford University in California, in  Foreign Policy magazine: ""If a next test is well contained, then we may learn nothing about the device. However, one of the risks Pyongyang takes in trying to demonstrate a test at a higher level is that they may produce fissures that allow radioactive seepage or possibly cause a major blowout from the tunnel."" North Korea's bellicose language was matched with provocative visual imagery.  At issue was the release of a  three-minute video on YouTube depicting a North Korean man's dream sequence in which the city of New York is destroyed, with the 1985 song ""We are the world"" playing in the background.   A caption, which was translated from Korean in The Guardian newspaper, reads as follows: ""Somewhere in the United States, black clouds of smoke are billowing.  It seems that the nest of wickedness is ablaze with the fire started by itself.""   It continues:  ""Despite attempts by imperialists to isolate and crush us … never will anyone be able to stop the people marching towards a final victory."" The video was reported to have been released by  North Korea's state-run media and while of amateur quality in some regards, it nonetheless represented a sharp threat against the United States and/or the interests of its allies. Two dates that North Korea might be considering for a nuclear test were Feb. 16, 2013, the birthday of former leader, Kim Jong-il, or Feb. 25, 2013, the inauguration date of Park Geun-hye of South Korea. North Korea's third nuclear test On Feb. 12, 2013, seismic activity in North Korea suggested that officials may have selected an even earlier date to go forward with a third nuclear test.  The seismic shock activity emanated from the same area where North Korea had conducted its 2006 and 2009 nuclear tests. Kim Min-seok of the South Korean Defense Ministry indicated that country's belief, saying, ""We believe that North Korea has conducted a nuclear test.""  Meanwhile, the United States Geological Survey indirectly confirmed that the test had taken place as it noted the shock appeared to be one kilometer underground and was consistent with a nuclear blast.  According to Lassina Zerbo, the director of the international data center of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test Ban Treaty Organization, the magnitude of the test was twice as large as the 2009 nuclear test.  It should be noted that initial reports suggested the use of  plutonium in this nuclear test, which tends to be suited for use as a missile warhead. North Korea itself soon confirmed that it had carried out  its third underground nuclear test, which it said involved a ""miniaturized"" nuclear device. As reported in a statement by the state-run  KCNA news agency: ""It was confirmed that the nuclear test that was carried out at a high level in a safe and perfect manner using a miniaturized and lighter nuclear device with greater explosive force than previously did not pose any negative impact on the surrounding ecological environment."" North Korea claimed its third nuclear test  was an act of self-defense against ""U.S. hostility"" and warned that further  moves might be in the offing.  Via the state-controlled KCNA news agency, Pyongyang claimed  that the nuclear test  ""was only the first response"" taken ""with maximum restraint.""  Pyongyang warned that further actions were in the offing, saying: ""If the United States continues to come out with hostility and complicates the situation, we will be forced to take stronger, second and third responses in consecutive steps."" International Response The chorus of condemnation from the international community was broad and vociferous. United Nations  Secretary General Ban Ki-moon wasted no time in condemning North Korea's nuclear test, which he emphasized was a ""clear and grave violation"" of United Nations resolutions. NATO cast the nuclear test as an ""irresponsible act"" that posed a serious threat to world peace.  Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov demanded that North Korea  abandon its nuclear program and return to the negotiating table. China, North Korea's closest ally, demanded an audience with the North Korean ambassador in Beijing, while Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi said China was ""strongly dissatisfied and resolutely opposed"" to the nuclear test.   Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe declared the nuclear test to be a ""grave threat"" and vowed that it could not be tolerated.  In a statement, United States President Barack Obama argued for a swift response, asserting: ""The danger posed by North Korea's threatening activities warrants further swift and credible action by the international community. The United States will also continue to take steps necessary to defend ourselves and our allies.""  But perhaps the most scathing response came from Denmark's  Foreign Minister Villy Sovndal, who said: ""This [nuclear test] deserves only one thing and that is a one-sided condemnation.  North Korea is likely the most horrible country on this planet."" The United Nations Security Council convened an emergency meeting later on Feb. 12, 2013 to discuss future measures. During that meeting, the permanent and rotating member nations of the United Nations Security Council  unanimously condemned North Korea's latest nuclear test and warned that ""appropriate measures"" would be in the offing. Clearly, North Korea would be faced with the prospects of international action.  Even its closest ally, China, via its state-controlled media, had urged North Korea not to go forward with such a provocative action  and warned that North Korea would pay a ""heavy price""  if it proceeded with the test.  Of course, in the realm of international jurisprudence, heavy costs have come in the form of harsh sanctions by the United Nations Security Council, which have done little to curtail North Korea from going forward with its missile  program and nuclear development agenda.  Indeed, the very existence of sanctions has not stopped North Korea from repeatedly violating the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Belligerence and Brinkmanship North Korea's lack of concern for international opinion was displayed in high relief when the state-controlled newspaper declared the country's need for intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).  Only two days after carrying out  its third nuclear test, North Korea displayed its brazen stance by declaring that it should own ICBMs since the  ""imperialists""  -- an apparent reference to the United States -- had a nuclear arsenal. According to a review in Rodong Sinmun, North Korea's main newspaper and an apparent mouthpiece for the North Korean government --  the country required ICBMs to augment its self-defense.  The article in Rodong Sinmun also declared that North Korea would be a formidable enemy in the face of adversity or any challenge, and warned that there ""can be no compromise in the last fight to herald the victory for independence for humanity.""  The diatribe also included the promise to  ""strike a blow to end imperialism."" The North Koreans' efforts to develop  ICBM capacity were apparently  not being undertaken in isolation. According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, there  were suggestions that the Iranians might be assisting the North Koreans with the development of a rocket program.  Blog 38  at Johns Hopkins University noted that its analysis of satellite imagery taken in early 2013 showed that  preparations were being made for an impending test of a liquid-fueled rocket.  That satellite imagery  further showed that North Korea could conceivably test rockets larger than the size of the rocket deployed in late 2012 from a new launch pad.  As stated in the report published in Blog 38: ""Analysis of construction activities around the new launch pad has revealed evidence that Pyongyang's rocket program may be receiving assistance from Iran."" Since Iran was already ensconced its its own controversial nuclear development program -- to the great consternation of the international community -- the news of a possible connection between Pyongyang and Tehran was being  met with alarm across the world.  Indeed, there was a growing sense of anxiety about global security as a result.  That being said, the general consensus was that North Korea had not, to date,  developed the ability to deploy a nuclear warhead on an ICBM. In the last week of February 2013, researchers at Johns Hopkins University -- via  Blog 38 -- said that satellite imagery of the nuclear test facility show possible signs of human activity there, even after the third nuclear test.  They suggested that North Korea might be preparing for a fourth nuclear test.  As stated in Blog 38: ""It remains unclear whether renewed activity at the site is normal for the days after a nuclear detonation or if it is an indication of Pyongyang's intention to conduct another test in the near future.""  Sources from the Chinese government suggested that Pyongyang was waiting for possible action from the United Nations Security Council  before it makes a decision on   a fourth nuclear test. Consequences With news circulating in the first week of March 2013  that a draft  of a United Nations Security Council resolution against North Korea had been crafted, Pyongyang wasted little time in registering its anger.  On March 5, 2013, North Korea warned that it would end its 1953 armistice (ceasefire) that brought a conclusion to the conflict with South Korea, without officially ending the Korean War.  North Korea also demanded that the United States and South Korea end its ongoing military drills in the region, referring to them as a ""dangerous nuclear war targeted at us.""  Furthermore, the Korean People's Army warned that it would carry out stronger actions  in response to the ""hostile"" policies of the United States and South Korea. It was apparent that North Korea was prepared to take an aggressive stance in the face of international pressure. On March 7, 2013, the United Nations Security Council unanimous adopted Resolution 2094 censuring North Korea for its February  nuclear test and imposing an even stricter sanctions regime on that country.   Included in those new sanctions were provisions to target the financing sources of North Korea's nuclear and missile technology, but there were additional penalties imposed on North Korea in the realm of banking, travel, transportation,  and trade. As stated by United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Susan Rice, ""The strength, breadth and severity of these sanctions will raise the cost to North Korea of its illicit nuclear program. Taken together, these sanctions will bite and bite hard.""  South Korea's Ambassador to the United Nations, Kim Sook, said the time had come for North Korea to ""wake up from its delusion"" of becoming a nuclear state. He continued, ""It can either take the right path toward a bright future and prosperity, or it can take a bad road toward further and deeper isolation and eventual self-destruction.""  Meanwhile,  United Nations  Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the unanimous adoption of the resolution delivered a strong message to North Korea that its pursuit of nuclear weapons would not be tolerated by the international community. In  addition to scrapping its non-aggression agreements with South Korea, North Korea responded to the news of international action by saying that it would be  cutting off the North-South hot-line. Installed in 1971, the hot-line was created to provide direct communication at  times of increased tensions and also to organize the transfer of persons and goods through the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone.  Clearly, the disabling of the hot-line was not only symbolic of the breakdown in bilateral relations between the two Koreas, there were also practical and security implications. It should be noted that North Korea has also shockingly threatened to  launch pre-emptive nuclear attacks on the United States and South Korea in response to the joint military drills, which it said were proof of the United States' intent to go to war.  A belligerent North Korea said via its Foreign Ministry that the United Nations' action would ""compel"" that country to take ""countermeasures"" in short order.    Furthermore, it declared in a statement: ""Now that the U.S. is set to light a fuse for a nuclear war, the revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK will exercise the right to a pre-emptive nuclear attack to destroy the strongholds of the aggressors and to defend the supreme interests of the country."" North Korea even threatened to transform   Washington and Seoul into ""a sea in flames"" with ""lighter and smaller nukes."" For its part, South Korea was undeterred and moving forward with the very joint military drills (with the United States) that earned outrage and threats from Pyongyang. Still, South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se said on March 11, 2013, that his country would try to re-engage with North Korea with an eye on shifting the climate from tension and threats to cooperation. In an address, Yun said his goal was to ""turn this era of confrontation and mistrust into an era of trust and cooperation with North Korea.""  Yun further asserted: ""The security situation on the Korean Peninsula for now is very grave as the unpredictability surrounding North Korea is rising following its third nuclear test."" Escalating Tensions As March 2013 was drawing to a close, North Korea increased its belligerent rhetoric and said that missile and artillery units were combat-ready and aimed at United States and South Korean targets.  In a statement broadcast on the  state-controlled Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), the Korean People's Army's Supreme Command said: ""From this moment, the Supreme Command puts all of its field artillery including strategic rocket units and long-range artillery units into the No. 1 combat ready  posture.""  The statement further delineated targets in South Korea and the United States -- from its military installations in the Pacific to Hawaii and the mainland.  Indeed, a North Korean spokesperson was on the record saying, ""The U.S. should not forget that the Anderson Air Force Base on Guam, where B-52s take off, and naval bases in Japan proper and Okinawa, where nuclear-powered submarines are launched, are within the striking range of [North Korea's] precision strike means.""  North Korea said that its motivation was driven by the priority ""to safeguard our sovereignty and the highest dignity [of leader Kim Jong Un] through military actions."" The United States responded with its own statement as follows: ""North Korea's bellicose rhetoric and threats follow a pattern designed to raise tensions and intimidate others. While the United Nations Command, Combined Forces Command and U.S. Forces Korea continue to maintain the armistice, North Korea continues its provocative behavior and rhetoric. The Republic of Korea-U.S. alliance is strong and we remain committed to the defense of [South Korea]."" Then, on March 30, 2013, North Korea declared it was in a ""state of war"" with South Korea and that its the long-standing truce with the South had ended.  A statement from Pyongyang read as follows: ""From this time on, the North-South relations will be entering the state of war and all issues raised between the North and South will be handled accordingly. The long-standing situation of the Korean peninsula being neither at peace nor at war is finally over.""   In response, the South Korean defense ministry denounced the war threat and issued its own statement, which read as follows: ""Our military is maintaining full preparedness to leave no blind point in safeguarding the lives and safety of the people.""  As well, South Korean President Park Geun-hye noted that her country was taking the  threats from North Korea ""very seriously.""  She said, ""If there is any provocation against South Korea and its people, there should be a strong response in initial combat without any political considerations."" For its part, the United States military command in South Korea dispatched a statement that read as follows:  ""North Korea will achieve nothing by threats or provocations, which will only further isolate North Korea and undermine international efforts to ensure peace and stability in Northeast Asia."" Matching its words  with concrete illustrations, the United States was also displaying its military versatility by deploying B-2 and B-52 planes with nuclear capabilities over South Korea, while also flying F-22 Raptor fighter jets from Japan to South Korea's Osan Air base. As well, as noted below, the United States said it would deploy additional ballistic-missile interceptors along the country's Pacific Coast, with an eye on protecting the United States from a potential attack from North Korea.  As well, the United States  moved its  sea-based  X-Band radar platform, normally based in Hawaii, closer to the North Korean coast, with the intent of monitoring  potential attempts from North Korea to launch a long-range missile.  By April 2013, the United States  additionally decided to deploy an anti-missile system to Guam. Tensions on the Korean Peninsular escalated on April 2, 2013 when  the state-controlled Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) of the North Korea announced that it would be re-opening its main nuclear complex at Yongbyon and restarting its nuclear reactor there. The Yongbyon complex was home to both a uranium enrichment facility and a nuclear reactor; it  was closed as a part of a 2007 agreement between North Korea and a multilateral cadre, including China and the United States.  The agreement mandated the closure of the reactor at Yongbyon  in lieu of one million metric tons of heavy fuel oil as well as humanitarian aid benefits.   The agreement was only really in effect for a couple of years since  North Korea resumed the reprocessing of  fuel rods stored at the site in 2009, complaining that it did not receive the desired level of energy assistance. This 2013 decision to open the Yongbyon complex and restart operations of the nuclear reactor was illustrative of  the intensification of dissonance on the Korean peninsular ongoing since late 2012.  But it was also a disturbing development as it showed that the new leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un, was prepared to take increasingly provocative actions.  As a result, the international community was now regarding the paranoid and alienated nation state of nuclearized North Korea through the valence of anxiety. Reflecting this sentiment, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he was ""deeply dismayed"" by North Korea's decision to re-open the main nuclear complex at Yongbyon and restart the nuclear reactor.  He further condemned the provocative actions declaring: ""The current crisis has already gone too far. Nuclear threats are not a game. Aggressive rhetoric and military posturing only result in counter-actions, and fuel fear and instability."" Secretary General Ban urged all partied to engage in urgent talks as  ""the only way to resolve the current crisis."" However, with North Korea cutting off its military hot-line with South Korea, canceling its armistice with that country,  using the rhetoric of war, and re-opening its Yongbyon facility, it seemed that authorities in Pyongyang were not in the mood for productive diplomatic engagement. Indeed, a day later on April 3, 2013,  North Korea has ceased border crossing access for South Koreans into the jointly-administered Kaesong industrial zone. Since Kaesong has been viewed as a tacit symbol of the state of geopolitical relations and the last significant arena of cooperation between the two Koreas, the cessation of cross-border access at the industrial zone was regarded as a disturbing development. By April 4, 2013, the state-controlled Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said the military had ""ratified"" an attack on United States interests.  The KCNA statement further noted that North Korean troops had been authorized to counteract American aggression with ""powerful practical military counteractions,"" including nuclear weapons, and involving ""cutting-edge smaller, lighter, and diversified nuclear strike means.""  The KCNA statement included the following warning: ""The moment of explosion is approaching fast. No one can say a war will break out in Korea or not and whether it will break out today or tomorrow.""  The expressed nuclear threat was the most blatant and belligerent exposition from the North Korean regime on global stability in recent memory.  Raising the  threat to another level, Pyongyang also told foreign embassies that it could not guarantee their safety in the event of conflict. In a speech to the National Defense University in Washington, United States Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel noted that the recent actions of the North Koreans ""present a real and clear danger.""  Meanwhile, Russian  foreign ministry spokesperson, Alexander Lukashevich, observed that North Korea's actions may very well foreclose the notion of multilateral negotiations .  He cast Pyongyang's attempts to violate decisions of the United Nations Security Council"" as  ""categorically unacceptable,"" and issued the following warning: ""This radically complicates, if it doesn't in practice shut off, the prospects for resuming six-party talks."" On April 5, 2013, Western officials were confirming reports that North Korea had moved a medium-range missile, known as a Musudan or Nodong B, to its east coast. It was unknown if the move was to be interpreted as a threatening gesture , with a warhead mounted on the missile, or part of the preparations for test firing.  There was growing suspicion  that North Korea might, in fact, be preparing to carry out yet another missile test. It should be noted that while this Musudan/Nodong B missile has a range of around 3,000 kilometers (1,875 miles), which would put all of South Korea, Japan, and possibly the United States' territory of Guam in its range; however, there was no test history to ensure precision. As noted by  Greg Thielmann, a senior fellow at the Arms Control Association,  ""A missile that has never even had a flight test is not an operational system and is not a credible threat."" Of course,  a missile launch might be in the offing for the purpose of acquiring that test history. By April 10, 2013, South Korean sources said that North Korea appeared to be preparing to launch the Musudan mid-range ballistic missile that had been moved to the east coast, and warned that North Korea might even be preparing the fire the Musudan simultaneously with shorter range Nodong and Scud missiles.  The missiles launch could conceivably coincide with the celebration of the birthday of Kim Il-sung, the country's founder. Meanwhile, the rhetoric from North Korea continued to be bellicose with North Korean state media asserting that the scenario on the  Korean Peninsula situation was ""inching close to a thermonuclear war,""  and authorities in Pyongyang warning foreign nationals in  South Korea to evacuate from that country.  The Obama administration in the United States, via White House spokesperson, Jay Carney, characterized North Korea's statements as ""unhelpful.""  Carney continued, ""This kind of rhetoric will only further isolate North Korea from the international community and we continue to urge the North Korean leadership to heed President Obama's call to choose the path of peace and to come into compliance with its international obligations."" It should be noted that the foreign ministers of the so-called G-8 countries -- the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy,  Canada, Japan, and Russia -- have condemned North Korea's recent actions, and warned of consequences in North Korea conducts either a missile launch or a nuclear test.  On April 12, 2013, United States Secretary of State John Kerry traveled to South Korea and accentuated this multilateral warning, saying ""If Kim Jong-Un decides to launch a missile, whether it is across the Sea of Japan or some other direction, he will be choosing willfully to ignore the entire international community."" A day later, Secretary of State Kerry  met with Chinese leaders to find ways to end the geopolitical crisis brewing on the Korean peninsular.  Following that meeting, Secretary Kerry said that the United States and China were both calling for North Korea to refrain from further provocative actions. It was clear that the international community was united in its stance against North Korea's recent acts of dangerous provocation. Secretary of State John Kerry ended his Asian trip with a call for negotiations to end the dissonance and emphasizing the imperative of finding  a diplomatic solution. He said, ""The United States remains open to authentic and credible negotiations on denuclearization, but the burden is on Pyongyang. North Korea must take meaningful steps to show that it will honor commitments it has already made, and it has to observe laws and the norms of international behavior."" Meanwhile, with an eye on decreasing the tensions between the two Koreas, South Korean President Park Geun-hye called for peaceful dialogue.  But North  Korea was quick to reject the overture, characterizing the offer of talks as a  ""cunning ploy.""  If that response was any indication, North Korea remained defiant in the face of international pressure. Latest Developments April 15, 2013 -- the  anniversary of North Korea's founder's birth -- passed fairly quietly, without a continuation of the bellicose war threats and even free of a huge military parade showcasing North Korean military might.  The hopes that North Korea might be digesting the call for talks, and that the heated geopolitical climate had cooled for the moment, dissipated as Pyongyang issued new threats of war.  A statement via state-controlled media was issued as follows: ""Our retaliatory action will start without any notice from now."" It should be noted that South Korea  responded to the recent actions of North Korea by deploying two warships with  the Aegis missile defense systems on the east and west coasts.  As well, Japan deployed missile defense systems around Tokyo to defend against any missile threat by North Korea. In an interview with NBC News broadcast on April 16, 2013, United States President Barack Obama said that while the intelligence available does not suggest that North Korea has the ability to successfully arm a ballistic missile with nuclear warheads, he yet believed his country needed to be prepared for all possibilities.  He said,  ""Based on our current intelligence assessments we do not think that they have that capacity. But we have to make sure that we are dealing with every contingency out there.  That's why I repositioned missile defense systems: to guard against any miscalculation on their part."" Asked whether he believed the  North Korean leader, Kim Jung-Un, was mentally unstable, President Obama responded, ""I'm not a psychiatrist. And I don't know the leader of North Korea.""   However, President Obama characterized  North Korea's exposition of bellicose and vituperative war rhetoric as being similar to a childish tantrum, and unlikely to yield productive results.  He said, ""You don't get to bang your spoon on the table and somehow you get your way."" President Obama seemed cognizant of the fact that the impasse was unlikely to end easily, although he did not foreclose the possibility of a diplomatic resolution.  He mused, ""All of us would anticipate that North Korea will probably make more provocative moves over the next several weeks... This is the same kind of pattern that we saw his father engage in, and his grandfather before that. If they want to rejoin the community of nations, that path is available to them."" On April 18, 2013, North Korea's National Defense Commission issued a statement via the official Korean Central News Agency, demanding that the United States and South Korea withdraw ""all nuclear war making capabilities from the region,"" with an eye on future dialogue.  North Korea also called for  Washington and Seoul to apologize for its  aggression. In response, a spokesperson for the  White House, Josh Earnest,  said that the Obama administration was committed to denuclearization of the Korean peninsular and was open to ""authentic and credible negotiations.""  Earnest noted that the  actions and rhetoric from North Korea ""actually indicate the opposite.""  He added, ""We also need to see some clear evidence that the North Koreans themselves are willing to live up to their international obligations, are willing to demonstrate their commitment to ending the nuclear program, something they've promised in the past."" By April 21, 2013, North Korea was reported to have moved  two short-range missile launchers to the east coast.  According to a South Korean military source in a report by the South Korean Yonhap news agency, satellite imagery showed the transfer of  two mobile missile launchers suitable for short-range Scud missiles to the South Hamgyeong province.  Earlier in the month, as noted above, two mid-range Musudan missiles were  place on launchers on the east coast.  Collectively, these actions indicated that a missile launch might be in the offing -- possibly to mark the  anniversary of the founding of the North Korean military on April 25.  However, that date passed without any show of force. In the last week of April 2013, South Korea called on North Korea to engage in  dialogue over the Kaesong industrial complex, which became a flashpoint in the ongoing crisis between the two Koreas.  Regarded as a symbol of cooperation between North Korea and South Korea, the decision by the North to block access to the jointly-run industrial complex was interpreted as a clear sign of deteriorating relations, devolving diplomacy,  and the slide towards confrontation.  That slide became more precipitous when  North Korea outright rejected the invitation to engage in  talks.  South Korea, therefore, responded by withdrawing its nationals from the  Kaesong industrial zone in the interests of safety. On May 6, 2013,  CBS News reported that the two Musudan medium-range missiles, which had been moved to the east coast of North Korea weeks prior, were now removed from the launch site. Those missiles, as discussed above,  had sufficient range to reach Japan as well as the United States territory of Guam in the Pacific. The movement of the missiles was being interpreted in some circles as a cooling of the heated tensions on the Korean Peninsular. Of course, with the start of the spring farming season, it was also possible that many members of the army were -- as they do each year --  necessarily turning their attention to the planting effort. Regardless of the rationale, the removal of the Musudan missiles from the launch site conceivably indicated that the threat posed by North Korea was reduced at this time, if only on a temporary basis.  Indeed, since the Musudan is a mobile missile, it could well be transported back to the launch site in short order.  As noted by a senior United States official from the National Security Council in an interview with BBC News, it was ""premature to celebrate it as good news,"" given North Korea's record of unpredictable behavior to date. Striking a similar tone, George Little, a Pentagon spokesperson,  characterized North Korea's most recent stance as ""a provocation pause."" May 2013 saw North Korea carry out a series of short-range missile tests from its east coast.  As global leaders attempted to bring down the level of tensions on the Korean Peninsular,  and even after North Korea pulled back its two medium range missiles from its launch pad, the firing of four -- albeit short range -- missiles was being regarded as a provocation.  It was not known if North Korea was trying to re-ignite geo-political tensions or if the tests were routine exercises intended to simply show military might. Regardless, United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon  urged North Korea to refrain from carrying out any further missile tests and ""resume dialogue."" Presumably in an effort to show that the United States was fully prepared to defend itself from the potential nuclear missile threat posed by North Korea or any other belligerent nation state, the Missile Defense Agency along with the United States Navy on May 16, 2013  completed a successful test of a missile defense system as it destroyed a target launched in the Pacific Ocean.  According to reports from the  Department of Defense, a short-range ballistic missile target was launched  from the Pacific Missile Range Facility on the Hawaiian island of Kauai;  the USS Lake Erie was able to  detect and track the missile, then launch a blocking missile with a kinetic warhead, which successfully destroyed the target.  United States officials said the test operation in Hawaii demonstrated that the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense system was fully functional. Negotiations Planned and Canceled On June 6, 2013, North Korea proposed convening talks with South Korea over the jointly-administered Kaesong industrial zone, which had been shut down months earlier amidst heightened tensions.  The proposal  also included a provision to restart tours at the Mount Kumgang resort, which was suspended when a South Korea tourist was shot by a North Korean guard in 2008. In regards to the more recent closure of the industrial complex,  more than 50,000 North Korean workers at Kaesong were withdrawn and South Koreans and supplies were banned entry as part of North Korea's illustration that it was in a ""state of war"" with South Korea.  As intimated above in the ""Background"" note, the Kaesong complex has often been viewed as a symbol of cross-border cooperation between the two Koreas and its closure augured negatively as regards the overall geo-political security on the Korean Peninsular. But with North Korea's Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea offering the overture of dialogue on Kaeosong and Mount Kumgang,  it was believed that an effort was being made to de-escalate tensions and move to a more constructive footing. North Korea's Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea issued the following statement outlining its proposal of dialogue: ""We propose holding talks between authorities of the North and South for the normalization of operations at Kaesong and the resumption of tours to Mount Kumgang on the occasion of the anniversary of the June 15 joint declaration.""  South Korea's Ministry of Unification, which administers inter-Korean affairs, said the government in Seoul was ""considering the proposal in a positive light."" Earlier, South Korea made it clear that given the precipitous and dangerous decline in bilateral relations during the first part of 2013, it would not only consider government level engagement with North Korea. One day later on June 7, 2013, South Korea accepted North Korea's offer of bilateral talks but insisted that rather than have them take place in the  North Korean border town of Kaesong, that the dialogue site be in the  truce village of Panmunjom in the demilitarized zone between the countries.  South Korea also  noted that it was interested in taking up a range of issues, including the Kaesong Industrial Complex, the tourist center at Mount Kumgang, and the notion of family reunions.  The North reacted to South Korea's stance in a rare show of cordiality  asserting the following via a statement: ""We appreciate the fact that the South side promptly and positively responded to the proposal made by us for holding talks between the authorities of both sides."" It should be noted that the North Korean government in Pyongyang also said that if Seoul accepted its proposal, it would also re-establish the emergency hotline channels, which were severed earlier in the year, as noted above. But optimism about diplomatic progress between the two Koreas plummeted on June 11, 2013, when despite the fact that preliminary talks on technical and administrative details were reported to have gone smoothly.  By June 13, 2013, more details emerged related to the cancellation of the negotiations.  The cause was attributed to the composition of the respective delegations at the negotiating table in the first ministerial level talks since 2007. Originally, South Korean Unification Minister Ryoo Kihl-jae was slated to lead South Korea's delegation.  When South Korea requested that North Korea send Kim Yang-gon, an adviser to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un,  to the talks, North Korea declined.  Seoul then decided to dispatch  Vice-Unification Minister Kim Nam-shik to lead its delegation instead.  North Korea took offense to the apparent ""downgraded"" level of South Korean officials present  at the talks  and decided to withdraw completely.  North Korea placed the blame on South Korea for ""arrogant obstruction"" and ""deliberate disturbance"" resulting in the aborted negotiations.  North Korea further characterized South Korea's decision to change the composition of its delegation in this manner as ""the height of discourtesy and disrespect unprecedented in the history of the North-South dialogue"". For its part, South Korea  said it was disappointed with North Korea's response.  South Korea also made it clear that  it would not be offering to participate in negotiations with North Korea at any point in the near future.  As noted by South Korean Prime Minister Chung Hong-won: ""In the past, we have made infinite concessions to the North, but the time has come to hold talks where both sides are represented by officials of the same level."" At the start of July 2013, relations between the two Koreas seemed to be moving in a more productive direction when North Korea agreed to hold talks on the Kaesong industrial complex, only hours after South Korea suggested  the meeting.  It was hoped that this overture would end more positively than the situation in June 2013 when the proposed Kaesong discussions were halted over procedural disagreements, as discussed just above.  However, as of mid-July 2013, there was no immediate agreement reached on resuming operations at their joint Kaesong industrial complex. With relations between the two Koreas at a stalemate of sorts in mid-June 2013 (subsequently improved in early July 2013, as discussed above), it came as something of a surprise when North Korea proposed direct talks with the United States.  North Korea's  National Defense Commission, headed by North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un, said it hoped for ""serious discussions... to secure peace and stability.""  The United States responded to this overture by saying it looked towards  ""credible negotiations,"" made clear that North Korea had to be compliant with United Nations resolutions and travel down the path of denuclearization.   At the start of July 2013, North Korea renewed its push for engagement with the United States when Choi Myung-nam, an international affairs director at the North Korean Foreign Ministry, said Washington should take Pyongyang's diplomatic offers seriously. It should be noted that while representatives of the United States and North Korea have held meetings sporadically, the two sides have not  engaged in high-level talks since 2009. Meanwhile, in the third week of June 2013, North Korea was apparently building on its sudden appetite for diplomatic engagement as it expressed an interest in restarting international nuclear negotiations.  According to  China's foreign ministry, North Korean officials were now indicating that they wanted to ""peacefully resolve the nuclear issue.""  It should be noted that multilateral talks between North Korea, South Korea, China, Japan, Russia, and the United States over North Korea's controversial nuclear program collapsed in 2008.  North Korea's renewed interest in diplomatic engagement at the multilateral level came as a result of high-level strategic talks with Chinese officials in Beijing. It was to be seen if an actual return to the multilateral negotiating table was in the offing. In mid-August 2013,  the two Koreas were  able to successfully reach an agreement to re-open the jointly-administered Kaesong industrial complex.  The accord between the two countries included a provision ensuring that Pyongyang would never again shut the industrial complex -- often viewed as a symbol of cross-border cooperation --  ""under any circumstances.""  Another key provision of the accord was the move to  ""internationalize"" the Kaesong industrial complex by hosting foreign visitors at the factory park. This element would effectively make it harder for  North Korea to take any unilateral action involving the facility.  Left unspecified at the time was a precise date for the reopening of the facility and the resumption of regular operations. By September 2013  the two Koreas agreed on a ""trial"" start date of Sept. 16, 2013.  It should be noted that agreement was also forged in regard to exempting South Korean firms from taxes for the rest of 2013  to offset losses incurred during the period of months when the complex was closed.  Agreement was also made to facilitate easier access to the complex for South Koreans carrying out commercial responsibilities, and for the purpose of attracting foreign investors to the Kaesong Industrial Complex. Nuclear site activity -- In mid-2013, despite the overtures of diplomatic engagement to the United States, and a stated interest in returning to multilateral talks, satellite imagery depicting a North Korean test site indicated possible preparations for a possible test of a nuclear device in the future.  Researchers at John Hopkins University's North Korean Blog 38 Forum reported that satellite imagery of the Punggye-ri nuclear test site showed that some construction was being carried out the site where  North Korea conducted nuclear tests in 2009 and 2013. Researchers at John Hopkins University said: ""This activity appears to have begun by late April 2013 and gathered momentum over the next few months.""  While there was no conclusive sense of what the increased activity at the Punggye-ri nuclear test site really meant, the researchers suggested that the construction could simply be a matter of repairs, or preparations for a future test.  As stated in the Blog 37: ""These activities do not appear to be part of preparations for a nuclear test in the near-term. Rather, they seem to be long-term projects ... that may be necessary for the conduct of future tests."" In September 2013,  signs pointed to the fact that operations were being restarted at North Korea's Yongbyon reactor.  Of note was the fact that white steam was seen rising from the Yongbyon nuclear facility.  According to the Blog 38 North website of the United States-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University, the color and volume of the steam signaled that the reactor was getting close to being operational.  The blog entry read as follows: ""The white coloration and volume are consistent with steam being vented because the electrical generating system is about to come online, indicating that the reactor is in or nearing operation,"" said the Washington-based institute.""  It seemed that regardless of calming of tensions, North Korea was going forward with the threat made in April 2013 about re-opening its Yongbyon facility. As stated by Jeffrey Lewis of Blog 38 in an interview with BBC News, ""The reactor looks like it either is or will within a matter of days be fully operational, and as soon as that happens, it will start producing plutonium."" He continued, ""They really are putting themselves in a position to increase the amount of material they have for nuclear weapons, which I think gives them a little bit of leverage in negotiations, and adds a sense of urgency on our part.""   Still, that sense of urgency was a relative one with the Institution for Science and International Security issuing a report in which it would yet take time before North Korea could use new plutonium in nuclear weapons.  The institute's report issued the following finding: ""Given that North Korea will likely need two-three years before it discharges irradiated fuel containing plutonium and another six to 12 months to separate the plutonium, there remains time to negotiate a shutdown of the reactor before North Korea can use any of this new plutonium in nuclear weapons."" *** Note:  See below for  information on North Korea's nuclear test history, nuclear capability, and the United States' reaction to the threat posed by North Korea to its national security. *** Special Report: North Korean ship carrying Cuban weapons intercepted by Panamanian authorities An international imbroglio was in the making in mid-July 2013 when a North Korean ship carrying Cuban weapons was intercepted by Panamanian authorities. According to  Panamanian President Ricardo Martinelli, the ship was targeted by drug enforcement officials as it  traveled from Cuba and approached the Panama Canal. Of concern to the Panamanian authorities was the fact that the ship disappeared from satellite tracking systems after it left the Caribbean side of the Panama Canal. This situation raised the suspicions of Panamanian authorities who wondered why the ship's crew would de-activate the tracking system that conveys details of the vessel's location. As stated by Panamanian President Ricardo Martinelli, ""We had suspected this ship, which was coming from Cuba and headed to North Korea, might have drugs aboard so it was brought into port for search and inspection."" When the vessel, Chong Chon Gang, was taken into port and subject to search and inspection, its  cargo of suspected missiles was uncovered. Of note was the fact that the weapons were discovered amidst a shipment of sugar. The drama in the Panama Canal reached new heights, according to Panamanian President Martinelli, when the North Korean ship captain had a heart attack and tried to commit suicide, while a riot involving the ship's crew of 35 ensued.  The entire crew was subsequently taken into custody while the vessel and its shipments were seized. As well, President  Martinelli posted an image via his Twitter account depicting a large green object inside a cargo container, which he characterized as the suspected ""sophisticated missile equipment.""  Soon after the fracas unfolded, Cuba admitted that this stash of weapons was included in its shipment of 10,000 tonnes of sugar to North Korea.  Cuba explained that the weapons were obsolete Soviet-era arms from Cuba  being sent for repair in North Korea.  That explanation was plausible since North Korea possesses some expertise in the weapons arena. However, Panama called on the United Nations to lead an inquiry into the weapons materials to determine precisely what was stashed in the shipment. Under the aegis of prevailing  United Nations sanctions, the transportation of all weapons to or from North Korea is prohibited.  Moreover, even a benign matter such as the transportation of weapons for repair to North Korea  would, nonetheless,  require a waiver from the United Nations Security Council.  It would seem that no such waiver was procured by Cuba or North Korea. As well, regulations pertaining to the transfer of shipments through the Panama Canal required the declaration of military cargo, including  so-called ""obsolete"" weapons. Thus, an investigation into the matter was  underway, while the North Korean crew was faced with the prospect of charges of illegal weapons smuggling in Panama. As noted by President Martinelli, ""The world needs to sit up and take note: you cannot go around shipping undeclared weapons of war through the Panama Canal."" It should be noted that North Korea issued a demand that its ship be returned and the crew of the Chong Chon Gang be released.  Panama was not acquiescing to this demand and, instead, was moving forward with the aforementioned investigation. By the close of July 2013, woes for Cuba and North Korea over the infamous ship carrying weapons cargo only increased.  At issue was the report by Panamanian authorities that four new undeclared containers were found aboard the  Chong Chon Gang, quite likely in  violation of United Nations sanctions.  That determination, however, was yet to be made. In February 2014 ,  Panama had released the  Chong Chon Gang and the  ship's owner was forced to pay a fine totalling almost $700,000 for violating navigation regulations (specifically those attending to the transporation of weapons).  As well,  three crew members were facing weapons trafficking charges, although the charges against the other 32 crew members were dropped.  At issue for the Panamanian government was the fact that the weapons  being smuggled were not ""obsolete defensive weapons"" as claimed by Cuba, but in fact several sophisticated weapons in perfect condition.  Indeed, it was soon revealed that the stash of weapons included two MiG-21 aircraft, 15 MiG engines and nine anti-aircraft missiles. A preliminary report  by a panel of experts to the Sanctions Committee at the United Nations Security Council concluded that the Chong Chon Gang  violated prevailing United Nations sanctions against North Korea, which ban the transfer of weapons to that country.   Yet to be determined would be the type of penalties the United Nations Security Council would levy against Cuba.  Special Entry: North Korean leader Kim Jong-un executes uncle referring to Chang Song-thaek as a ""traitor"" -- In December 2013, Chang Song-thaek -- the uncle of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un -- was removed from his top military post as  the vice-chairman of the  National Defense Commission.  South Korean media reported that in addition to Chang's dismissal, two of his close aides were also executed for corruption.  Less than a week after the news broke about Chang's dismissal,  the official Korean Central News Agency took the unprecedented step in this secretive and hermetic country of announcing that a military trial had been held and Chang had been put to death.  Chang  was branded both a ""traitor"" and ""human scum,"" and executed for ""acts of treachery.""  The state media went the extra mile by detailing those acts of treachery.  During his military trial, Chang supposedly admitted that he attempting to overthrow the state via the formation of his own  reformist faction or ""little kingdom.""  A central element of Chang's agenda, according to the state, was a scheme to drive the economy into  ""an uncontrollable catastrophe.""  According to the official report, which was cited in the North Korean state media: ""Chang dreamed such a foolish dream that once he seizes power by a base method, his despicable true colors as a reformist would be  known to the outside world  and would help his new government get recognized by foreign countries in a short span of time."" Clearly, if such a plan was really part of Chang's agenda, it had not ended successfully and the man at the center was now eliminated.   At the level of political strategy,  the removal of Chang from a position of power, followed by  his quick military trial and execution  marked the most significant signs of political upheaval in North Korea  since Kim Jong-un succeeded his father -- the late Kim Jong-il -- as the leader of the paranoid and secretive North Korean nation state.  Chang has, in the past, been subject to political ""purges"" in  North Korea.  Despite being elected to the Central Committee of North Korea's Korean Workers' Party (KWP) in 1992, he disappeared from the public purview in 2004 with speculation abounding that he was under house arrest.  There were additional rumors that he was sent to a ""re-education"" camp.  Chang re-emerged in 2006 and has since he regarded as an economic reformer and an ally to Kim Jong-un. His dismissal was  viewed, at the time, as a major shake-up on the North Korean political scene.  Clearly, his execution signified an even more shocking shift on the North Korean landscape.  Since the position of the vice-chairman of the  National Defense Commission has long been regarded as the ""second in command"" position to the supreme leader, Chang's removal and execution was likely to create a seismic shift in the power hierarchy of North Korea.  Indeed, Kim Jong-un was  making his mark on the political structure and making it clear that he had full  control  and absolute authority over  the North Korean state.  Kim Jong-un  was further warning would-be antagonists, reformists, and dissenters that the price for disloyalty would be death.   The White House in the United States reacted to the news of Chang's execution by with the following statement: ""If confirmed, this is another example of the extreme brutality of the North Korean regime. We are following developments in North Korea closely and consulting with our allies and partners in the region."" Special Entry: Satellite photos indicate North Korea producing fuel rods for nuclear reactor at Yongbyon -- On Dec. 24, 2013, the United States-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University in Washington D.C. reported that satellite imagery indicated that North Korea was producing fuel rods for its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon.  Months earlier in September 2013,  amidst progress on the diplomatic front as the two Koreas agreed to re-open operations at the jointly-administered Kaesong industrial complex, there was retrenchment on the matter of North Korea's nuclear program.  There were indications that operations were being restarted at North Korea's Yongbyon reactor. Of note was the fact that white steam was seen rising from the Yongbyon nuclear facility.   According to the Blog 38 North website of the United States-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University, the color and volume of the steam signaled that the reactor was getting close to being operational.  The blog entry read as follows: ""The white coloration and volume are consistent with steam being vented because the electrical generating system is about to come online, indicating that the reactor is in or nearing operation,"" said the Washington-based institute.""  It seemed that regardless of calming of tensions, North Korea was going forward with the threat made in April 2013 about re-opening its Yongbyon facility. As stated by Jeffrey Lewis of Blog 38 in an interview with BBC News in September 2013, ""The reactor looks like it either is or will within a matter of days be fully operational, and as soon as that happens, it will start producing plutonium."" He continued, ""They really are putting themselves in a position to increase the amount of material they have for nuclear weapons, which I think gives them a little bit of leverage in negotiations, and adds a sense of urgency on our part.""    Still, that sense of urgency was a relative one with the Institution for Science and International Security issuing a report in which it would yet take time before North Korea could use new plutonium in nuclear weapons.  The institute's report issued the following finding: ""Given that North Korea will likely need two-three years before it discharges irradiated fuel containing plutonium and another six to 12 months to separate the plutonium, there remains time to negotiate a shutdown of the reactor before North Korea can use any of this new plutonium in nuclear weapons."" But as of late December 2013, clearly no ""shutdown"" of the reactor was in the immediate offing.  Instead, the United States-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University was  reporting that satellite imagery showed that North Korea was producing fuel rods for its Yongbyon nuclear reactor.  The United States-Korea Institute  further concluded that one building at Yonbyon had been renovated to produce fresh fuel rods for the reactor, which appeared to be operational.  As well, another building was identified which could be used to produce fuel for a light-water reactor.   Via the Blog 38 North website, the United States-Korea Institute offered the following  assessment: ""The identification of these facilities indicates a more wide-ranging, extensive effort by North Korea to modernize and restart the Yongbyon complex."" The institute continued, ""Based on this analysis, it appears the North Koreans anticipated that future requirement before 2009 and knew the lead times required to produce the necessary fresh fuel. Once international inspectors were expelled in 2009, they moved forward with the renovation of the main pilot plant building as part of what was likely their contingency plan for reactivation."" The ""good news"" for neighboring countries anxious about a nuclear-armed North Korea was the belief that Pyongyang holds possession of only 25 percent of the fuel rods necessary for the reactor to reach full power. Special Entry North Korea and South Korea exchange fire following North Korean threat of another nuclear test On Feb. 27, 2014, North Korea fired four short-range missiles over the sea off its eastern coast -- essentially to the north of the border with South Korea. The South Korea Yonhap News Agency speculated that the missiles were Scud short-range missiles with a  capacity of traversing 125 miles and thus capable of reaching targets in South Korea but not as far as Japan. On March 2, 2014, North Korea fired another two short-range missiles into the sea off the eastern coast of the Korean peninsula.  The South Korea Yonhap news Agency reported that the missiles likely flew about 300 miles and were believed to be  Scud-C models -- this time capable of reaching targets in both South Korea and Japan. In the third week of March 2014, North Korea fired  a series of 30 short-range rockets into the sea off the eastern end of the Korean peninsula. The rockets were thought to be Soviet-era FROG rockets that have been in North Korea's possession since the 1960s, and seemingly flew for more than 35 miles before landing in the sea.  This launch of the 30 FROG missiles came after other such missile tests in the weeks prior, as discussed above. In the last week of March 2014, North Korea test fired two medium range Nodong missiles, which landed in the ocean between North Korea and Japan.  The action essentially triggered a condemnation from the United Nations Security Council, which noted that the missile launches were a violation of prevailing United Nations resolutions, such as  Security Council Resolutions 1718  and  1874 that prohibit North Korea from carrying out ballistic or nuclear activity.  The United Nations Security Council also warned  of an ""appropriate response"" to come.  Undeterred, North Korea lashed back at the United Nations Security Council, characterizing its condemnation as  ""absolutely intolerable"" and justifying its own action as being a ""self-defensive"" move. There were suggestions that North Korea was reacting to the  annual joint military exercises by United States and South Korean forces, which Pyongyang typically characterizes as acts of war and aggression.  Fueling the fire for North Korea was the flight of a United States nuclear-capable B-52 bomber  over South Korea.  South Korean authorities have put forth the theory that North Korea's missile launched constituted an ""armed protest"" against the joint South Korean-United States military drills that were taking place. Perhaps exasperated by North Korea's provocative acts and  saber rattling, which were manifest most recently by the missile launches, China had already entered the equation.  Even before the launch of the medium range missiles in the last week of March 2014,  China hard earlier  declared a ""red line,"" saying that it would not allow  war or chaos on  the Korean peninsula, and  asserting that peace was possible only  via  denuclearization. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi was on the record saying, ""The Korean peninsula is right on China's doorstep. We have a red line, that is, we will not allow war or instability on the Korean peninsula."" Wang demanded that  all parties  ""exercise restraint"" and noted that ""genuine and lasting peace"" on the Korean peninsula was only possible with denuclearization.  He said, ""Confrontation can only bring tension, and war can only cause disaster.""  The Chinese foreign minister also endorsed the resumption of multilateral nuclear talks, saying, ""Some dialogue is better than none, and better early than later."" This stance by China -- North Korea's most  important diplomatic and economic supporter -- suggested that Beijing was no longer willing to accept Pyongyang's theatrics on its doorstep.   Pressure on North Korea had already begun to intensify a month earlier in February 2014 when the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, urged global powers  to refer North Korea to the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court following a report that documented horrific crimes against humanity in that country.   While China was unlikely to join the human rights chorus against North Korea, it certainly seemed prepared to use its influence to compel  North Korea to return to the nuclear negotiating table.  Adding to the suggestion that dialogue might be at hand, Japan and North Korea were scheduled to engage in their first high level talks in years. However, the nuclear negotiating table appeared to be a distant notion as March 2014 came to a close, and as North Korea threatened to go forward with a nuclear test.  As reported by the North Korean Central News Agency, North Korea said it would not foreclose the possibility of testing a ""new form"" nuclear weapon in defiance of international condemnation and in contravention of prevailing international law. While Pyongyang did not specify the type of nuclear weaponry it intended to test, the conventional wisdom has long been  held that North Korea was attempting to develop small and sophisticated nuclear devices that could be delivered by intercontinental ballistic missiles. South Korea warned that if its neighbor to the north went forward with a nuclear test, there would be consequences in the offing.  As noted by South Korea Foreign Ministry spokesman Cho Tae-young, ""North Korea should bear in mind that if it ignores the stern demand from the neighboring countries and the international community and carries out a nuclear test, it will have to pay a price for it."" On March 31, 2014, tensions on the Korean peninsula exponentially increased as North Korea and South Korea exchanged fire across its western maritime border. According to South Korean authorities, this exchange of fire was presaged by North Korea's announcement that it would hold ""live fire"" military drills along its border zone with South Korea.  South Korea warned that there would be immediate retaliation if any ordinance touched its jurisdiction.  North Korea then fired more than 500 artillery rounds, some 100 of which landed in South Korean territorial waters.  As promised,  the South Koreans responded by firing  more than 300 rounds into  North Korean waters and scrambling F-15s on its side of the maritime border. Known as the Northern Limit Line, the maritime border has been a well known flashpoint region between the two Koreas, and its very existence is a matter of dispute from the point of view of the North Koreans. The boundary was established after the end of the Korean War in the 1950s by the United Nations, but the line of demarcation has been accepted by North Korea.   It should be noted that North Korean artillery fire killed four South Koreans on the Yeonpyeong border island in the same disputed area in 2010.  In another egregious incident in 2010, North Korea torpedoed a South Korean warship in the disputed border region, sinking the vessel and killing 46 people.  Now, in 2014, it was again the locus of dissonance between the two Koreas as a result of the North's decision to hold military drills in this hotspot region. It was to be seen if these were actions by North Korea were aimed at improving Pyongyang's negotiating position for the future as it attempted to stave off further sanctions that were likely to come, or, if they were intended to be blatant and irrational acts of provocation.  South Korean Defence Ministry spokesperson,  Kim Min-seok, intimated that Pyongyang's actions were being motivated by both factors as he said, ""We believe the North's maritime firing is a planned provocation and an attempt to test our military's determination to defend the Northern Limit Line and to get an upper hand in South-North relations."" *** Note:  See below for  information on North Korea's nuclear test history, nuclear capability, and the United States' reaction to the threat posed by North Korea to its national security. *** Special Entry North Korea test fires missiles ahead of South Korean visit by Chinese president On July 2, 2014, North Korea fired a series of short-range rockets into the sea off its east coast. While the type of rockets could not be confirmed by South Korean sources that reported the event, they surmised that they were likely 300 mm rockets. Days earlier, North Korea fired two short range ballistic missiles.  It should be noted that while the short range rocket launch were not in violation of prevailing United Nations Security Council resolutions against North Korea, the firing of short range  ballistic missiles were, indeed, in violation of international law. The apparent display of military might by North Korea came ahead of a visit by  Chinese President Xi Jinping to South Korea.  It was not known if the test firing of missiles was intended to intimidate China, which is North Korea's only major ally and home to a own far more sophisticated military. But with China being pressured by South Korea and the West to use its influence to curb North Korea's provocative actions, and return to the negotiating table as regards its nuclear and missile program, it was possible that North Korea was delivering the message that it would not be swayed by its closest ally, especially when that ally's leader was on a formal visit to South Korea.  In truth, Chinese   President Xi Jinping  was returning the courtesy of a visit to China by South Korean President Park Geun-hye; however, it was not likely that paranoid Pyongyang would interpret the visit in the most benign manner. Note that in the second week of July 2014, Jon Pyong Ho -- a  former North Korean missile expert  who played a central role in his country's nuclear weapons and missile  programs -- died.  The news of his death occurred even as  North Korea launched a fresh volley of short-range missiles into waters off its eastern  coast.  Although Ho was sanctioned by the United Nations because of his nuclear development work, including his direction of the infamous 2006 nuclear test, he had more recently entered retirement.  As such, his death was not likely to impact North Korea's nuclear and missile development program. A state funeral was in the offing. North Korea fires three short-range rockets ahead of Pope Francis' visit to South Korea In mid-August 2014, North Korea fired three short range rockets from the port city of Wonsan; the rockets landed in the sea off the east coast of the Korean peninsula.  The incident coincided with Pope Francis' arrival in South Korea for a five day visit and ahead of scheduled joint military exercises between South Korea and the United States.  North Korea objects to those drills, charging that they are intended to prepare for war.  As such, North Korea has typically taken some sort of provocative action to protest the joint military activity.  In this case, North Korea reacted with the firing of the rockets as well as the issuance of a statement that read as follows: ""Given that the U.S. and the puppet forces of South Korea continue staging nuclear war exercises against us in particular, we will take countermeasures for self-defense which will include missile launches, nuclear tests, and all other programs.""  It was to be seen if North Korea would indeed follow up the rocket launches with nuclear tests, as indicated.  *** Note:  See below for  information on North Korea's nuclear test history, nuclear capability, and the United States' reaction to the threat posed by North Korea to its national security. *** Special Note No ""Game of Thrones"" in North Korea as Kim Jong-un returns to spotlight With North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un out of the public spotlight for several weeks, speculation began to rise in the early autumn of 2014 about his health and / or whether he remained in control of the country.  Most of the speculation  has focused on the matter of Kim Jon-un's health.  Some of the last footage of the North Korean leader indicated his leg may have been injured and thus prevented him from taking part in state activities.  Still, there were questions as to why a leg or foot injury, quite possibly caused either by gout or a broken ankle, may have kept Kim Jong-un cloistered for such an extended period of time. Accordingly, speculation was slowly moving in the direction of whether Kim Jong-un was embroiled in -- and perhaps even sidelined by --  a power struggle.   Indeed, a spate of reports emerged at the start of October 2014, ruminating as to whether the North Korean leader had been deposed in a secret coup. The absence of Kim Jong-un on Oct. 10, 2014, at the annual commemoration of the foundation of the Korean Workers Party only added to the mounting suggestions that a power shift might be underway. Of significance, according to Remco Breuker, Professor of Korean studies at Leiden University in the Netherlands, was the deployment of three leading political officers in the North Korean military to the closing ceremony of the Asian Games in South Korea. Referring to these individuals at that event, Breuker said: ""They have sent out high ranking officials before but never in the capacity of representing the supreme leader.  This may well be the first time.""  Defectors from North Korea also commented on the presence of the three leading political officers at the ceremony in South Korea, drawing attention to the fact that they were accompanied by bodyguards (a measure typically reserved for the North Korean president), and that they exhibited odd behavior (specifically, they were shown smiling, made no mention of Kim Jung-un, and delivered no letter from the North Korean leader, as is the typical practice). Meanwhile, in an interview with the publication, The Telegraph, Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor at  Waseda University in Japan, observed that a recent ban on travel passes might be a sign that either a coup had taken place or that a coup polot may have been uncovered.  Other North Korea experts have suggested that a low key power shift or transfer of power might be underway.  Still others have indicated that a battle for control -- something akin to a ""game of thrones"" -- was evolving in the isolated and secretive east Asian country.  To this end, one prevailing theory was the Kim Jung-un was removed from the leadership position.  With no obvious ""heir"" to the metaphoric ""throne,"" North Korea could possibly be governed by the Organization and Guidance Department (OGD) of the Korean Workers Party. It should be noted that some sources in North Korea have insisted that Kim Jong-un remained in ""total control"" of the country and attributed his absence from the public scene to an injury.  Likewise, the United States has said that it has not seen any signs of a transfer of power in North Korea.  United States National Security Adviser Susan Rice said in an interview with NBC News, ""Obviously we are watching very carefully what's happening in North Korea. We have not seen any indications of a transfer of power at this point in North Korea that we view as definitive but we'll continue to watch it carefully."" That guidance turned out to be true as Kim Jong-un re-emerged in the public purview on Oct. 14, 2014.  According to North Korea's state media, Kim Jong-un  visited a residential district and a science academy.  The news of these public visits ended speculation over his health as well as the rumors of a transition of power. Special Note  United States slaps sanctions on North Korea in response to alleged cyber-attack on Sony At the start of 2015, the United States imposed new sanctions on North Korea in response to an alleged cyber-attack on  Sony Pictures Entertainment.  Of note was the fact that United States sanctions against North Korea were already in place as a result of Pyongyang's provocative and dangerous nuclear program.  This new tranche of sanctions was being imposed as a retributive  measure promised by the Obama White House in response to a cyber-attack on Sony Pictures, which the United States government charged was carried out by agents of North Korea. While some cyber-experts have cast doubts on the claim that North Korea was behind the cyber-attack, the United States government has held steadfastly to that claim.  The cyber-attack on Sony Pictures began when the so-called Guardians of Peace hacked and released data from Sony's computers, exposing embarrassing electronic mail correspondence. The group soon took its attack to new heights, threatening theaters intending to screen Sony's satirical comedy, The Interview, which featured a humorous assassination plot against the leader of North Korea. Those threats caused Sony to cancel its cinema release of the movie, ultimately earning the rebuke of United States President Obama who suggested that decision by Sony was ""a mistake.""  To that end, Sony later reversed its decision and released the film in some theaters and in online formats. Meanwhile, North Korea's response to the hacking drama plaguing Sony was confusing.  Powers in that country at first praised the cyber-attack, casting it as a ""righteous deed,""  and even implying it might be the work of its own agents; later,  they denied culpability altogether.  However, as noted above, the United States made clear that it placed the blame for the Sony cyber-attack on North Korea, with Obama administration officials warning of  a ""proportional response"" in the offing. By late 2014, there was speculation that a disruption or ""blackout"" of Internet service in North Korea may have been part of the package of consequences promised by the Obama administration against North Korea.  However, the United States government refused to acknowledge whether or not it was responsible for cutting off Internet connectivity in North Korea.  By contrast, at the start of 2015, the Treasury Department in the United States was utterly forthright  when it publicly named  three entities as well as 10 North Korean government officials in its  sanctions announcement.  The United States Treasury's list of targets included  individuals working in Iran, Syria, China, Russia and Namibia. The three entities covered by the sanctions were as follows: The Reconnaissance General Bureau -- North Korea's primary intelligence organization; the Korea Mining Development Trading Corporation (Komid) -- North Korea's primary arms dealer; and Korea Tangun Trading Corporation -- a defense research  agency.  It should be noted that the targets of the new sanctions were not necessarily linked to the cyber-hacking attack on Sony Pictures.  Instead, it appeared that the United States was simply augmenting its sanctions regime already in place against North Korea.  The intent was to isolate North Korea's defense industry as a deterrent against future cyber-attacks. For his part, President Barack Obama signed an executive order on Jan. 2, 2015, officializing the sanctions, while the White House released a statement that read as follows:  ""We take seriously North Korea's attack that aimed to create destructive financial effects on a U.S. company and to threaten artists and other individuals with the goal of restricting their right to free expression. Today's actions are the first aspect of our response.""  The White House added,  ""This step reflects the ongoing commitment of the United States to hold North Korea accountable for its destabilizing, destructive and repressive actions, particularly its efforts to undermine U.S. cyber-security and intimidate U.S. businesses and artists exercising their right of freedom of speech."" Special Note North Korea launches anti-ship missiles in latest display of belligerance In the second week of February 2015, with joint military exercises looming between the United States and South Korea, North Korea launched anti-ship missiles from hoverships. North Korea's news agency  published images showing  the hoverships launching a so-called ""cutting-edge anti-ship rocket"" that would be used to secure the contested marine border with South Korea. Some observers expressed alarm over what they thought to be signs of intensifying technical abilities by North Korea and thus raising the threat level to neighboring countries.  They also suggested that the anti-missile technology may have come from either Russia or China, thus raising questions about those countries' culpability in facilitating North Korea's menacing behavior.  Still others dismissed the event as simply an act of aggression ahead of the aforementioned joint military exercises looming between the United States and South Korea.  But a third contingent of observers have suggested that the so-called advances in North Korean military capabilities were actually overblown.  Peter Singer, a strategist at the New America Foundation, said ""North Korea has a long track record of exaggerating and outright faking its military accomplishments... This is not going to disrupt the balance of power in the region."" Indeed, the use of hovercraft vessels can hardly be regarded as a cutting edge or breakthrough technology. It has been in use for some time across the world. That being said,  North Korea's use of new missiles from hoverships would still pose a threat to the region. Should they be deployed in the area of contested marine waters, the South Korean military would be compelled to respond.  As such, the chances of a situation escalating militarily remained high, making it clear that North Korea remained a regional menace. Special Note U.S. Ambassador to South Korea brutally attacked; North Korea calls the violence justified In the first week of March 2015, United States Ambassador Mark Lippert was brutally attacked by a pro-North Korean activist in the South Korean capital of Seoul.  Ambassador Lippert, who was serving as the United States envoy to South Korea, was attending a breakfast aimed at a discussion of the reunification of the two Koreas. During the breakfast, the assailant pushed Lippert onto a table and slashed his face with a knife, seriously injuring him.  The ambassador was then rushed to the hospital and endured 80 stitches and several hours of surgery to close his facial wound. South Korean doctors later said that Lippert narrowly survived the injury. The assailant was soon identified as as pro-North Korean activist,  Kim Ki-jong, who was known to authorities due to a previous attempt to attack Japanese Ambassador Toshinori Shigeie, for which he received only a suspended sentence. As well, there was a long record of Kim Ki-jong's participation in anti-American protests.   In South Korea, activists with pro-Pyongyang sensibilities are few in number; however, they hold passionate beliefs about the contribution of foreign powers to the divisions between the Koreas.    South Korean  President Park Guen-hye condemned what she cast as an ""attack on the South Korea-U.S. alliance.""  However, the incident did not reflect well on her, the South Korean government, or South Korean security authorities. Indeed, there were vital questions arising about (1) the level of security at the high-level breakfast, and (2) the fact that the assailant -- with his known history -- was not only free, but permitted to attend a diplomatic breakfast attended by high ranking officials. Meanwhile, North Korea entered the fray, lauding the act of violence and characterizing it as ""just punishment for U.S. warmongers.""  On behalf of the United States, Secretary of State John Kerry asserted that his country  would not be ""intimidated or deterred by threats or by anybody who harms any American diplomats.""  For his part, Ambassador Lippert exhibited great resilience, writing after surgery via the social media outlet, Twitter,   ""Doing well and in great spirits... Will be back ASAP to advance US-ROK [Republic of Korea] alliance!"" Special Note North Korean leader Kim Jong-un delivers harsh warning as defense chief is publicly executed for treason On May 12, 2015, reports emerged from the Korean Peninsula that North Korea's defense head,  Hyon Yong-chol, was publicly executed for treason and disloyalty to Kim Jong-un.  According to South Korean authorities, Hyon Yong-chol -- a stawart of the North Korean leader --  displeased Kim Jong-un when he fell asleep during an event and failed to execute certain instructions.  Kim Jong-un was delivering a harsh message to other officials by executing Hyon Yong-chol in a particularly gruesome manner -- specifically via  anti-aircraft gun fire in full view of an audience numbering in the  hundreds at the Kanggon Military Training Area.  The execution of Hyon Yong-chol occurred along with that of a senior military officer and followed the execution of another 15 officials weeks prior.  Among those purged were vice ministers who dared to question Kim Jong-un's policies. Of course, the most well-known person subject to execution was Kim Jong-un's own uncle, Chang Song-thaek,  two years earlier. North Korean vice premier executed for expressing discontent over Kim Jong-un's policies In the first part of August 2015, South Korea media reported that North Korean  Vice Premier Choe Yong Gon was executed by firing squad for expressing discontent over  President Kim Jong-un's foreign policy stances.   The execution of Choe Yong Gon  marked the latest manifestation in a high-level purge ordered by the North Korean leader since coming to power in 2011.  It certainly made clear that Kim Jong-un was intent on exhibiting his power and removing all dissenting voices from his inner circle. Note: These moves could, on one hand, be viewed as Kim Jong-un's consolidation of power. On the other hard, these moves signified a disturbing level of sociopathy in the exercise of absolute power -- and one likely unparalled in the global spectrum. As such, these developments were evoking concerns about North Korea's threat to international security, given that country's status as a nuclear power. Of particular concern should be the fact that North Korea -- a country in possession of  nuclear bombs -- is ruled by a  young, inexperienced,  and insecure leader willing to make impulsive and irreversible life and death decisions when his personal authority is challenged in any way.  While there was no immediate sign of instability in North Korea, Kim Jong-un's harsh hand could conceivably alienate old guard North Korean officials, many of whom were likely to wonder if they too would suffer the same fate as Hyon Yong-chol, Chang Song-thaek, and Choe Yong Gon among others.  Accordingly, the general consensus was that there was at least a remote chance of emerging turbulence in North Korea in the offing, even if the details were likely to remain elusive given the closed nature of this""hermit kingdom."" Special Note Talks between two Koreas ends in agreement to de-escalate tensions after exchange of fire and North Korean move to ""war footing"" On Aug. 20, 2015, North Korea shelled across the border, prompting South Korea to retaliate with several rounds of artillery fire.   Reports indicated that North Korea carried out the initial burst of shelling in retaliation for anti-Pyongyang rhetoric that has been broadcast on loudspeakers from South Korea.  The broadcasts have generally be regarded as a type of psychological warfare against Pyongyang and intended to counteract the North's nationalist propaganda. South Korea responded to North Korea's shelling, as noted here, by firing rounds of artillery.  North Korea did not immediately return fire, opting instead to warn South Korea to cease its broadcasts, which it viewed as a declaration of war, along the border area within 48 hours. North Korea warned that if South Korea did not heed its warning, it would take military action.  However, South Korean authorities said that the broadcasts would not be stopped, thus prompting the exchange of multiple rounds of fire -- none of which ended at this time with  any casualties. The exchange of fire came after two South Korean soldiers died in a landmine blamed on  North Korea earlier in August 2015, and before annual joint military exercises between the United States and South Korea that North Korea regularly condemns as an act of aggression. As a result of these incidents and the impending joint military exercises, tensions were now markedly intensified between the two Koreas.  Given this unstable landscape,  South Korea moved to evacuate residents from   Yeoncheon in  the western sea  border. South Korea's National Security Council was also set to convene an emergency session. Then, on Aug. 21, 2015,  in a disturbing escalation of tensions, the  North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, placed his country on ""war footing."" North Korean state media reported that after an emergency meeting of the central military commission, King Jong-un had ordered that North Korean troops be ""fully ready for any military operations at any time.""  While North Korea has often indulged in fiery militaristic rhetoric, this instance was regarded as more alarming since an exchange of fire had just taken place. On Aug. 23, 2015, South Korean President Park Geun-hye released a statement in which she said that the anti-Pyongyang broadcasts would continue unless North Korea apologized for the landmine incident that killed two South Korean soldiers.  She said, ""We need a clear apology and measures to prevent a recurrence of these provocations and tense situations. Otherwise, this government will take appropriate steps and continue loudspeaker broadcasts.""  The program of cross-border broadcasts actually ended in 2004 but resumed in recent times as a result of North Korean aggression.  It was to be seen  how North Korea would respond to the South Korean leader's demand, and if  high level bilateral talks between the two sides -- presumably with an eye on decreasing tensions -- would yield productive results.  A day later on Aug. 24, 2015, following marathon negotiations between the two Koreas in the in the so-called  ""truce village"" of Panmunjom inside the demilitarized zone (DMZ), the two Koreas released a statement indicating they had reached an agreement to de-escalate tensions.  According to the statement, North Korea expressed ""regret"" over the deaths of two South Korean soldiers in the aforementioned landmine incident, stopping just short of taking responsibility for the loss of life.  North Korea also agreed to end its war footing, which had actually commenced in earnest.  For its part, South Korea agreed to end its cross-border loudspeaker broadcasts.  Also of note was the fact that North Korea and South Korea agreed to future  discussions on a range of issues, with an eye on diffusing tensions and improving bilateral ties. The agreement could only be regarded as a positive development on the Korean peninsula, especially given the volatile personality of nuclear-armed North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un.  But Pyongyang officially applauded the agreement, with the state news agency noting that it had moved the  inter-Korean relations from a catastrophic path  on to ""the track of reconciliation and trust."" North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un, also lauded the accord between the two Koreas, calling it  ""a landmark occasion.""  On the other side of the border, South Korean President Park Geun-hye enjoyed a political boost from her handling of the North Korean crisis, according to survey data that showed a spike in her job  approval rating. Of significance was the fact that the 1950-1953 war between the two Koreas ended with an armistice and not a peace treaty . As such, any escalation of tensions or movement to military action is generally regarded with gravity and alarm by countries of the region of eastern Asia. Special Entry New activity detected at North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear site; Pyongyang confirms resumption of nuclear operations and warns of attack on U.S. -- Only weeks after North Korea and South Korea reached an agreement to tamp down cross-border hostilities, evidence of activity at North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear site was emerging.  At issue in mid-September 2015 were reports from the Johns Hopkins University's 38 North Blog, which monitors North Korea, that concluded that there was fresh activity taking place at two areas of Yongbyon -- specifically, at the 5 MWe reactor hall  and at the  Radiochemical laboratory, both of which are central sites in the  production of plutonium needed for the manufacture of nuclear weapons. Of note was satellite imagery  indicating increased movement of  vehicles  around the 5 MWe reactor hall, as evidenced by heavy tire tracks around the ground floor of the building.  The imagery depicted tracks leading to the spent-fuel receiving building where nuclear fuel enters the reprocessing facility, and others tracks around  the support building where trucks would unload their materials.  There was also imagery at the Radiochemical laboratory where plutonium is chemically separated from uranium and other radioactive materials, for the purpose of building nuclear weapons. As would be expected, the kind of activity at the  5 MWe reactor hall  and at the  Radiochemical laboratory in Yongbyon raised alarm bells across the globe.  While it remained impossible to determine whether Pyongyang was producing plutonium and  no conclusion could be drawn regarding the reason for increased  activity in Yongbyon,  the information nonetheless left the international community concerned that North Korea was increasing its weapons building capacity.  There remained a remote possibility that the activity could be due to renovations or maintenance; there was also a possibility that North Korea was replacing  contaminated equipment from the 5 MWe reactor and transporting it to the reprocessing complex for decontamination. Nevertheless, the general consensus was that Pyongyang was, more than likely,  ramping up its nuclear production and further developing its stockpile of nuclear weapons.  As noted by Director General Yukiya Amano of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), ""These [activities] appear to be broadly consistent with the DPRK's statements that it is further developing its nuclear capabilities."" On Sept. 15, 2015, Pyongyang removed all doubt about its nuclear activities, confirming that the Yongbyon nuclear site had indeed resumed operation.  The reactor at Yongbyon provided plutonium for North Korea's nuclear weapons program but was shut down in 2007.  In 2013, following North Korea's third nuclear test, the government in Pyongyang made clear that the reactor would be restarted.  Now, in 2015, it was apparent that Pyongyang was making good on that threat.   According to the state-run news agency, known by the acronym, KCNA, North Korea was aiming to increase its nuclear weapons arsenal and improve the quality of nuclear weapons in its possession. With North Korea already in possession of approximately 12 atomic bombs, nuclear weapons experts surmise that now that the reactor at Yongbyan has resumed operations, the North could conceivably produce enough plutonium for one nuclear bomb each year.  Of significance, though was the fact that those bombs were unlikely to be small enough to be fit a nuclear warhead, although there were recent claims to the contrary by Pyongyang (as discussed directly below). It should be noted that North Korea was not simply delivering the message that it was expanding its nuclear weapons stockpile.  North Korea was also making an explicit threat to use its nuclear bombs to attack enemy states; to that end, North Korea asserted that it would face hostility from the United States ""with nuclear weapons any time.""  That particular threat was to be understood along with North Korean claims that it had effectively manufactured a device small enough to fit a nuclear warhead  on a missile that presumably could be launched at the will of the leadership in  Pyongyang.   There remained, however,  skepticism regarding the North's actual progress in regard to miniaturization.   Distance is another key consideration.  As has been the case in the past, North Korea's threats to attack the United States was being interpreted in the context of the plausibility.  Could a North Korean missile actually reach American soil?  While a missile could certainly reach South Korea, there were question marks about it reaching a longer distance.  For example, the medium-range missile, known as a Musudan or Nodong B  has a range of around 3,000 kilometers (1,875 miles), which would put all of South Korea, Japan, and possibly the United States' territory of Guam in its range.  But since there was no  test history to ensure precision (an issue addressed below), such a threat had to be regarded with some skepticism.   As noted by  Greg Thielmann, a senior fellow at the Arms Control Association,  ""A missile that has never even had a flight test is not an operational system and is not a credible threat."" With this fact in mind,  the successful launch of a missile was unlikely to transpire without testing of the type that would be discernible to the entire world.  While that knowledge should ideally calm immediate anxieties about global stability,  the news that  North Korea intended to launch a rocket to transport its Songun Korea satellite into space was being received with alarm.   Typically, North Korea's  space and satellite announcements  function as a ruse for its nuclear military activities.  Specifically, North Korean claims of satellites being launched into space have long been  interpreted as euphemisms for  long-range missile tests.   North Korea has in its possession the long-range Unha rocket, which was launched into space in 2012 but billed as a satellite.  All signs pointed to a repeat test of this type --  regardless of the fact that North Korea was prohibited from conducting ballistic missile technology tests under prevailing United Nations Security Council Resolutions.   Given North Korea's record of defiance in regard to international law, there was little chance that warnings would stop Pyongyang from going down the road of a long-range missile test.  To be determined was the matter of whether or not North Korea's rocket technology was sufficiently advanced as to be able to strike Hawaii or the western coast of the mainland United States. With the  70th anniversary of the foundation of the ruling Workers Party in the offing, this collective news about North Korea's nuclear activity and ambitions sparked the anxiety of the world, which was now bracing for another provocative act by Pyongyang. Special Report:   North Korea underlines role as global security pariah with long range missile test on the heels of alleged hydrogen bomb test In January 2016, North Korea claimed to have successfully carried out  its first underground test of a hydrogen bomb at its Punggye-ri nuclear site.  A significant 5.1 magnitude tremor was detected in the region, with monitors quickly noting that it was not caused by natural seismic activity.  Pyongyang soon released a statement via state media, which declared: ""The republic's first hydrogen bomb test has been successfully performed at 10:00 am on Jan. 6, 2016.""  North Korean state media went on to make claims about the development in strident propaganda-laced language, as  it added:  ""People of the DPRK are making a giant stride, performing eye-catching miracles and exploits day by day."" It should be noted that a hydrogen bomb test would indicate a marked augmentation of North Korea's nuclear capabilities, were it to be confirmed.  However, nuclear experts quickly discounted North Korea's claim, pointing to the fact that the blast was not large enough to be an actual thermonuclear explosion.   In an interview with BBC News,  James Acton,  one of the directors of the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said of the blast, ""It tentatively appears too small to be a hydrogen bomb.""  Likewise, in an interview with international media, Bruce Bennett, a defense analyst with the Rand Corporation, made the following observation:  ""The bang they should have gotten would have been 10 times greater than what they're claiming.""  Bennet also noted that if a full thermonuclear device was utilized by North Korea, the blast should have generated a seismic measurement of ""around seven on the earthquake scale."" The general consensus seemed to be that North Korea had not tested a  genuine thermonuclear device, but very  likely utilized modifications and tested a boosted fission device.  But North Korea had also claimed that its device was miniaturized.  It should be noted that there was little information available to either prove or disprove North Korea's miniaturization claims.  That aspect could potentially be alarming for the global community since a nuclear device needs to be small enough to be fitted onto a missile for delivery purposes (vis a vis ground launchers which would have a more limited delivery capability). A hydrogen bomb should be distinguished from an atomic bomb as the former uses fusion technology and would be capable of far more damage and decimation that an atomic bomb, which uses fission technology.    Of course, it should be noted that even an atomic bomb would be capable of catastrophic destruction, as evidenced by the horrific effects of the atomic bombs that struck the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II.   Since then, the very threat of any country using a nuclear bomb has been the most pressing global security concern, which guides international policy-making. The Obama administration in the United States wasted no time in casting doubt on North Korea's claim of  a successful hydrogen bomb test.   While State Department spokesperson,  John Kirby, said, ""The U.S. government judges North Korea to have conducted a nuclear test yesterday,""  he indicated that  analysis indicated that the test was not actually that of  a hydrogen bomb.   White House spokesperson,  Josh Earnest,  emphasized that his country had no reason to change its view of the threat posed by North Korea.  Indeed, he essentially suggested that there was no reason to believe that North Korea actually had made notable strides in nuclear technology to the extent that it was now capable of producing and testing a hydrogen bomb.  He said,  ""Nothing that has occurred in the last 24 hours has caused the United States government to change our assessment of North Korea's technical and military capabilities."" Even if the test was not that of a true hydrogen bomb, it would nevertheless mark the fourth nuclear test carried out by North Korea since 2006 and could only be understood as a blatant act of defiance,  a flagrant violation of existing United Nations Security Council Resolutions against North Korea, and a grave threat to global security. There was no shortage of condemnation from the international community.  United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon characterized North Korea's latest nuclear test  as ""deeply troubling"" and warned that it was ""profoundly destabilizing for regional security.""  Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said that the nuclear test  also constituted a violation of international law, as he added, ""This test once again violates numerous Security Council resolutions despite the united call by the international community to cease such activities."" South Korea blasted North Korea for  challenging global peace and violating international law.  Japan's government said the test was a threat to Japan and could not be tolerated.   Russia's ambassador to the United Nations, Vitaly Churkin, said that his country was hoping that  ""cool heads"" would prevail  and that Russia would recommend a ""proportionate response"" to the nuclear test.   China -- North Korea's closest ally -- said that it ""firmly opposed"" the test and noted that it occurred ""irrespective of the international community's opposition."" Precisely because of its position as North Korea's closest ally, all eyes were on China, hoping that country could make progress communicating with the difficult North Korean regime.   However, China seemed to sidestep that responsibility, with its Foreign Ministry simply urging North Korea to adhere to its denuclearization promises and avoiding further provocative action.  A statement from that ministry read as follows: ""Achieving denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and safeguarding the peninsula's peace and stability accords with all parties' mutual interests, is the responsibility of all parties, and requires all parties to put forth efforts.""  The United States reacted to that statement by urging China to relinquish its ""business as usual"" relationship with North Korea and with United States Secretary of State John Kerry making the following statement in a news conference:  ""China had a particular approach that it wanted to make, that we agreed and respected to give them space to implement that,"" Kerry told reporters after the phone call. ""Today, in my conversation with the Chinese, I made it very clear that has not worked and we cannot continue business as usual."" Not surprisingly, the broader international community made clear that North Korea would suffer consequences.  To this end, the United Nations Security Council issued a condemnation of North Korea, excoriating that country for being  ""a clear threat to international peace and security"" and saying  it would prepare a new tranche of punitive measures to be levied against North Korea for its latest act of belligerence.  Those news punitive measures would very likely come in the form of a new Security Council resolution.  That action was strongly backed by Japan, with the Japanese ambassador to the United Nations, Motohide Yoshikawa, saying,  ""The authority and credibility of the Security Council will be put in question if it does not take these measures.""   In an address to the United Nations Security Council, United States Ambassador  Samantha Power urged the body to impose ""a tough, comprehensive, and credible package of new sanctions,"" and  to ensure ""rigorous enforcement of the resolutions it has already adopted."" Meanwhile, individual countries were wasting no time in taking unilateral action against North Korea.  At the top of the list of those countries was South Korea, which vowed that it would resume its frontier broadcasts of propaganda to the North in retaliation for its latest nuclear test.  It should be noted that the broadcasts have been the source of grave tensions between the two Koreas, leading to the deterioration of already-dismal ties between the two countries in recent times.    South Korea also increased in military readiness,  raised in cyber attack alert level, and canceled tours of the  Demilitarized Zone on the border.  Cho Tae-yong, a South Korean national security official,  warned that his country was ready to react to further provocations and acts of belligerence by the North as he said, ""Our military is at a state of full readiness, and if North Korea wages provocation, there will be firm punishment."" As one of South Korea's closest allies, the United States deployed a  B-52 bomber to be flown over South Korea as  a show of force.   There was also some speculation about the deployment of an aircraft carrier to the Korean peninsula, according to South Korea's Yonhap News Agency; however, no further details were available at the time of writing... For its part,  North Korea increased its troop deployments in front-line units along the border with South Korea.   Moreover, North Korea appeared undeterred by international condemnation.  Indeed, North Korean leader, King Jong-un,  called for his country to expand its  nuclear arsenal.  As reported in the state-controlled media, ""(Kim) called for bolstering up both in quality and quantity the nuclear force capable of making nuclear strikes at the U.S.-led imperialists any time and in any space ... if they encroach upon the sovereignty of the DPRK and make threatening provocations.""  State media in North Korea noted that Kin Jong-un had called   the ""detonation of more powerful H-bomb in the future."" This alarming statement from North Korea  motivated  South Korean President Park Geun-hye to state that ""provocations"" by the North should result not simply in new sanctions, but in fact  tougher measures than before.  She said,  ""We are cooperating closely with the United States and allies to come up with effective sanctions that will make North Korea feel bone-numbing pain, not only at the Security Council but also bilaterally and multilaterally.""  The South Korean president also urged China to use its influence with North Korea productively as she said, ""I am certain that China is very well aware if such a strong will isn't followed by necessary steps, we will not be able to stop the North's fifth and sixth nuclear tests and we cannot guarantee true peace and stability."" In the United States, there was no patience to wait for coordinated multilateral action.  In a rare moment of bipartisanship, the   House of Representatives voted decisively to pass legislation intended to expand punitive sanctions against North Korea. It should be noted that even as the nuclear experts and global powers dismissed North Korea's claims of carrying out a hydrogen test,  the United States was also dismissing an earlier claim by North Korea that he had fired a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM).   At issue was videotaped footage released by North Korea presumably intended to support its claim that its ballistic missile technology was sufficiently developed so as to launch a nuclear warhead from a submarine. According to North Korea, the submarine test took place in December 2015; however, analysis from experts indicated that the videotaped footage may have been  doctored.  According to the South Korea's military, the video  was very likely edited with Scud missile footage from 2014.  Likewise, experts at the  James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS) in California in the United States concluded that the footage was heavily modified.   John Schilling from the 38 North Korea monitoring website at John Hopkins University went further in noting that the footage actually indicated a failed launch and thus suggested that North Korea was not making as much technological progress in this realm as claimed.  He said, ""The failed launch, combined with testing from a barge shows that North Korea still has a long way to go to develop this system.""  He added, ""An initial operational capability of a North Korean ballistic-missile submarine is not expected before 2020."" On Feb. 7, 2016, only weeks after its alleged hydrogen bomb test, North Korea again violated prevailing United Nations Security Resolutions and carried out a long range rocket test.   North Korea  issued a statement in which it claimed that a new Earth observation satellite, the Kwangmyongsong-4, was sent using an Unha launch vehicle from the Sohae space center in North Phyongan province and placed into orbit.  According to Pyongyang, the rocket launch was for the peaceful purpose of placing a satellite into orbit; however, typically, Pyongyang makes this type of claim in order to mask the fact that it was actually testing ballistic missile technology.  Such long range missile tests are typically understood as ways of trying to refine its ability to target an enemy nation with a nuclear bomb using ballistic missile delivery systems.  Of significance was the fact that the first stage of the rocket was prepared in such as way as to self-destruct after separation, and thus limit the ability of foreign powers to analyze the rocket debris. That being said, the rocket's second stage was thought to have landed in the marine waters close to Luzon Island in  the Philippines -- more than 2,00  kilometers away from  its North Korean launch pad.  That distance would undoubtedly worry foreign powers, which would use their capabilities to try to locate the second stage rocket debris.  At the same time,  defense officials in the United States have disputed North Korea's claim of a successful satellite launch,  noting that in fact the device was actually  ""tumbling in orbit"" and  not capable of meaningful function.  Nevertheless,  even an unsuccessful launch of a rocket into space would provide North Korea with the opportunity to test the reliability of its rocket systems.  That alone would grant North Korea technological insight.  Moreover, the fact that North Korea had carried out the test in defiance of international law set off alarm bells across the globe.   Given the threat posed by North Korea in the aftermath of such provocative activity in 2016, United States officials made clear that they would accelerate plans to  implement a missile defense system. Meanwhile, as was the case following the alleged hydrogen test, the United Nations Security Council reacted with a vociferous condemnation and again threatened to move forward with new punitive sanctions. But a tone of frustration appeared to come from Japan, whose envoy to the United Nations, Motohide Yoshikawa, complained that the Security Council's existing sanctions had  ""not stopped North Korea from developing nuclear weapons.""  As such,  the Japanese envoy demanded tougher measures against North Korea.  United States Ambassador Samantha Power appeared to concur, as she declared,  ""There can be no business as usual.""  The truth of the matter was that , as before, China appeared to have little appetite to move in that direction. Note on deteriorating relations between the two Koreas Relations on the Korean peninsula deteriorated in the period in early 2016 when North Korea carried out a hydrogen bomb test and launched a satellite into space, the latter of which was generally regarded as a ruse for a ballistic missile test.   The two actions were regarded as virulent acts of provocation, committed in flagrant contravention of international law,  and thus constituted a threat to regional -- if not global -- security, .    Tensions on the Korean peninsula deteriorated further in February 2016 when South Korea decided to suspend operations at the  Kaesong industrial zone, which has been jointly administered by the two Koreas and viewed as a venue for cooperation.  South Korea made the move in response to North Korea's provocative and belligerent actions, as noted just above.  But North Korea itself reacted by evicting all South Koreans from the   Kaesong industrial zone  and accusing South Korea of effectively ""declaring war.""   The Democratic People's Republic of Korea's (DPRK)   Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea released a statement that read as follows: ""Unpardonable is the puppet group's act of totally suspending the operation in (Kaesong), finding fault with the DPRK's H-bomb test and launch of a satellite."" United States says it rejected peace treaty proposal by North Korea because it did not include denuclearization provisions In February 2016, the United States Department of State said that it had recently  rejected a peace treaty proposal by North Korea because it did not include provisions for  denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula.  in response to a question posed during a Wall Street Journal interview, John Kirby, the spokesperson for the United States Department of State,  acknowledged that the White House agreed to go forward with  peace talks with North Korea, which would broadly encompass many issues including North Korea's nuclear program.  However,  North Korea was not interested in peace talks that included a discussion of its nuclear arsenal, and then on Jan. 6, 2016, went forward with its claimed hydrogen bomb test.  That move effectively ended the diplomatic track.  Of significance, according to  Kirby, was the fact that North Korea initiated the contact over a proposed  peace treaty.  As noted by Kirby,  ""To be clear, it was the North Koreans who proposed discussing a peace treaty."" United States and China reach agreement on draft resolution expanding sanctions against North Korea over nuclear activities In late February 2016,  in response to North Korea's provocative nuclear activities in contravention of international law, the United States and China arrived at an agreement  intended to expand United Nations Security Council sanctions against that country.  In the aftermath of North Korea's hydrogen bomb test in January 2016,  Washington D. C. and  Beijing have been ensconced in  rigorous negotiations aimed at drafting a  draft resolution. The two sides were not in complete agreement about what types of initiatives should be undertaken,  with Beijing favoring dialogue and advocating non-proliferation, and with Washington D.C. pushing for more stringent punitive  measures, including curbs on Pyongyang's ability to access the global financial system.  Other provisions being explored included mandatory inspections on cargo passing from or to North Korea, a  ban on all supplies of aviation and rocket fuel to North Korea,  and a ban on the transfer to North Korea of any item that could be used for military purposes. Despite the distance on some of these items, Washington D. C. and  Beijing were finally able to find concurrence and craft the draft resolution, which they hoped would be introduced and  voted on in the full 15-member United Nations Security Council at the start of March 2016.  Of significance was the fact that the resolution was passed into international law. Significantly, North Korea reacted to  the Security Council resolution by casting it as a ""criminal act"" orchestrated  by the United States and vowed to continue its nuclear proliferation activities. A government spokesperson said in an interview with the state-controlled KCNA media said, ""Our response will involve the full use of various means and tools including a strong and ruthless physical response."" North Korean leader instructs military to be ready to use nuclear weapons and makes miniaturization claims; U.S. discusses missile defense shield  protection with South Korea In the first week of March 2016, North Korea's leader,  Kim Jong-un, declared that his country's nuclear weapons should be made  ready for use ""at any time"" and  in a ""pre-emptive attack"" mode.   According to state media in North Korea, King Jong-un called on the military to adjust its posture so that it could launch pre-emptive strikes upon demand.   As stated by Kim Jong-un, North Korea  ""Now is the time for us to convert our mode of military counteraction toward the enemies into a pre-emptive attack one in every aspect.""  He added that North Korea ""must always be ready to fire our nuclear warheads at any time"" due to the threat posed by the country's enemies. Kim Jong-un identified those enemies, as follows: ""At an extreme time when the Americans... are urging war and disaster on other countries and people, the only way to defend our sovereignty and right to live is to bolster our nuclear capability.""   There were some suggestions that this move by North Korea, which was accompanied by a volley of short-range missile launched into the sea, constituted a belligerent response to the tough sanctions imposed by the United Nations on North Korea for its recent provocative nuclear activities.   As is usually the case with North Korea,  the move could only mean an escalation of tensions on the Korean peninsula. The United States Pentagon reacted with the spokesperson issuing the following statement: ""We urge North Korea to refrain from provocative actions that aggravate tensions and instead focus on fulfilling its international obligations and commitments.""  As well, the United States convened talks with South Korea aimed at possibly deploying an American missile defense shield to the South Korea.  To that end, the discussion would focus on the feasibility financially and environmentally of installing the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system in South Korea, along with its effectiveness in potentially shooting down short and medium-range ballistic missiles, thus destroying incoming warheads.  Of note was the fact that the THAAD was already installed in Hawaii and Guam to protect the United States from potential attacks from North Korea. Those defense systems would be of paramount importance given North Korea's claims on March 9, 2016, that its scientists had made technological strides and developed miniaturized nuclear warheads that could be fitted on ballistic missiles.   Of significance was the fact that North Korea state media has  published photographs of Kim Jong-un  at the testing event of a multiple launch rocket system, and also posing with what was claimed to be miniaturized weapon.  It should be noted that there was no verification of North Korea's claims in these regards although the release of the images was clearly geared to proving its claims.  Kim Jong-un  indicates that North Korea will conduct nuclear warhead test In mid-March 2016 North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said his country would soon conduct a nuclear warhead test.  Kim Jong-un also indicated that North Korea would test launch ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads.    Only a week earlier North Korea announced that it had made technological strides and had developed a miniaturized warhead that could be used against the country's enemies. The news was reported by the state-controlled KCNA media service and occurred as the North Korean leader witnessed a simulated test of atmospheric re-entry of a ballistic missile intended to measure the  ""thermodynamic structural stability of newly developed heat-resisting materials.""  The KCNA report included the following assertion:  ""Declaring that a nuclear warhead explosion test and a test-fire of several kinds of ballistic rockets able to carry nuclear warheads will be conducted in a short time to further enhance the reliance of nuclear attack capability, he (Kim) instructed the relevant section to make prearrangement for them to the last detail."" Of significance was the fact that this disturbing announcement from North Korea came at a time when South Korea and the United States were carrying out  annual military exercises, and  on the heels of a series of provocative and belligerent acts in contravention of international law, including a hydrogen bomb test.  Those acts of belligerence  ultimately triggered the imposition of a tough United Nations Security Council resolution which tightened sanctions against North Korea.   Since that time, North Korea has been issuing no shortage of statements laced with heated rhetoric and threats to global security. North Korea fires ballistic missile into sea in defiance of international jurisprudence On March 18, 2016, in defiance of international jurisprudence, North Korea fired   two ballistic missiles.  Media reports indicated that they were medium-range missiles fired from mobile launchers.  One ballistic missile reportedly  traveled  about 500 miles (800 kilometers)  and landed in the sea,  while the other exploded after launch, These two medium range missile tests were capable of reaching Japan and thus raised alarms in that country.   Indeed, Japan issued a protest with North Korea, with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe saying in an address before  parliament, ""Japan strongly demands North Korea to exercise self-restraint and will take all necessary measures, such as warning and surveillance activity, to be able to respond to any situations."" Meanwhile,  the Chinese Foreign Ministry demanded that North Korea adhere to limits set forth by prevailing  United Nations  resolutions rather than provoking neighbors and increasing regional tensions. The United States Department  of State issued a similar message, as it demanded that North Korea fulfill its international  obligations. North Korea warns of famine even as it continues belligerent nuclear activities In late March 2016, amidst its continued belligerent nuclear activities,   Kin Jong-un told the people of North Korea that they should prepare for famine of the type that killed millions during the 1990s.  Via an editorial in the state-run Rodong Sinmun newspaper, the North Korean leader's message read as follows, ""The road to revolution is long and arduous. We may have to go on an arduous march, during which we will have to chew the roots of plants once again.  Even if we give up our lives, we should continue to show our loyalty to our leader, Kim Jong Un, until the end of our lives.""  It should be noted that even as Kom Jong-un prepared his people for hardship and food scarcity, he was reported to be about 300 pounds -- a testament to the ease with which he has been able to access plentiful food.   Meanwhile, there was little chance that North Korea's nuclear activities -- irrespective of their expense -- would be curbed anytime in the future.      Special Report on North Korean nuclear threat to global security   Introduction   On Sept. 9, 2016, North Korea carried out its fifth nuclear test. The event took place on the 68th anniversary of North Korea's founding.  It was the biggest blast to date and regarded as more powerful than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima.  For its part, North Korea celebrated its fifth nuclear test carried out in defiance of international law and announced that it was now capable of mounting a nuclear warhead on a medium-range ballistic missile. The international community reacted with strong condemnation to this provocation by North Korea, with the United States saying it would work with the international community -- including North Korea's closest ally, China -- to impose new sanctions.   Chronology of Developments in 2016   - North Korea claims to test hydrogen bomb in contravention of UN Security Council resolutions - North Korea establishes itself as global security pariah; makes nuclear  miniaturization claims - New assessment by South Korea: North Korea capable of placing nuclear warhead on mid-range missile - U.S. concerned North Korea may be preparing  unprecedented launch of a mobile ballistic missile - North Korea reiterates  intent to augment its nuclear weapons at rare congress of Workers Party - North Korea carries out two mid-range missile tests in defiance of international law - North Korea reports success in an apparent submarine missile launch - North Korea carries out its fifth - and largest to date - nuclear test in violation of international law - North Korea attempts intermediate missile test that ends in failure   Geopolitical security has emerged as a key concern in eastern Asia in 2016 since the start of the year when North Korea claimed to have carried out a hydrogen bomb test.   In January 2016, North Korea claimed to have successfully carried out  its first underground test of a hydrogen bomb at its Punggye-ri nuclear site Pyongyang soon released a statement via state media, which declared: ""The republic's first hydrogen bomb test has been successfully performed at 10:00 am on Jan. 6, 2016.""  It should be noted that a hydrogen bomb test would indicate a marked augmentation of North Korea's nuclear capabilities, were it to be confirmed.   A hydrogen bomb should be distinguished from an atomic bomb as the former uses fusion technology and would be capable of far more damage and decimation that an atomic bomb, which uses fission technology.    Of course, it should be noted that even an atomic bomb would be capable of catastrophic destruction, as evidenced by the horrific effects of the atomic bombs that struck the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II.   Since then, the very threat of any country using a nuclear bomb has been the most pressing global security concern, which guides international policy-making.   Even if the test was not that of a true hydrogen bomb, it would nevertheless mark the fourth nuclear test carried out by North Korea since 2006 and could only be understood as a blatant act of defiance,  a flagrant violation of existing United Nations Security Council Resolutions against North Korea, and a grave threat to global security.   The general consensus seemed to be that North Korea had not tested a  genuine thermonuclear device, but very  likely utilized modifications and tested a boosted fission device.  But North Korea had also claimed that its device was miniaturized.  It should be noted that there was little information available to either prove or disprove North Korea's miniaturization claims.  That aspect could potentially be alarming for the global community since a nuclear device needs to be small enough to be fitted onto a missile for delivery purposes (vis a vis ground launchers which would have a more limited delivery capability).   Not surprisingly, the broader international community made clear that North Korea would suffer consequences.  To this end, the United Nations Security Council issued a condemnation of North Korea, excoriating that country for being  ""a clear threat to international peace and security"" and saying  it would prepare a new tranche of punitive measures to be levied against North Korea for its latest act of belligerence.   It should be noted that even as the nuclear experts and global powers dismissed North Korea's claims of carrying out a hydrogen test,  the United States was also dismissing an earlier claim by North Korea that it had fired a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM).   At issue was videotaped footage released by North Korea presumably intended to support its claim that its ballistic missile technology was sufficiently developed so as to launch a nuclear warhead from a submarine.   According to North Korea, the submarine test took place in December 2015;

But a tone of frustration appeared to come from Japan, whose envoy to the United Nations, Motohide Yoshikawa, complained that the Security Council's existing sanctions had  ""not stopped North Korea from developing nuclear weapons.""   The imposition of a particularly punitive United Nations Security Council resolution against North Korea for these belligerent activities in defiance of prevailing dictates of international law had no effect on North Korea.  Instead,   North Korea's leader instructed the country's military to be ready to use its arsenal of nuclear weapons against ""enemies.""   To this particular end, in the first week of March 2016, North Korea's leader,  Kim Jong-un, declared that his country's nuclear weapons should be made  ready for use ""at any time"" and  in a ""pre-emptive attack"" mode.   According to state media in North Korea, King Jong-un called on the military to adjust its posture so that it could launch pre-emptive strikes upon demand.   As stated by Kim Jong-un, North Korea  ""Now is the time for us to convert our mode of military counteraction toward the enemies into a pre-emptive attack one in every aspect.""  He added that North Korea ""must always be ready to fire our nuclear warheads at any time"" due to the threat posed by the country's enemies.   Kim Jong-un identified those enemies, as follows: ""At an extreme time when the Americans... are urging war and disaster on other countries and people, the only way to defend our sovereignty and right to live is to bolster our nuclear capability.""   There were some suggestions that this move by North Korea, which was accompanied by a volley of short-range missile launched into the sea, constituted a belligerent response to the tough sanctions imposed by the United Nations on North Korea for its recent provocative nuclear activities.   As is usually the case with North Korea,  the move could only mean an escalation of tensions on the Korean peninsula. hg   The United States Pentagon reacted with the spokesperson issuing the following statement: ""We urge North Korea to refrain from provocative actions that aggravate tensions and instead focus on fulfilling its international obligations and commitments.""  As well, the United States convened talks with South Korea aimed at possibly deploying an American missile defense shield to the South Korea.  To that end, the discussion would focus on the feasibility financially and environmentally of installing the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system in South Korea, along with its effectiveness in potentially shooting down short and medium-range ballistic missiles, thus destroying incoming warheads.  Of note was the fact that the THAAD was already installed in Hawaii and Guam to protect the United States from potential attacks from North Korea.   Those defense systems would be of paramount importance given North Korea's claims on March 9, 2016, that its scientists had made technological strides and developed miniaturized nuclear warheads that could be fitted on ballistic missiles.   Of significance was the fact that North Korea state media has  published photographs of Kim Jong-un  at the testing event of a multiple launch rocket system, and also posing with what was claimed to be miniaturized weapon.  It should be noted that there was no verification of North Korea's claims in these regards although the release of the images was clearly geared to proving its claims.   By  mid-March 2016 North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said his country would soon conduct a nuclear warhead test.  Kim Jong-un also indicated that North Korea would test launch ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads.    Only a week earlier North Korea announced that it had made technological strides and had developed a miniaturized warhead that could be used against the country's enemies.   The news was reported by the state-controlled KCNA media service and occurred as the North Korean leader witnessed a simulated test of atmospheric re-entry of a ballistic missile intended to measure the  ""thermodynamic structural stability of newly developed heat-resisting materials.""  The KCNA report included the following assertion:  ""Declaring that a nuclear warhead explosion test and a test-fire of several kinds of ballistic rockets able to carry nuclear warheads will be conducted in a short time to further enhance the reliance of nuclear attack capability, he (Kim) instructed the relevant section to make prearrangement for them to the last detail.""   Of significance was the fact that this disturbing announcement from North Korea came at a time when South Korea and the United States were carrying out  annual military exercises, and  on the heels of a series of provocative and belligerent acts in contravention of international law, including a hydrogen bomb test.  Those acts of belligerence  ultimately triggered the imposition of a tough United Nations Security Council resolution which tightened sanctions against North Korea.   Since that time, North Korea has been issuing no shortage of statements laced with heated rhetoric and threats to global security.   On March 18, 2016, in defiance of international jurisprudence, North Korea fired   two ballistic missiles.  Media reports indicated that they were medium-range missiles fired from mobile launchers.  One ballistic missile reportedly  traveled  about 500 miles (800 kilometers)  and landed in the sea,  while the other exploded after launch, These two medium range missile tests were capable of reaching Japan and thus raised alarms in that country.   Indeed, Japan issued a protest with North Korea, with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe saying in an address before  parliament, ""Japan strongly demands North Korea to exercise self-restraint and will take all necessary measures, such as warning and surveillance activity, to be able to respond to any situations."" Meanwhile,  the Chinese Foreign Ministry demanded that North Korea adhere to limits set forth by prevailing  United Nations  resolutions rather than provoking neighbors and increasing regional tensions. The United States Department  of State issued a similar message, as it demanded that North Korea fulfill its international  obligations.   In late March 2016, amidst its continued belligerent nuclear activities,   Kin Jong-un told the people of North Korea that they should prepare for famine of the type that killed millions during the 1990s.  Via an editorial in the state-run Rodong Sinmun newspaper, the North Korean leader's message read as follows, ""The road to revolution is long and arduous. We may have to go on an arduous march, during which we will have to chew the roots of plants once again.  Even if we give up our lives, we should continue to show our loyalty to our leader, Kim Jong Un, until the end of our lives.""  It should be noted that even as Kim Jong-un prepared his people for hardship and food scarcity, he was reported to be about 300 pounds -- a testament to the ease with which he has been able to access plentiful food.   Meanwhile, there was little chance that North Korea's nuclear activities -- irrespective of their expense -- would be curbed anytime in the future.   At the start of April 2016, South Korean officials said that a new assessment indicated that North Korea had the capability of  mounting a nuclear warhead on a medium-range missile.  In an interview with Reuters News, a South Korean official said,  ""We believe they have accomplished miniaturization of a nuclear warhead to mount it on a Rodong missile.""  The official added, ""Whether they will fire it like that is a political decision.""   That news, if true, would bolster North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's claims a month prior that his country had developed miniaturized nuclear warheads that could be mounted on ballistic missiles.    Of note was the fact that the mid-range Rodong missile at stake in this revelation would be capable of firing a warhead for up to 1250 miles, and this place South Korea, Japan, as well as parts of China and Russia at risk.   It should be noted that there was no conclusive evidence of the assessment discussed by South Korea; still, there seemed to be a willingness to consider the risk posed by North Korea as real.  At a Pentagon briefing in the United States, Pentagon spokesperson Captain Jeff Davis said, ""We know that they've said they have that capability, and we have to take them at their word.  But we have not seen them demonstrate it, so we don't share that assessment necessarily but we do accept what they say as a threat we need to take as real.""   In mid-April 2016, the United States warned that North Korea might be making preparations for a launch of a mobile ballistic missile.  It should be noted that North Korea  had successfully launched a three-stage ballistic missile from a stationary launch pad in the past;  the launching of a  mobile ballistic missile, which could strike parts of United States territory, would be an unprecedented move.   At issue was a possibly impending launch of the mid-range Musudan missile with sufficient range to hit Guam or the edge of Shemya Island in  Alaska's Aleutian area.  Another possibility was the launch of either the longer range Kn-08 or the Kn-14 mobile ballistic missiles, which would have  longer range and could potentially hit the northwestern reaches of the mainland United States as well as Hawaii.   The viability of the Kn-08 was questionable with the Kn-14 believed to be more precise.   One central concern at this time was  the ""quick strike"" capacity of a mobile launcher.  Indeed, mobile launchers would be  difficult for  either aircraft or satellites to detect and track -- and thus repelled.  Other key concerns applied to both stationary and mobile units,  One question centered on the matter of whether North Korea actually had  miniaturized a nuclear warhead in its possession.   The United States had already expressed its decision to assume North Korea's claim in this regard was valid.  As stated by Admiral William Gortney,  the head of the United States  Northern Command, said in testimony before  Congress.""It's the prudent decision on my part to assume that he has the capability to miniaturize a nuclear weapon and put it on an ICBM."" Another question focused on whether or not experts in North Korea  had made technological advances regarding a weapon's  functionality and specifically, its viability after the heat effect during ""re-entry.""   In May 2016, North Korea convened a rare congress of its ruling Workers' Party.   The last such meeting of the Workers Party had taken place more than three decades  prior.  At that congress, North Korea reiterated its intent to augment its nuclear weapons capability in complete violation of prevailing United Nations resolutions.  Also during the meeting, Kim Jong-un adopted a new title -- this one of party chairman -- in a move aimed to  demonstrate his political power.   A statement by Pyongyang broadcast by the KCNA news service read as follows: ""We will consistently take hold on the strategic line of simultaneously pushing forward the economic construction and the building of nuclear force and boost self-defensive nuclear force both in quality and quantity as long as the imperialists persist in their nuclear threat and arbitrary practices.""   In June 2016, North Korea attempted to carry out a missile test that appeared to have ended in failure.  Then hours later, North Korea  launched what was identified as an intermediate-range Musudan missile in the direction of Japan,  which traveled approximately 250 miles before  plunging into the sea to the south of the Japanese island of Honshu.  As before, these missile tests occurred in violation of prevailing United Nations Security Council resolutions and sanctions, and thus, in contravention to international law.   Neighboring countries denounced the move while NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg condemned North Korea's provocative actions, saying: ""I strongly condemn the launch by North Korea of two ballistic missiles."" He added, ""These repeated provocative actions ... undermine international security and dialogue.""   In August 2016, an apparent submarine missile launch from the city of Sinpo was deemed to be the ""greatest success"" but North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un.  The submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) traveled 300 miles (500 km) in the direction of Japan and even breaching the Japanese defense zone waters. Experts observed that the launch demonstrated technological progress in the North Korean SLBM program.   North Korea carries out fifth nuclear test; says it can attach a miniaturized nuclear warhead for delivery via a missile   On Sept. 9, 2016, North Korea carried out its fifth nuclear test. The event took place on the 68th anniversary of North Korea's founding.  It was the biggest blast to date and regarded as more powerful than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima.   The international community reacted with strong condemnation to this provocation by North Korea, with the United States saying it would work with the international community -- including North Korea's closest ally, China -- to impose new sanctions.  United States President Barack Obama said the nuclear test was a ""grave threat to regional security and to international peace and stability,"" while warning that North Korea would suffer consequences as a result of its ""unlawful and dangerous actions.""   Also on the agenda was a discussion at the United Nations Security Council of North Korea's fifth nuclear test and possible punitive actions.   For its part, North Korea celebrated its fifth nuclear test carried out in defiance of international law and announced that it was now capable of mounting a nuclear warhead on a medium-range ballistic missile.  A statement by the state media outlet, KCNA, read as follows: ""The standardization of the nuclear warhead will enable the DPRK (acronym for Democratic People's Republic of Korea) to produce at will and as many as it wants a variety of smaller, lighter and diversified nuclear warheads of higher strike power.""   While this claim of miniaturization could not be independently verified, the nuclear test itself bolstered North Korea's test history and augmented its technological research corpus. Furthermore, it would undoubtedly serve to alarm the international community, particularly east Asian neighboring countries like South Korea and Japan.   Indeed, this fifth nuclear test by North Korea made clear that there had been little success using the existing system of global security to contain Pyongyang's defiant actions.  The reality was that the current international policy of dealing with North Korea's threat to global security was something of an dead end.   As before, the general consensus was that it would be up to China to try to influence North Korea to restrain itself from further belligerence.  Clearly, that approach had, thus far, been a failure.  While China has condemned Pyongyang for its nuclear tests and missile launches, it has also made it clear that it opposes the usual response from South Korea and the United States to the North's actions.   Typically, South Korea and the United States engage in a show of military force in the east Asia region, as a reminder of sorts to the North of possible lethal consequences.  China opposes such action, casting it as provocative in its own way.  Moreover China has been opposed to the United States' decision to deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-missile system in South Korea.  China has argued that the implementation of THAAD will not help bring the North back to negotiations, and meanwhile, it regards the system as an affront to its own national security. There is also a  prevailing anxiety by the Chinese that the collapse of North Korea would spur a refugee crisis from that country into its own terrain.   The counterpoint, of course, is that China could head off some of these concerns by consenting to a more draconian sanctions regime.  At issue was the fact that United Nations Security Council Resolution 2270 that was passed earlier in 2016 following  North Korea's fourth nuclear test included a loophole allowing Chinese imports for ""livelihood"" purposes. As such, one argument was that a stronger measure was needed to prevent the North from accessing Chinese imports of coal or limiting remittances of North Korea workers.  Such pressures -- if significant enough -- could force the North back to the negotiating table.   It was to be seen if the members of the United Nations Security Council could find concurrence on the issue and traverse this road.  The initial assessment was negative with veto-wielding China insisting that the North Korean problem could not be solved by sanctions alone, and with Russia -- another veto-wielding Security Council member, urging a ""creative"" solution instead.   In the days after North Korea's fifth nuclear test, as expected,  United States supersonic B-1 Lancer strategic bombers flew over South Korea in show of force against the North and in solidarity with the South.   By the end of September 2016, as world powers discussed conditions for the implementation of new United Nations Security Council sanctions against North Korea, the United States made it clear that its deployment of a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-missile system in South Korea  was not on the table for negotiations.  There had been suggestions that it would factor into the discussions, given China's opposition to THAAD in its ""backyard"" and given the necessity for veto-wielding China to get on board with any draft resolution  that was ultimately advanced. Also of note was the fact that Russia -- also a veto-empowered Security Council member -- had its own objections to THAAD in the region.  As with China, Russian concurrence on a future draft resolution would be required.   Note that in mid-October 2016, North Korea attempted to carry out an intermediate ballistic missile test that ended in failure.  In response, the United Nations Security Council issued a condemnation as follows: ""The members of the Security Council further regretted that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is diverting resources to the pursuit of ballistic missiles while Democratic People's Republic of Korea citizens have great unmet needs.""     North Korean agents suspected of assassinating King Jong-un's half-brother   In February 2017, it was reported that the Kim Jong Nam, the estranged half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, was murdered in Malaysia.  His female assassins were reported to have used the VX nerve agent, which is capable of rendering death within minutes and which is categorized by the United Nations as a weapon of mass destruction.     United States authorities have surmised that  Kim Jong Nam was likely eliminated by North Korean agents.  South Korean authorities made the same conclusion, suggesting that agents working for North Korea's foreign and security ministries likely carried out the assassination of Kim Jong Nam. Lee Cheol-woo, a South Korean legislator, said in an interview with Reuters News that it was ""a case  of terrorism led by the state, directly organized by the ministry of state security and the foreign ministry.""   The assumption was that Kim Jong Nam was part of a deathly purge being carried out by Kim Jong to silence any threats to his authority.  To that end, Kim Jong Nam was known to have spoken out publicly against the North Korean regime.     Special Report: Belligerence, brinkmanship, and threatening war rhetoric between United States and North Korea; is nuclear war imminent?    Synopsis   At the start of 2017, North Korea warned that it could attack enemies  ""at any time"" and blamed the United States for the development of its missile program. This announcement came on the heels of the New Year's message of North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, in which he said that his country was close to testing an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of delivering a nuclear warhead to the mainland of the United States. Then, in February 2017, ahead of a meeting between the leaders of the United States and China,  North Korea fired a ballistic missile into the Sea of Japan.     In the background of this development, United States President Donald Trump warned that the United States would act alone against North Korea if China failed to  do so. But Trump credited Chinese President Xi Jinping with working to resolve the threat emanating from Pyongyang following a meeting with  the Chinese leader. China was soon offering North Korea an incentive to back off from its nuclear activities and ambitions  by promising its protection.  However, North Korea appeared undeterred, carried out a missile launch, and promised to ""ruthlessly ravage"" the United States if it attacked North Korea. Building on that threat,  North Korea  soon warned of a nuclear attack on the United States in response to any aggression from that country, as well as regular missile testing in defiance of international law.  To that end, another ballistic missile was fired and although it ended in failure, it nonetheless demonstrated North Korea's continued defiance.     In May 2017, North Korea successfully test fired a new strategic ballistic missile named Hwasong-12 and indicated some significant advances in North Korea's intercontinental ballistic missile technology.  Of note was North Korea's technical advances in the realms of engine performance and  mastery of re-entry -- two key areas that could aid North Korea in successfully attacking the United States with a missile  mounted with a nuclear warhead. For his part, United States President Donald Trump warned of a ""major, major conflict with North Korea"" while United States lawmakers were concerned about a lack of a clear  strategy for dealing with North Korea.      As May 2017 came to an end, North Korea had fired a short range  Scud-class ballistic missile, prompting protest from Japan and warnings of consequences.     At the start of July 2017, North Korea carried out an apparent  two-stage intercontinental ballistic missile (ICMB) test.  The test was a wake up call to the United states that North Korean missiles could hit Hawaii and Alaska, and perhaps even the American mainland.  The only question was whether or not North Korea had actually developed the technology to mount miniaturized nuclear warheads on long-range missiles and if such devices could withstand re-entry.  A second ICBM test with significant range  by North Korea at the end of July 2017  underlined the clear and president danger to global security posed by that country, as well as the increasing threat to the American mainland.     In August 2017,  the United Nations imposed harsh new sanctions on North Korea  for its  latest missile aggression in violation of international law.     These measures yielded no measurable constraining effect on North Korea, which at the start of September 2017 carried out its sixth nuclear test -- this time believed to be a hydrogen bomb capable of destroying an entire city. According to Pyongyang, the hydrogen bomb was capable of fitting on an intercontinental ballistic missile and reaching the mainland United States.  Pyongyang further claimed ""perfect success"" in this hydrogen bomb test endeavor.   In the aftermath of the sixth nuclear test by North Korea, United States President Donald Trump repeatedly threatened that country with ""total destruction.""  Then, following Trump's address to the United Nations General Assembly, the North Korean foreign minister Ro Yong Ho warned that Trump aggressive rhetoric had ""lit the wick of war.""    As the year 2017 came to a close, North Korea had carried out an apparent ICBM test demonstrating a possible ability to strike the United states mainland directly. War rhetoric intensified as a result.   Note:  It should be noted that North Korea holds the dubious distinction of being the only country to have performed a nuclear test in the 21st century.   Developments in the first half of 2017 --   At the start of the second week of January 2017, North Korea declared that it could launch an intercontinental ballistic missile ""at any time"" and blamed the United States for the development of its missile program.    This announcement came on the heels of the New Year's message of North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, in which he said that his country was close to testing an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of delivering a nuclear warhead to the mainland of the United States.    In truth, experts on the matter have generally maintained the view that despite North Korea's ongoing — and alarming — progress in developing a warhead capable of being attached to a missile, there has still been insufficient  technology developed and testing done by North Korea to successfully deliver a nuclear device.  Nevertheless, North Korea was again reminding the world of its status as a pariah nation posing a global security threat.    In an interview on NBC News, Defense Secretary Ash Carter of the outgoing Obama administration made clear that while North Korea was issuing a ""serious threat,"" the United States had the capability to shoot down any missile posing a threat to the homeland.  Indeed, the United States' Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system (THAAD) has been deployed by the Obama administration to be at the ready to defend the United States homeland and its allies.     Meanwhile, North Korea released a statement that read:  ""Anyone who wants to deal with (North Korea) would be well advised to secure a new way of thinking after having a clear understanding of it.""   In this way, North Korea appeared to be signaling to the incoming Trump administration in the United States that continuing down the road of economic sanctions would prevent a return to the negotiating table.    On Feb. 12, 2017, North Korea  fired a ballistic missile from its Banghyon air base in North Pyongan province on the Korean peninsula. The missile flew east for approximately  300 miles towards the Sea of Japan but officials from Japan noted that the missile did not land in Japanese territorial waters.  Reports suggest that the missile was an intermediate range Musudan, capable of flying 2,500 miles and thus reaching the United States Pacific territory of Guam.   It was the first such act of belligerence from North Korea since the Trump administration in the United States took office, and ensued at a time when Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was in the United States to meet with President Donald trump.   Japanese officials made clear that  they would make a ""strong protest"" to North Korea over the incident.   Meanwhile, United States Defense Secretary James Mattis made clear to North Korea that any use for nuclear weapons by Pyongyang would be met with ""an effective and overwhelming"" response. Mattis also reminded the world that the United States THAAD missile defense system would be sent to South Korea, as planned.     It should be noted that the missile test was carried out in violation of prevailing United Nations  resolutions intended to stymie North Korea's nuclear activities.  To date, North Korea has continued to act in contravention to international law.    In the first week of March 2017, North Korea  launched four ballistic missiles from the Tongchang-ri region, near the border with China, and towards the Sea of Japan.     The government of Japan confirmed that three missiles fell into Japanese marine jurisdiction, prompting Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of that country to characterize North Korea's actions as a ""new stage of threat.""      This latest act of belligerence from North Korea was believed to be in reaction to Foal Eagle military exercises going on between South Korea and the United States.   It was also being watched by the international community with concern as all such missile testing would be useful to advancing  North Korean missile technology.   It should be noted that due to prevailing United Nations sanctions, North Korea  has been prohibited from carrying out any missile or nuclear tests.  As such, the test firing of the missiles was another flagrant act of defiance from Pyongyang with regard to international law.      On April 3, 2017, North Korea fired a ballistic missile from the eastern port of Sinpo into the Sea of Japan.   The United States military's Pacific Command said the missile was very likely a KN-15 medium-range ballistic missile. According to South Korean officials, the missile flew 40 miles before landing in the Sea of Japan.    Of note was the fact that the missile launch occurred ahead of a highly anticipated meeting between United States President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping.  While the issue of North Korea's nuclear program, as well its belligerent actions in violation of  international law, were topics expected to be discussed between the two leaders, the diplomatic climate was less than optimal.   Indeed,  only days before, Trump said United States would act alone against North Korea if China failed to do so.  In an interview with the Financial Times at the start of April 2017, United States President Donald Trump said that his country would ""solve"" the nuclear threat emanating from North Korea, unilaterally, if China failed to act.     Trump said, ""China has great influence over North Korea. And China will either decide to help us with North Korea, or they won't. And if they do that will be very good for China, and if they don't it won't be good for anyone.""  Trump explained, ""If China is not going to solve North Korea, we will. That is all I am telling you.""   When he was asked if he believed the United States could succeed alone at ending the nuclear threat posed by North Korea,  he replied: ""Totally.""   Trump's comments were likely to be met with alarm across the world, as they built upon a statement made by United States Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who during a  trip to Asia in March 2017, noted that pre-emptive military action was an option that remained ""on the table.""   Trump's comments came ahead of a significant bilateral meeting set to be held  with the Chinese leader,  Xi Jingping at the president's  Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.  Trump was making clear that he would to use trade as an incentive to pressure China.    To that end, in the interview with the Financial Times, Trump noted that ""trade is the incentive.""  He added, ""It is all about trade.""   It was not clear if Trump would bring up the issue directly with the Chinese leader during the meeting, or at a future occasion.  However, Trump was on the record via the social media outlet, Twitter, saying, ""The meeting next week with China will be a very difficult one in that we can no longer have massive trade deficits.""   It was unclear how China would respond to this type of pressure or if would even by productive.  While China banned North Korean coal imports — an income source for North Korea — it has been reticent to cripple Pyongyang completely, fearing that a collapse of the country and an influx of North Korean refugees flowing across the border into China.  Also of concern would be the likely unification of the two Koreas, with the South being home to a strong United States military presence.    For its part, China declined to issue anything other than a perfunctory statement about the impending meeting between Trump and Xi. In that statement by  State Councilor Yang Jiechi, Beijing made clear that the meeting between Xi  and Trump was of ""utmost importance in China-US relations"" and would be instrumental in ""promoting peace, stability and prosperity... for the whole world.""   Nevertheless, China has in the past advanced a ""double halt"" proposal that would entail North Korea's suspension of its  nuclear program, along with the simultaneous cessation of joint military exercises between the United States and South Korea.  But the United States has shown no interest in this proposal, noting that there was no equivalence between the nuclear and missile activities undertaken by North Korea in violation of international law, and  ""lawful, longstanding joint security exercises "" with South Korean allies in the region.   On April 4, 2017, in the aftermath of North Korea's latest missile launch,  United States Secretary of State Rex Tillerson characterized the move as ""yet another"" intermediate range ballistic missile.  Indeed, Tillerson refused to offer more insight, saying instead, ""The United States has spoken enough about North Korea. We have no further comment.""   A week later on April 11, 2017, North Korea warned of a nuclear strike on the United States  if it were provoked by American aggression.  North Korea said via its official Rodong Sinmun newspaper: ""Our revolutionary strong army is keenly watching every move by enemy elements with our nuclear sight focused on the U.S. invasionary bases.""   This threat by North Korea emerged after the United States announced that it was moving the aircraft carrier strike group, Carl Vinson, toward the Korean peninsula.   White House spokesperson Sean Spicer said Trump had placed North Korea ""clearly on notice"" while dismissing  Pyongyang's nuclear attack threat.  Spicer said, ""I think there is no evidence that North Korea has that capability at this time. Threatening something that you don't have the capability of isn't really a threat.""   On April 13, 2017, United States President Donald Trump said that North Korea was a problem that ""will be taken care of.""  Trump was responding to speculation that North Korea could carry out a sixth nuclear test.     Trump also appeared to credit Chinese President Xi Jinping with working to resolve the threat emanating from Pyongyang.  Trump said of the Chinese leader with whom he met at his Mar a lago resort in Florida: ""I have really gotten to like and respect President Xi. ... He's a very special man. I think he's going to try very hard.""   These remarks by Trump, should be regarded as a departure from statements made prior to his meeting with the Chinese president, in which he threatened to use trade as a pressure tactic.     For its part, China was soon offering North Korea an incentive to back off from its nuclear activities and ambitions.  Via the  state-backed Chinese newspaper, Global Times,  Beijing suggested said the best option for North Korea would be to relinquish  its nuclear program, in return for protection from China.  The Global Times editorial read as follows:    ""As soon as North Korea complies with China's declared advice and suspends nuclear activities ... China will actively work to protect the security of a denuclearized North Korean nation and regime.""  The threats from North Korea discussed below suggested that Chinese influence on Kim Jong-un's regime was limited.    Meanwhile, NBC News reported that the Trump administration was considering a  pre-emptive strike on North Korea, should it show signs of conducting another nuclear test or launching missiles to coincide with key historic anniversaries. This report raised concerns about the consequences of such pre-emptive action on global security.     Perhaps in response to these anxieties, an official from the Trump administration denied the notion of a pre-emptive strike on North Korea, calling it ""flat wrong.""  As well, the Pentagon reacted by stating that, as a policy, it would not ""publicly speculate on possible scenarios."" In an official statement, Dana White, a Pentagon spokesperson, said, ""Commanders are always considering a full range of options to protect against any contingencies."" She added, ""Our commitment to the defense of our allies, including the Republic of Korea and Japan, in the face of potential threats, remains steadfast.""   Attention was particularly trained on  North Korea's ""Day of the Sun,"" the 105th anniversary of the birth of state founder Kim Il Sung on April 15, 2017.  But a missile launch on that day ended in failure when it exploded seconds after being launched.     On April 16, 2017, United States Vice President Mike Pence traveled to South Korea and from that location warned North Korea not to provoke the Trump administration. Mike Pence said,  ""North Korea would do well not to test [Trump's] resolve.""   For his part, during an interview with Fox Business Network the previous week, Trump offered no details on his strategy against North Korea, except to say, ""We are sending an armada, very powerful.  We have submarines, very powerful, far more powerful than the aircraft carrier, that I can tell you.""     As discussed above, it had already been reported that Trump ordered the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier group to be moved in the direction of the Korean peninsula in a show of force and as a warning to Kim Jong-Un.  However, in fact, the carrier USS Carl Vinson and strike force group were headed to the Indian Ocean for joint exercises with the Australian Navy -- quite a significant distance from the Korean Peninsula.   The White House explained its misleading claims by saying that it had relied on statements from the Defense Department, although the incorrect explanation came from Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.   Undeterred by warnings from the United States or incentives from China, North Korea soon promised to ""ruthlessly ravage"" the United States if it attacked North Korea. Via North Korea's official KCNA news agency, the  military issued the following statement: ""Our toughest counteraction against the U.S. and its vassal forces will be taken in such a merciless manner as not to allow the aggressors to survive.""  As before, the Trump White House dismissed the claim, maintaining that Pyongyang was unable to carry out such a threat.   But by April 18, 2017,  North Korea  was warning of a nuclear attack on the United States in response to any aggression from that country.   Moreover, North Korea was promising "" to test missiles weekly"" in an interview with BBC News.  Vice-Foreign Minister Han Song-ryol said, ""We'll be conducting more missile tests on a weekly, monthly and yearly basis."" He also promised  an ""all-out war"" would result if the United State took military action against North Korea.  Perhaps most alarming was Han's promise to strike with a nuclear weapon as he said,  ""If the U.S. is planning a military attack against us, we will react with a nuclear pre-emptive strike by our own style and method.""   Adding to the climate of belligerence, brinkmanship, and threatening rhetoric,  United States Vice President Mike Pence again warned North Korea not to test the resolve of the United States, saying, ""The sword stands ready.""   In the last week of April 2017, the USS Carl Vinson carrier strike group was sailing towards waters close to the Korean peninsula. In response, North Korea said it was ready to sink the United States aircraft carrier in a demonstration of its military fortitude.    Also in late April 2017, a United States nuclear-powered submarine, the USS Michigan, arrived in the region for naval exercises.     Via the newspaper of the North's ruling Workers' Party, the Rodong Sinmun, the message from Pyongyang was as follows: ""Our revolutionary forces are combat-ready to sink a U.S. nuclear-powered aircraft carrier with a single strike.""   With concerns for its own security, and in response to North Korean threats, two  Japanese warships, the Samidare and Ashigara, were being sent out to join the USS Carl Vinson.  According to the Japan Maritime Self Defense Force, the two warships were set to ""practice a variety of tactics"" with the United States strike group.   On April 28, 2017, North Korea test-fired a ballistic missile in defiance of pressure from global powers, including its closest ally, China. United States sources indicated that the missile, which was launched from the Pukchang region, was quite likely a medium range KN-17. The missile launch ended in failure, disintegrating only minutes after taking off. Nonetheless, it represented continued militaristic belligerence by North Korea, and in violation of international law.  Moreover, given the North's successive launches and tests  in 2017 alone, it was fair to state that it was garnering technological insights, even in cases of failure.    Via the social media outlet, Twitter, United States President Donald Trump reacted to that   missile test by declaring: ""North Korea disrespected the wishes of China & its highly respected President when it launched, though unsuccessfully, a missile today. Bad!""   It should be noted that around the same time, in an interview with Reuters News, United States President Donald Trump acknowledged that North Korea was his biggest global challenge and presaged a possible ""major, major conflict"" with that country over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.  He said, ""There is a chance that we could end up having a major, major conflict with North Korea. Absolutely.""   Of concern was the fact that the United States' Trump administration had already made clear that all options -- including those of the military variety -- were on the table in regard to North Korea.  The reality was that any direct military strike by the United States on North Korea would inevitably yield retaliation by that country, with Japan and South Korea being the targets, and with United States military forces situated in those countries being among the casualties. That being said, Trump did note that the goal would be to resolve the North Korean crisis peacefully.    In the same interview with Reuters News, Trump had high praise for his Chinese President Xi Jinping's attempts to restrain Pyongyang. He said, ""I believe he is trying very hard. He certainly doesn't want to see turmoil and death. He doesn't want to see it. He is a good man. He is a very good man and I got to know him very well.""   Meanwhile, members of Congress in the United States were increasingly alarmed at the deepening of the North Korean crisis, given the bellicose language and provocative actions   emanating from Pyongyang, along with the hardline threats from the Trump White House.   Thus, a series of security briefings by the Trump administration for lawmakers was arranged.     One briefing was attended by all 100 senators, as well as with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, and Marine General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  A second briefing took place involving Vice President Mike Pence, Tillerson, Mattis, Coats, and Dunford, as well as the House of Representatives at a secure auditorium at the Capitol.   At the conclusion of these two exercises, several senators lamented that the Trump administration had  failed to outline any real strategy to deal with the national security threat from North Korea.  Democrats generally cast the experience as a trumped up photo opportunity. Representative Brad Sherman, a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said: ""I regard that level of resolve as very modest, weak and maybe even phony. The only way to put enough pressure on North Korea is to get China to do it.""    Republicans were somewhat kinder, with Senator Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, casting it as ""an okay briefing.""   In mid-May 2017, North Korea successfully test fired a new strategic ballistic missile named Hwasong-12 .  According to the state run KCNA news agency, the Hwasong-12 was fired  at the highest angle to avoid impacting the security of neighboring countries.  The missile flew 489 miles on a trajectory  before reaching an altitude of 1,312 miles.     An alarming consideration was the fact that if the missile was fired at a standard trajectory, it would have a range of at least 2,500 miles.   As such, this test launch indicated some significant advances in North Korea's intercontinental ballistic missile technology.  Of note was North Korea's technical advances in the realms of engine performance and  mastery of re-entry -- two key areas that could aid North Korea in successfully attacking the United States with a long-range missile  mounted with a nuclear warhead.    As May 2017 came to a close, North Korea had fired a short range  Scud-class ballistic missile in the direction of Japan, which flew about 280 miles before landing in the sea off  North Korea's east coast.  The belligerent action prompted protests from Japan wand warning of consequences to come.  In the weeks before, North Korea successfully fired two  medium-to-long-range missiles.    The number of missile launches North Korea carried out in the first part of 2017 -- nine as of the end of may 2017 -- made clear that Pyongyang was intent on defying international law.   It also suggested that North Korea was undeterred by the election of  President Moon Jae-in  in South Korea, who championed engagement with the North.      With Japan incensed that the latest missile landed within its exclusive economic jurisdiction, there was a push for measurable consequences for North Korea.  To that end, United States and Japan were looking to China for cooperation on pushing forward on a new United Nations Security Council resolution.   As before, the Trump administration was telegraphing that military action -- even war -- was on the table, should North Korea refuse to come to heel.  Asked to depict military conflict with North Korea during an interview with CBS news, United States Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, said it would be ""probably the worst kind of fighting in most people's lifetimes.""  He added, ""The North Korean regime has hundreds of artillery cannons and rocket launchers within range of one of the most densely populated cities on Earth, which is the capital of South Korea. And in the event of war, they would bring danger to China and to Russia as well.""   Meanwhile, it should be noted that United States defense officials were making clear that there was a need to  strengthen the country's missile defenses in Hawaii.  In testimony before members of Congress, Admiral Harry Harris, the leading  commander in the Pacific, said this would be needed in response to the grave threat posed by North Korea's missile and nuclear weapons programs.     While some members of Congress, along with the Trump administration spokespersons, have dismissed the notion of North Korea being able to strike United States territory as ludicrous, the fact was that Pyongyang had been extending its nuclear technology and advancing its knowledge, via its intensified test activity.     To this end, Harris noted that while defenses of Hawaii were likely sufficient at this time, there would be a need for new radar and interceptors to intercept incoming North Korean missiles in the future.  In response to one member of Congress, Harris replied, ""I don't share your confidence that North Korea is not going to attack either South Korea, or Japan, or the United States ... once they have the capability.""  Indeed, he added, ""... We need more interceptors.""   North Korean warns that it can strike the United States --   At the start of July 2017, North Korea carried out a missile test. The missile was launched from Panghyon in North Pyongan province and reached a height of 1741 feet -- the highest altitude achieved by a North Korean missile. According to the United states Pacific Command, the missile flew for 37 minutes.    North Korea declared that the  long-range missile could ""reach anywhere in the world"" while United States experts concluded that the  land-based missile was likely a two-stage intercontinental ballistic missile (ICMB).     North Korea was effectively delivering a message to the United states that its missiles could hit Hawaii and Alaska, and quite possibly the American mainland.  The only salve to global anxieties was that most experts believed that North Korea was yet to  develop the technology to mount miniaturized nuclear warheads on long-range missiles, although some analysts believe that North Korea may have already achieved this.   At the negotiating table, the fact of the matter was that now the United States' impetus would be to limit rather than eliminate the North Korean missile threat to the United States mainland.    With the global security threat emanating from Pyongyang, there was multilateral work being done at the  United Nations Security Council to advance a resolution that would impose new sanctions on North Korea.  To this end, the United States submitted a draft document to China for review. However, Russia has advocated a less confrontational approach and said that  further sanctions would not resolve the matter.     Meanwhile, United States Secretary of State Rex Tillerson admitted that there were few  good options available on North Korea if the peaceful pressure failed.  He said, ""I call it the peaceful pressure campaign ... This is a campaign to lead us to a peaceful resolution because if this fails, we don't have very many good options left. It's one that requires calculated increases in pressure, allow the regime to respond to that pressure, and it takes a little time to let these things happen.""   By mid-July 2017, the United States military was acknowledging that the latest missile test by North Korea indicated that the Pyongyang had the range capability to hit the United States.  The salve for the United States was the fact that North Korea's lack of guidance technology meant that it was not guaranteed to accurately hit its target.    In a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Air Force General Paul Selva, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said: ""On range, they clearly have the capability.""  Selva noted that the success of a North Korean strike was a matter of debate.  Selva made clear that he was ""not saying"" that North Korea's July 2017 intercontinental ballistic (ICBM) missile test showed that the North Koreans ""have the capacity to strike the U.S. with any degree of accuracy or reasonable confidence of success.""     That being said, given the clear and present danger posed by North Korea to the United States homeland, Selva recommended that a preemptive launch operation be considered  to eliminate Pyongyang's launch capability. He said, ""I think we have to entertain that potential option.""  While that call would have to be made by the president, it would also require authorization by Congress.  As such, Selva was not advancing this idea blithely.  Instead, he called for careful deliberation on the matter with a sense of caution about the deleterious results of such action.  To this end, Selva warned, ""We need to think seriously about what the consequences of that action would be.""   It should be noted that there was little evidence that North Korea possessed the technological capability of launching a miniaturized nuclear warhead attached to a missile. Likewise, there remained a limited test history demonstrating that North Korean missiles were capable of re-entry.   As July 2017 came to a close, North Korea launched another intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM)test -- the second such launch within weeks.  According to the United States Pentagon, the missile was launched from the Mupyong-ni  compound in northern North Korea.  North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un reportedly supervised the launch and said it was a warning to the United States that his country had the ability to strike the American mainland.  To that end, evidence certainly indicated that the ICBM was capable of striking the mainland United States coastline cities of California.    A report by North Korean state media declared the following: ""The test-fire reconfirmed the reliability of the ICBM system, demonstrated the capability of making a surprise launch of the ICBM in any region and place any time, and clearly proved that the whole U.S. mainland is in the firing range of the DPRK missiles.""   In an interview with the media, Pentagon spokesperson Navy Captain Jeff Davis said, ""We detected and tracked a single North Korea missile launch. We assess that this was an ICBM."" Davis also reaffirmed the United States' commitment to defending allied countries in the region, such as South Korea and Japan.  To this end, General Joseph Dunford, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Admiral Harry Harris, the head of U.S. Pacific Command, conveyed to General Lee Sun Jin. the Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman of South Korea, the United States'  ""ironclad commitment"" to its alliance with Seoul.   Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe responded to North Korea's second ICMB launch by declaring, ""As a result of their launches of ICBM-level missiles, this clearly shows the threat to our nation's safety is severe and real.""  Prime Minister Abe also noted the missile may have landed in his country's exclusive economic zone and that a response would be in the offing.      For its part, South Korean President Moon Jae-in called for the United Nations Security Council to impose stronger sanctions against Pyongyang.  South Korea also staged a joint missile exercise with the United States.    China expressed opposition to North Korea's ""launch activities that run counter to Security Council resolutions and the common wishes of the international community.""  As expected, however, China was reticent to take any strong punitive action against Pyongyang, with its foreign ministry stating: ""At the same time, China hopes all parties act with caution, to prevent tensions from continuing to escalate, to jointly protect regional peace and stability.""   This activity by North Korea was only adding to its test history and advancing the chances that it could be a direct threat to other countries in the region, and even the United States.  As noted by  Susan Thornton, the acting assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, during testimony before Congress,  North Korea had to be understood as the United States' ""most urgent and dangerous threat.""  As such, Thornton said, ""We are working to isolate and increase pressure on North Korea with the goal of convincing the regime to return to serious talks aimed at denuclearization. This has been and remains this administration's top diplomatic priority.""   In August 2017,  the United Nations imposed harsh new sanctions on North Korea  for its  latest missile aggression in violation of international law.  The economic sanctions targeted North Korean exports  included  coal, iron, lead and seafood, in addition to revenue/currency streams, such as the repatriation of earnings from North Korean workers in other countries as well as foreign joint ventures.    The effects of these stringent sanctions promised to be painful with the United States ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, warning that they would cost North Korea a full third of its exports -- the equivalent of more than one billion dollars.     But as August 2017 came to a close, it was difficult to ascertain what type of effect the sanctions would have given a report suggesting that North Korea earned millions of dollars in exports.  The information came via a confidential United Nations report, and was reported on by Reuters.  It indicated that North Korea managed to evade sanctions by ""deliberately using indirect channels"" to export banned commodities.  In so doing, during the period of late 2016 through the first part of 2017, North Korea had earned  $270 million.     Meanwhile, North Korea was also subject to public pressure from its closest ally, China, with the Chinese Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, publicly reprimanding North Korea for its belligerence and warning that it would have to accept the new sanctions regime.  To that end, Wang said, ""Do not violate the U.N.'s decision or provoke international society's goodwill by conducting missile launching or nuclear tests.""  There was no immediate public response from North Korea.  There was also no suggestion that tough talk from China -- particularly minus the will to enforce  it -- would have any impact on North Korean behavior.    Despite United States Secretary of State Rex Tillerson making clear that his country had no intention of overthrowing the regime of Kim Jong Un, tensions between the United states and North Korea intensified.  In fact, Tillerson and his North Korean counterpart, Ri Yong Ho, appeared to make a particular effort to avoid accidental meetings at the gathering of  Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in the Philippines.    Trump threatens North Korea ""with fire and fury the likes of which the world has never seen before"" as North Korea threatens Guam --   President Donald Trump said that North Korea would be met ""with fire and fury the likes of which the world has never seen before""  if that country threatened the United States.  The warning came on Aug. 8, 2017 during remarks by the United States president to the press from the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey.     Trump declared: ""North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States. They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen... he has been very threatening beyond a normal state. They will be met with fire, fury and frankly power the likes of which this world has never seen before.""    In the background of Trump's bellicose warning was the assessment by United States intelligence analysts that North Korea had produced a miniaturized nuclear warhead.     Going back to 2014, then-commander of United States Forces Korea, General Curtis Scaparrotti, expressed the view that North Korea  had the capability to miniaturize a warhead.  At the time, he was on the record saying, ""I believe they have the capability to have miniaturized a device at this point, and they have the technology to potentially actually deliver what they say they have.""     A year later, in 2015, North Korea was making the bold claim that it was able to miniaturize nuclear weapons.     In 2017, confidential analysis by the Defense Intelligence Agency, as reported in the  Washington Post, indicated that  North Korea had successfully produced a miniaturized nuclear warhead that could be attached to a ballistic missile.     The production of a miniaturized nuclear warhead  capable of being attached to a ballistic missile would mark a significant technological breakthrough for North Korea.   It would quite literally set North Korea on the final path to being a nuclear power, thus making that country an even more pressing threat to global security, and certainly a clear and present danger to the United States homeland.     To that particular end, United States authorities agreed that they had to be prepared to deal with the threat emanating from North Korea. While there was some confidence that the capability of North Korea's miniaturized nuclear warhead remained relatively untested, there was  collective agreement from the intelligence community that North Korea was making technological developments in the nuclear realm.  Moreover,  given the two test launched of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) in July 2017 alone, it was apparent that North Korea was building on its test launch experience. These breakthrough developments would ultimately lead North Korea progressively down the path of eventually being able to successfully launch  a nuclear capable missile and strike a key target.  Such a move would yield catastrophic consequences for the overall state of global security.    Perhaps with such an end in mind, the negative response to Trump's belligerent rhetoric was bipartisan in nature.  Republican Senator John McCain said in an interview with a Phoenix radio station,  ""The great leaders I've seen don't threaten unless they're ready to act, and I'm not sure President Trump is ready to act."" Democratic Senator  Benjamin Cardin cast Trump's remarks as ""not helpful"" and said, ""We should not be engaging in the same kind of blustery and provocative statements as North Korea about nuclear war.""   It should be noted that while Trump was deploying heated words toward North Korea, his top diplomat, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, had been doing the opposite. Following two ICMB launches by North Korea, as well as the imposition of harsh new United Nations sanctions against Pyongyang, Tillerson made clear that his country was not seeking regime change in North Korea.  But Kim Jong-un appeared unmoved and following Trump's threats of ""fire and fury,"" his regime was considering a strike on the United States' Pacific island territory of Guam.  To this end, North Korea's official news agency KCNA characterized Trump's threat as a ""load of nonsense,"" but nonetheless made an explosive counter-threat to the United States targeting the territory of Guam.   In a statement disseminated by the state-run KCNA news agency, North Korea made clear that it was ""carefully examining"" plans for a missile strike on  Guam.  A spokesperson for the Korean People's Army (KPA) declared: ""The KPA Strategic Force is now carefully examining the operational plan for making an enveloping fire at the areas around Guam with medium-to-long-range strategic ballistic rocket Hwasong-12 in order to contain the U.S. major military bases on Guam including the Anderson Air Force Base.""    North Korea then disclosed that by mid-August it would have in place a plan to  launch four intermediate range missiles at Guam, which would then simply require the launch directive from  Kim Jong Un to attack. The plan was described by North Korean authorities as follows: ""The Hwasong-12 rockets to be launched by the KPA (Korean People's Army) will cross the sky above Shimane, Hiroshima and Koichi Prefectures of Japan. They will fly 3,356.7 km (2,085.8 miles) for 1,065 seconds and hit the waters 30 to 40 km away from Guam.""   On Guam, which was home to about 120,000 people including 6,000 United States military personnel, as well as several military bases and installations, local authorities posted emergency guidelines.  Some of the warnings of an impending strike by North Korea read as follows: ""Do not look at the flash or fireball – It can blind you... Take cover behind anything that might offer protection.""   There were indications from China and Russia that both powers believed that dangerous rhetoric be curtailed and that multilateral negotiations should resume, with an eye on resolving the North Korean nuclear issue.  However, it seemed that North Korea was in no mood to negotiate with the United States, given Trump's aggressive posture. According to Pyongyang,  ""Sound dialogue is not possible with such a guy bereft of reason and only absolute force can work on him.""   United States authorities wasted no time in delivering its own response to North Korea.  United States Defense Secretary James Mattis warned that North Korea should not take  any actions that would lead to the ""end of its regime and the destruction of its people.""   Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov  lamented the deteriorating discourse between the United States and North Korea, saying, ""Unfortunately, the rhetoric in Washington and Pyongyang is now starting to go over the top.  We still hope and believe that common sense will prevail."" German Chancellor Angela Merkel delivered a similar message, reminding all parties that there was no military solution to the dispute, and that ""an escalation of the rhetoric is the wrong answer.""    China's Foreign Ministry, meanwhile, suggested that all parties try to ease tensions rather than taking turns to escalate them.   But for the time being, President Trump seemed undeterred by criticism of his ""fire and fury"" reference that has only ratcheted up tension.  Instead, he appeared to double down by escalating the rhetoric further.  Via Twitter, Trump declared: ""Military solutions are now fully in place, locked and loaded, should North Korea act unwisely."" He added,  ""Hopefully Kim Jong Un will find another path!""     There were some suggestions that North Korea was reversing itself on its threat to launch missiles towards Guam.  However, that reticence was reversed when the United States and South Korea carried out military drills -- a move viewed as inflammatory by observers, including Russia and China who urged against such provocative action.  The United States and South Korea  both respectively maintained that the military exercises were ""defensive in nature"" while North Korea viewed them as practice ahead of an impending war or invasion.     Not surprisingly, the ante was upped once again with North Korea's official state newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, saying in an editorial that the drills would exacerbate tensions on the Korean peninsula, with the possibility of an ""uncontrollable phase of a nuclear war"" in the offing.     In the third week of August 2017, when the drills commenced,  North Korea condemned the move as a ""reckless"" step toward nuclear conflict.  As stated by the North Korean KCNA state news agency,  ""This is aimed to ignite a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula at any cost. The situation on the Korean peninsula has plunged into a critical phase due to the reckless north-targeted war racket of the war maniacs.""   North Korean nuclear threat tests long-standing alliances --   North Korean nuclear aggression has tested long-standing alliances in east Asia. Tensions intensified in September 2017 following North Korea's sixth nuclear test, believed to be that of a hydrogen bomb.   South Korea's new leader,  Moon Jae-in, who had been elected partially on the basis of a ""pro-dialogue"" platform, was again advocating this approach, with an eye on denuclearization.  However, it was apparent from Kim Jong-un's regularized actions of nuclear aggression that there was no easy answer to the question of how to handle the North Korean regime.    Earlier in 2017, with North Korea posing a grave nuclear security threat, the United States in moved an anti-missile system to South Korea.   That action took place in April 2017.    Experts have generally maintained the view that despite North Korea's ongoing -- and alarming -- progress in developing a warhead capable of being attached to a missile, there has still been insufficient  technology developed and testing done by North Korea to successfully deliver a nuclear device.  Nevertheless, North Korea's belligerent missile tests constituted a reminder of its status as a pariah nation posing a global security threat.    As stated by then-Defense Secretary Ash Carter of the former Obama administration in the United States in 2016, while North Korea should be viewed as a ""serious threat,"" the United States had the capability to shoot down any missile posing a threat to the homeland.  Indeed, the United States' Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system (THAAD) has been deployed by the Obama administration to be at the ready to defend the United States homeland and its allies.     In a warning to the incoming Trump administration in the United States, North Korea released a statement that read:  ""Anyone who wants to deal with (North Korea) would be well advised to secure a new way of thinking after having a clear understanding of it.""   In this way, North Korea appeared to be signaling to the incoming Trump administration in the United States that continuing down the road of economic sanctions would prevent a return to the negotiating table.    Well into 2017, the deployment of the United States' high resolution radar anti-missile  Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system in South Korea to protect that country from the North was still on the agenda. That being said, the  South Korean Defense Ministry said the system's deployment could be delayed.  There were some suggestions of a bureaucratic delay; however, it was also becoming a political consideration.     At issue was China's objections to the deployment of the United States  missile defense  system in its ""backyard,"" with anxieties rising about retaliatory economic consequences.  Also at issue was the possible repercussions from North Korea.     As such, it  was impacting the emerging presidential contest in South Korea.  The THAAD system was approved by the now-impeached President Park Geu-hye and had conservative support, including that of Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn.  THAAD also had the support of former United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who was also expected to contest the presidential contest. However, the main opposition  candidate,  Moon Jae-in of Democratic Party of Korea, opposed the move, and particularly  President Park's decision to unilaterally agree to the deployment of the THAAD system.  Moon -- considered a frontrunner for the presidency -- urged that the National Assembly debate the issue before THAAD could actually be deployed.    Nevertheless, by April 2017, the United States military had transported the THAAD system to a deployment site 150 miles to the south of the South Korean capital of Seoul. The system was set to become operational in short order and as the month of April 2017 came to a close,  United states authorities announced that the process was going smoothly.   The deployment of the THAAD system spurred protests at home from locals, and condemnations from  China.  In terms of protests, the mass action attracted hundreds of villagers, with at least 10 people being injured in clashes with police.   Nevertheless, the demonstrations were expected to continue for some time, and were backed by the political opposition.  Indeed, the presence of THAAD, as well as relations with both the United States and North Korea, were becoming key issues in an impending presidential election that was expected to be won by the opposition.  To be clear, the opposition has championed dialogue with North Korea and expressed strenuous opposition for THAAD, because of its likelihood to antagonize both North Korea and China.   China's objections resided in its claim that THAAD's advanced radar capability would violate its security.  The Chinese foreign ministry issued a statement via spokesperson Geng Shuang as follows: ""China strongly urges the United States and South Korea to stop actions that worsen regional tensions and harm China's strategic security interests and cancel the deployment of the THAAD system and withdraw the equipment."" Geng added, ""China will resolutely take necessary steps to defend its interests.""  To that end, the Chinese Defense Ministry said that it would conduct live fire drills and test new weapons in response to the presence of THAAD in the region.   Soon thereafter the new South Korean president suspended the deployment of THAAD in that country pending an environmental review.    Note that as of July 2017, the United States announced that the THAAD system had successfully intercepted its target during a test run conducted in Alaska.    In other developments, two United States B-1B Lancer supersonic strategic bombers conducted live-fire drills in South Korea in a show of force following North Korea's July 2017 test-launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).    By the start of September 2017, as discussed in more detail below, North Korea had detonated a thermonuclear device believed to be a hydrogen bomb, and one more powerful in yield to a nuclear test a year prior.   South Korea reacted by placing  all military troops on high alert and convening a National Security Council. Japan confirmed that a nuclear test had taken place and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe condemned North Korea's latest nuclear moves as ""absolutely unacceptable.""   North Korea itself soon declared that not only had it carried out a nuclear test, but that it had successfully developed a hydrogen bomb that could be loaded onto an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), and was capable of striking the mainland United States.   United States President Donald Trump reacted be warning that he would not foreclose a retaliatory strike.  When he was asked if he was planning to attack North Korea, Trump responded to reporters saying, ""We'll see.""     President Trump then criticized South Korea for a policy of appeasement with the North, saying Twitter,  ""South Korea is finding, as I have told them, that their talk of appeasement with North Korea will not work, they only understand one thing!""   In addition to his threat to pull the United States out of a trade deal with South Korea, these moves appeared to strain rather than strengthen the long-standing United States-South Korea alliance.     While South Korean President Moon Jae-in  refused to take the bait and instead said that his country was focused on achieving the peaceful denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, the fact was that dissonance was brewing among players with vested interests in east Asia.    With those stakes in mind,  Defense Secretary James Mattis issued reassurances to South Korea, noting that ""the commitments among the allies are ironclad.""  Mattis also said, ""Any threat to the United States or its territories, including Guam, or our allies will be met with a massive military response —- a response both effective and overwhelming."" In measured yet resolute terms, Mattis added, ""We are not looking for the total annihilation of a country, namely North Korea, but as I said, we have many options to do so.""   But as quickly as Mattis was trying to heal any perceived breach with South Korea, Trump was needling China.  Indeed, the United States president suggested that his country might cut off trade with anyone doing business with North Korea.  The economic devastation produced by such a proposition aside, the threat was unlikely to help resolve the  east Asian nuclear crisis, and it was certainly unlikely to pressure China in regard to North Korea. So too, Trump's tactic of shaming China was unlikely to produce desired results.    Via twitter, Trump said that North Korea had become ""a great threat and embarrassment to China, which is trying to help but with little success."" That shaming strategy appeared to have raised the ire of China  with the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Geng Shuang, chastising Trump for taking a position unfair to Beijing. At a news briefing, geng said, ""What is definitely unacceptable to us is that on the one hand we work so hard to peacefully resolve this issue and on the other hand our interests are subject to sanctions and jeopardized. This is unfair.""   At a time when the international community should be working together to contain and stymie the threat to global security posed by North Korea, long standing alliances were instead in a state of tension.    In fact, it is only through reassurances to allies that the United States can reduce incentives for South Korea and Japan to become nuclearized themselves.  Such an end would result in an east Asian arms race that could destabilize the region.   To this point, United States' assurances to   the likes of South Korea and Japan are key, and would require the president of the United States to issue a clear ""declaratory policy"" detailing American retaliatory commitments, should an ally be attacked.    Rhetorical flourishes of ""fire and fury"" and shaming allies by casting them as appeasers would not fall into this category.  Thus, the immediate task for the United States as it confronts the North Korean nuclear threat to the homeland should begin with alliance management and assuring the world of alliance solidarity.   North Korea carries out sixth nuclear test    At the start of September 2017, North Korea carried out its sixth nuclear test in flagrant defiance of international law.  According to Pyongyang, it tested  a hydrogen bomb capable of fitting on an intercontinental ballistic missile and reaching the mainland United States.  Indeed, North Korea claimed ""perfect success"" in this hydrogen bomb test endeavor -- the latest in a string of provocative and dangerous nuclear acts starting less than a dozen years earlier.     The detonated bomb caused an artificial earthquake, measuring approximately 6 in magnitude, according to the South Korean military, which cited seismic activity detected at a North Korean nuclear test site.  The increased yield in this September 2017 test as compared with a nuclear test a year ago would suggest that this was North Korea's most powerful nuclear experiment to date.  To be sure, a thermonuclear device such as a hydrogen bomb would certainly surpass the destructive power of the atomic bombs that destroyed the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II.    Across the border in South Korea, all military troops were placed on high alert while a National Security Council meeting was convened.  In Japan, the government of that country confirmed that a nuclear test had taken place and that seismic waves had been detected.   Given Japan's intimate memory of decimation via nuclear attack, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe characterized North Korea's latest nuclear moves as ""absolutely unacceptable.""   Hours after the reports of the nuclear test surfaced internationally, North Korea officially announced not only that it had carried out a nuclear test, but that it had successfully developed a hydrogen bomb that could be loaded onto an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).  Moreover, North Korea was telegraphing that its hydrogen bomb would be attached to a missile capable of striking the mainland United States.   United States President Donald Trump reacted to this act of North Korean provocation by making clear that he would not foreclose a retaliatory strike.  When he was asked if he was planning to attack North Korea, Trump responded to reporters saying, ""We'll see.""     Then, instead of consolidating long standing alliances in east Asia, Trump instead blasted South Korea for a policy of appeasement with the North.  Via the social media outlet, Twitter, Trump declared: ""South Korea is finding, as I have told them, that their talk of appeasement with North Korea will not work, they only understand one thing!""      It should be noted that Trump has also floated the idea of backing out from a free trade deal with South Korea.  But at a time when close cooperative ties with allies in the region would be needed, such a move could prove both alienating and detrimental.   As a consequence,  Defense Secretary James Mattis was forced to issue reassurances to Seoul and the world that ""the commitments among the allies are ironclad.""  Standing next to General Joseph Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mattis said, ""Any threat to the United States or its territories, including Guam, or our allies will be met with a massive military response —- a response both effective and overwhelming.""  Striking a measured but resolute tone, Mattis added, ""We are not looking for the total annihilation of a country, namely North Korea, but as I said, we have many options to do so.""   For his part, South Korean President Moon Jae-in sidestepped the barb and instead said that his country was focused on achieving the peaceful denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, in coordination with ""our allies.""     That goal of peaceful denuclearization was also reiterated by United Nations Security Council veto-wielding members, China and Russia.  Indeed, both Chinese President Xi Jinping and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin recapitulated their shared objective of the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. However, it was unclear if such an objective was even possible, given North Korea's clear and demonstrable desire to establish itself as a nuclear power.   As noted by Stanford professor, director of the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies (FSI), and former United States Ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul, ""Declaring denuclearization as the goal without an effective strategy for achieving this outcome is not a policy, just a hope. We need a short-term strategy for freezing the North Korean nuclear program now to have any chance of achieving denuclearization in the future.""  That short-term strategy, according to McFaul,  would rely on coercive diplomacy by a unified international community. But such a strategy would require cooperation with friends, allies, and powerful actors, such as China and Russia, which also sit on the United Nations Security Council.     Thus, Trump's suggestion that the United States cut off trade with any country doing business with North Korea was being interpreted by many as counter-productive. First, it  would be economically devastating domestically by driving up prices on consumer goods, and second, t would also devastate economies across the world. Third, and more crucially to the point of dealing with the east Asian nuclear crisis, it was unlikely to sway China to shift its tactics in regard to North Korea.   Trade threats aside, Trump also appeared to use a shaming tactic to pressure China to constrain North Korea.  He said via Twitter that North Korea had become ""a great threat and embarrassment to China, which is trying to help but with little success.""  Again, this particular form of pressure was not expected to be persuasive with the Chinese.    In fact, it immediately appeared to have set China into an intransigent stance with the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Geng Shuang, chastising Trump for taking a position unfair to Beijing. At a news briefing, geng said, ""What is definitely unacceptable to us is that on the one hand we work so hard to peacefully resolve this issue and on the other hand our interests are subject to sanctions and jeopardized. This is unfair.""   Meanwhile, there was some closing of the ranks between the United States and South Korea following a call between the two leaders of these countries.  Trump agreed ""in principle"" to dismiss the 1100 pound (500 kilogram)   warhead weight limit on South Korea's missiles.  As well, Trump offered ""conceptual approval"" for South Korea to buy billions of dollars worth  of weapons from the United States.     UN Security Council imposes sanctions on North Korea   The next step in coordinated international action against North Korean nuclear aggression would be at the United Nations Security Council. There was general agreement from allied countries that strong and aggressive sanctions should be slapped on North Korea for its sixth nuclear test.  But there were also fresh avenues under consideration, such as the severing of North Korea's foreign currency income.    In the second week of September 2017,  something less than a harsh sanctions package emerged from the United Nations Security Council. It was unclear if threats from North Korea may have influenced the decision to ""water down"" the sanctions measures. As reported by Reuters News, the original proposal to include an oil embargo,  halt exports of textiles, and subject North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un,  to financial and travel ban, was diluted somewhat.  Of note was the decision to exclude the financial and travel ban on Kim Jong-un and weaken the oil and gas sanctions.    While this move was disappointing to hardliners, the fact of the matter was that there was no guarantee that further sanctions would function punitively to end the risk to global security posed by a nuclearized North Korea. This was a point emphasized by United States President Donald Trump after the resolution from the United Nations Security Council entered the public sphere. But the truth was that neither international sanctions nor harsh bellicose rhetoric from the leader of the free world have shown any sign of compelling North Korea to denuclearize.  Perhaps fueled by that knowledge, Trump, as before, was telegraphing that much more drastic measures were likely needed to bring North Korea to heel,   Worth noting was the fact that other options on the table were equally unpalatable and unlikely to be successful. Regime change or leader decapitation would present risky and unrealistic pathways, likely to provoke North Korea rather than end its aggression.     Meanwhile, the peace camp's notion that a resumption of multilateral talks could result in a breakthrough with North Korea seemed rather delusional.  South Korea's new leader,  Moon Jae-in, who had been elected partially on the basis of a ""pro-dialogue"" platform, was again advocating this approach irrespective of the reality that communication or ""talks"" were a means but not the end to the security crisis facing the world.    At the heart of the matter was the conviction held by North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, that his possession of nuclear weapons serves as a check on  threats to his regime.  In fact, on the heels of North Korea's sixth nuclear test came the news that Kim Jong-un was planning an ICBM launch.  To this end, on Sept. 15, 2017, North Korea launched an ICBM that traveled close to 2,300 miles -- enough distance to strike Guam, although it was not aimed at the United States territory; the missile traversed the skies over Japan's island of Hokkaido, before falling into the Pacific Ocean.   In reaction, the United Nations Security Council characterized North Korea's missile launch  in familiar language as ""highly provocative"" and ""outrageous."" United States President Donald Trump went further, as he warned North Korea that  a show of force could be in the offing.  Trump said: ""Our options are not only effective but overwhelming."" The president's national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, issued as similar warning, as he said, ""There is a military option.""  At the same time, the United States's top diplomat, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, demanded that China and Russia do more to deter North Korea.  He said, ""China supplies North Korea with most of its oil. Russia is the largest employer of North Korean forced labor. China and Russia must indicate their intolerance for these reckless missile launches by taking direct actions of their own.""   Not surprisingly, Russia and China were opposed to the United States Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's call for more ""direct actions"" against North Korea, and instead, expressed the view that the Trump administration try to defuse rather than amp up the threat of nuclear war.     After a United Nations Security Council meeting, Russian Ambassador to the United Nations Vasily Nebenzya made clear that his country would enforce the sanctions imposed on North Korea, but go no further.  Nebenzya noted that the United Nations resolution also contained a call for negotiations and urged the United States to honor that aspect of the measure.  He said, ""We called on our U.S. partners and others to implement political and diplomatic solutions that are provided for in the resolution.""  Taking a strong stand in the pro-diplomacy camp, the Russian ambassador added, ""Without implementing this, we also will consider it as a noncompliance with the resolution.""     China's ambassador to the United States struck a similar tone in the aftermath of U.S. Secretary of State Tillerson's provocative suggestion that there be more ""direct actions"" by Beijing and Moscow against North Korea.  Speaking from the Chinese embassy in Washington D.C., Ambassador Cui Tiankai said, ""Honestly, I think the United States should be doing...much more than now, so that there's real effective international cooperation on this issue."" He added, ""They should refrain from issuing more threats. They should do more to find effective ways to resume dialogue and negotiation.""   But such advice went unheeded. During his address before the United Nations General Assembly, President Trump mocked his North Korean counterpart, saying of Kim Jong-un, ""Rocket man is on a suicide mission."" Trump then issued his most belligerent and incendiary threat to North Korea to date as he declared:  ""If [the United States] is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.""     The declaration was met with shock from among the international community gathered at the United Nations General Assembly. News media on the ground reported audible gasps and murmurs from other heads of state, and even some audience members covering their faces with the hands in apparent expressions of discomfort.  The foreign minister of Sweden's conservative government,  Margot Wallstrom, criticized Trump in an interview with BBC News, saying: ""It was the wrong speech, at the wrong time, to the wrong audience."" German Chancellor Angela Merkel, reacted by asserting, ""There can only be a diplomatic solution"" to North Korea. Even members of the media weighed in, with ABC News' chief foreign correspondent, Terry Moran, saying that Trump's threat to destroy North Korea  ""borders on the threat of committing a war crime.""  Indeed, the notion of wiping a country of 25 million peopled off the map would certainly qualify as such.    For his part, the head of the United Nations, Secretary General António Guterres disparaged the use of reckless rhetoric, saying, ""The use of nuclear weapons should be unthinkable. Even the threat of their use can never be condoned. But today global anxieties about nuclear weapons are at the highest level since the end of the Cold War."" He added, ""When tensions rise, so does the chance of miscalculation. Fiery talk can lead to fatal misunderstandings.""   Meanwhile, North Korea conveyed to the international community that the actions taken by the United Nations Security Council -- even in its ""watered down"" form -- would only cause that country to accelerate it nuclear development.  A statement by the North Korean foreign ministry, which was disseminated via the country's official news agency KCNA, read as follows: ""The increased moves of the US and its vassal forces to impose sanctions and pressure on the DPRK [Democratic People's Republic of Korea] will only increase our pace towards the ultimate completion of the state nuclear force.""   For his part, the North Korean leader was making it clear that his country's nuclear proliferation program was in the best interests of self-preservation.  Kim Jong-un was quoted in unambiguous terms as saying, ""Our final goal is to establish the equilibrium of real force with the United States and make the U.S. rulers dare not talk about military options.""    Clearly, the North Korean regime was functioning in an unchecked manner, in flagrant violation of international law, and with all major global powers seemingly incapable of strategizing cooperatively on an effective solution.   War rhetoric intensifies --   On Sept. 23, 2017, in retaliation for President Trump's reference to Kim Jong-un as ""Rocket Man on a suicide mission,"" North Korea issued a warning to the United States.  North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said in an address to the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable that his country would target the United States mainland with its missiles.    President Trump again opted to react with his own brand of vituperative rhetoric, rather than dialing down the tensions.  Using his favorite social media outlet, Twitter, the United States president again threatened to destroy North Korea.  He tweeted: ""Just heard Foreign Minister of North Korea speak at U.N. If he echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man, they won't be around much longer!""    In October 2017, it was apparent that tensions between the United States and North Korea were burning at new -- and potentially unprecedented -- levels.  Of concern was the fact that North Korea appeared to be reacting with continued outrage to Trump's belligerent rhetoric before the United Nations General Assembly.  In an interview with the Russian TASS news agency, North Korean Foreign Minister  Ri Yong Ho  said that Trump had ""lit the wick of war"" in the aforementioned  United Nations General Assembly speech.     Ri Yong Ho was quoted as saying:  ""With his bellicose and insane statement at the United Nations, Trump, you can say, has lit the wick of a war against us.""  The North Korean foreign minister added the following ominous warning: ""We need to settle the final score, only with a hail of fire, not words.""   The notion of scores between the United States and North Korea being settled via  war and not through diplomacy alarmed the international  community.  Nevertheless, the United States leader had already telegraphed to his own secretary of state -- and the world at large -- that he was not interested in charting the course of diplomacy.    At the start of October 2017, President Donald Trump directly undercut United States Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's diplomatic mission. Tillerson had indicated he would attempt dialogue with North Korea, with an eye on diffusing escalating tensions and moving away from the nuclear war rhetoric and more towards solutions.  But Trump appeared to torpedo Tillerson's diplomatic effort before it was even started in earnest.   Trump said via Twitter: ""I told Rex Tillerson, our wonderful Secretary of State, that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man."" In this way, Trump was again using the same derogatory nickname he previously used in regard to the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un.  Making natters worse, Trump appeared to raise the specter of devastating war as he added, ""Save your energy Rex. We'll do what has to be done!""   On the other side of the equation, North Korea was digging in its own heels. During the aforementioned interview with Russia's TASS news agency, the North Korean foreign minister declared: ""Our principal position is that we will never agree to any talks in which our nuclear weapons will be the subject of negotiations.""     Indeed, in the third week of October 2017, North Korea rejected the very idea of diplomacy with the United States.  Instead,  North Korea reiterated its commitment to developing a long-range intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching ""all the way to the East coast of the mainland United States."" In an interview with CNN, Pyongyang made clear that it had no interest in pursuing the diplomatic path with the United States until that objective was achieved.  North Korea was also reiterating its previously made threat to  test a long range ICBM capable of reaching the United States territory of Guam. North Korea was going down this road, arguing that ""reckless moves"" by the United States would force it to take retaliatory action.    Given that North Korea's central impetus was regime survival, its following pronouncement was ostensibly pragmatic. A North Korean official declared: ""Before we can engage in diplomacy with the Trump administration, we want to send a clear message that the DPRK has a reliable defensive and offensive capability to counter any aggression from the United States.""    Amidst the rhetoric were anxieties about progress being made by the North Koreans at the technical level. United States officials had already telegraphed that they believed North Korea had  produced a miniaturized nuclear warhead. As of October 2017, concerns about being struck by a North Korean missile were mitigated by the fact that a North Korean missile would have to successfully re-enter the earth's atmosphere without disintegrating in order to actually hit a target.  Until recently, there were suggestions that North Korea had not achieved this end; however, the uptick in rhetoric from the United States indicated that it believed North Korea might very well be close to achieving this breakthrough moment.     It was believed that a possible visit by United States President Donald Trump to the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) in November 2017 might provoke North Korea in some fashion.  But United States Secretary of State Rex Tillerson gave assurances that his diplomatic efforts would continue ""until the first bomb drops.""  This assertion by Tillerson in an interview with CNN, nevertheless, tacitly indicated that bombs might very well drop.  And the United States president had himself, already, suggested that only a military solution was in the offing.    Again, with regime survival at the forefront of the mind of North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, it was highly unlikely that North Korea would go down the ""first strike"" road.  However, it was unclear what the pragmatic calculus was from the United States end.  At a meeting with the military, United States President raised the specter of military conflict with North Korea saying, ""We cannot allow this dictatorship to threaten our nation or our allies with unimaginable loss of life. We will do what we must do to prevent that from happening and it will be done if necessary, believe me.""  Then, in an interview with American media Trump on Oct. 22, 2017, Trump appeared to provoke attack by the North Koreans, declaring: ""You would be shocked to see how totally prepared we are if we need to be.""   As October 2017 was coming to a close, North Korea was doing its part to intensify the rhetorical brinkmanship stakes when it indicated that the world should  take ""literally"" the country's threat to test a nuclear weapon above ground. Ri Yong Pil a senior North Korean official, indicated that North Korea was not bluffing when it said that it could test a powerful hydrogen bomb over the Pacific Ocean.     In early November 2017,  while on a trip to Asia, United States President Donald Trump  warned Pyongyang that he was prepared to use the use his country's military strength against North Korea. The hardline threat was matched with a negotiating ""carrot"" of sorts as he called on North Korea to ""make a deal"" that would end the nuclear crisis.     Speaking from the South Korean capital of Seoul, Trump said that while ""we hope to God"" not to use the full gamut of United States military power, he was nonetheless prepared to take drastic measures against the ""North Korean dictator.""  He said, ""We cannot allow North Korea to threaten all that we have built.""  Trump sought to demonstrate his resolve against North Korea as he noted that Pyongyang had to  understand the ""unparalleled strength"" that the United States had at its disposal. But Trump also took a more measured tone as he urged North Korea to ""do the right thing.""  At a joint conference with the South Korean leader, Trump said, ""It really makes sense for North Korea to come to the table and make a deal.""   For his part, North Korean leader Kon Jong-un appeared unimpressed, and instead reacted by casting Trump as a ""mentally deranged U.S. dotard.""  As ever, Trump took to Twitter to react to his North Korean counterpart.  From that social media platform, Trump tweeted: ""Why would Kim Jong-un insult me by calling me 'old,' when I would NEVER call him 'short and fat?' Oh well, I try so hard to be his friend - and maybe someday that will happen!""    Trump's Asian trip ultimately ended with North Korea maintaining a hostile stance against the United States and its allies.  Pyongyang assessed that Trump's first trip to Asia revealed him to be  a ""destroyer."" Pyongyang interpreted Trump's message as one that was inviting war in  the Korean peninsula.  A statement by the North Korean Foreign Ministry, which was broadcast via state media, read as follows: ""Trump, during his visit, laid bare his true nature as destroyer of world peace and stability and begged for a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula."" North Korean then reinforced its own resolve to remain focused on pursuing a nuclear weapons program.   On Nov. 20, 2017, the hostility between the United States and North Korea was expected to increase as Trump announced that the United States was placing North Korea back on its list of state sponsors of terrorism.  North Korea had been removed from that list in 2008 by the administration of George W. Bush during negotiations on North Korea's nuclear program. Trump also noted that ""very large"" additional sanctions against North Korea were in the offing.   North Korea launches new ballistic missile; Pyongyang poses worldwide threat   On Nov. 28, 2017, North Korea  launched a new ballistic missile -- its latest in a series of launches that have exponentially raised the concerns of the international community. According to the United States Pentagon, this particular test involved an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).    North Korea's first intercontinental ballistic missile test was in July 2017.  At the time, North Korea warned that it could hit ""any part of the world."" United States military officials dismissed the claim at the time, saying that the missile at stake was an intermediate range missile. A series of missile tests followed through to September 2017. That September 2017 test occurred only days after North Korea conducted its sixth nuclear test.  In November 2017, it was clear that North Korea was accelerating and intensifying its missile and nuclear testing, as promised.     Pentagon spokesperson Colonel Rob Manning said in an interview with that media that  the missile was ""launched from Sain Ni, North Korea, and traveled about 1,000 kilometers before splashing down in the Sea of Japan, within Japan's Economic Exclusion Zone.""     Jim Sciutto of CNN – via the social media outlet Twitter – noted that the North Korean ICMB ""flew approximately 3700 miles up -- 1400 miles higher than its previous highest-altitude launch.""  By cresting that height – approximately 4,500 kilometers above the earth's surface – North Korea was making new and impressive strides in its missile and nuclear program.    The Japanese government noted that the missile  travelled for about 50 minutes but did not fly over its territory, as has been the case previously.  Still, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called for an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council  in response to North Korea's clearly provocative action.    Of note was the fact that this ICBM test occurred after United States President Donald Trump had redesignated North Korea as state sponsor of terrorism because of its missile and nuclear program.  It also ensued ahead of joint military exercises scheduled to take place in mid-December 2017.    Adam Mount, a senior fellow at the Federation of American Scientists, noted in an interview with CNN noted that North Korea was undeterred in its missile and nuclear development ambitions. He said,  ""Today's test proves that Pyongyang still feels able to test at will.""  He added that the Trump administration ""has to get serious about deterring an atmospheric nuclear test.""  That remained a prevailing threat, given the fact that North Korean Foreign Ministry Ri Yong Ho indicated in September 2017 that his country could carry out an atmospheric nuclear test over the Pacific Ocean.    It should be noted that in response to this latest missile test, President Trump responded by saying, ""We will take care of it,"" but declined to offer any details.    United States Defense Secretary James Mattis issued a more particularized reaction to North Korea's latest act of belligerence, as he warned that with North Korea enjoying its highest ever missile launch, it posed a worldwide threat.  According to Secretary Mattis, North Korea  now had the ability to hit ""everywhere in the world basically"" with an ICBM.    For the United States homeland, that meant that no state was exempt from this alarming North Korean threat.  But Mattis was trying to draw the entire international community together as being at risk from a nuclearized North Korea.    At the start of December 2017, United States national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, said that the possibility of war with North Korea was ""increasing every day."" Speaking at the Reagan National Defense Forum, he said: ""I think it's increasing every day.""  McMaster cited  the latest North Korean missile launch, which managed unprecedented height and range, to emphasize the looming threat posed by North Korea.  He said, ""The greatest immediate threat to the United States and to the world is the threat posed by the rogue regime in North Korea. Every time he conducts a missile launch, a nuclear test, he gets better.""   Anxieties over this North Korean threat would be only slightly assuaged by the knowledge that the latest ICBM launch demonstrated range and height, but not necessarily delivery and payload capacity. It was unknown if this missile, launched on Nov. 28, 2017, could conceivably carry a payload of around 1,000 pounds (the type of capacity actually needed for it to be effective).  Also a matter of debate is the whether or not the  reentry vehicle, which returns the payload to the surface of the earth's surface, actually withstood the pressure of re-entry.   Some political analysts in the United States, such as speechwriter and commentator Marc Thiessen, have argued that ""Trump should take out the site where North Korea just launched a missile.""  Such a move, however, would be largely ineffective.  First, North Korea is in possession of mobile missile systems, allowing it to test fire from open pads.  Thus, ""taking out"" one particular site would hardly curtail the North Korean missile and nuclear program.  Second, if such a strike were to be taken as limited punitive action, it was highly likely to be misinterpreted by the North Koreans as a first strike attack, thus provoking a North Korean response, with catastrophic consequences.  Among the more realistic results would be a full blow war on the border between the two Koreas, given the presence of United States troops in the South.  Such a war, with nuclear armed players involved, could quite literally mean the prospect of nuclear war.  Meanwhile, the United States would have to consider the fact that its existing  missile defense architecture has not been reliably tested.    In truth, the North Korean question has yielded no good answer from the international community. It was clear that harsh rhetoric, sanctions, and even hyperbolic threats  have had no effect on North Korea,  which has continued to act in flagrant violation of international law.     Still, North Korea was making clear that it was yet functioning as a rational actor. With the  central impetus of the leader of North Korea -- Kim Jong-un -- being regime survival, it was not surprising that his most reliable path to self-preservation was via the North Korean missile development and nuclear proliferation program.  In fact, North Korea had already expressly stated that it had no interest in diplomacy, particularly with the Trump administration in the United States, until it had demonstrated ""its offensive capability to counter any aggression from the United States.""  As stated by Kim Jong-un in unambiguous terms: ""Our final goal is to establish the equilibrium of real force with the United States and make the U.S. rulers dare not talk about military options.""    Note that in December 2017, the United Nations  Security Council imposed new sanctions on North Korea as a result of that country's ICBM test. The new sanctions were imposed unanimously with a 15-0 vote and  limited its access to refined petroleum products and crude oil. If enforced, the cap on oil and petroleum products could well damage North Korea's haulage industry.  The sanctions also calls for the repatriation of North Koreans working abroad within 24 months. Again, if enforced, the  repatriation of foreign workers could cut off sources of necessary foreign currency to North Korea. The sanctions also included prohibitions on North Korean exports of food products,  industrial equipment, and industrial metals.   Alert:  Trump starts new year by saying his nuclear button is bigger and more effective than Kim Jong-un's nuclear button   In his New Year's address, North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, warned the United States against aggressive actions, warning that he was capable of attacking the entirety of the United States.  In his annual address, Kim Jong-un said, ""The entire United States is within range of our nuclear weapons, a nuclear button is always on my desk. This is reality, not a threat.""   On Jan. 2, 2017, United States President Donald Trump reacted to this warning from Kim Jong-un by saying that his nuclear button was bigger and more effective than the North Korean leader's nuclear button. Using his favorite social media outlet, Twitter, Trump said: ""North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un just stated that the Nuclear Button is on his desk at all times. Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!""   Critics warned that Trump's tweet was akin to baiting North Korea into an armed conflict at a time when the two Koreas were considering bilateral talks ahead of the winter Olympics in South Korea.  Despite Trump's tweet rhetoric, some progress was made between the two Koreas on Jan. 3, 2018 when they agreed to reconnect the hotline between the two countries that was shut down in early 2016.     Editor's Note on North Korea's Nuclear Test History:   In October 2006, North Korea said it intended to test a nuclear weapon.  Despite strenuous urging by the international community, including China, that North Korea not follow this course, North Korea carried out a test of a nuclear weapon. The international community responded to North Korea's announcement with widespread condemnation and a punitive United Nations Security Council resolution endorsing financial and security sanctions.   Resolution  1718 called for  the inspections on cargo going to and from North Korea to search for weapons, a ban on the sale or transfer of materials related to North Korea's unconventional weapons program, and a freeze on the transfer of funds connected with North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs. The resolution was passed under Chapter Seven, Article 41, of the United Nations Charter; however, absent from Resolution 1718 was the Chapter Seven provision that would enforce the sanctions via military force. For its part,  the North Korean government in Pyongyang decried Resolution 1718,  and warned that subsequent pressure by the United States would be regarded as  ""a declaration of war.""   April 2009 saw North Korea take provocative action by launching a communications satellite into space via rocket.  That claim was widely viewed as obfuscation of a missile test.  Then a month later in May 2009, less than three years after the earlier underground nuclear test, North Korea conducted a second such test, arguing the merits of its right to a military deterrent. Days later, North Korea announced its withdrawal from the armistice that ended the Korean War.   At the international level, the United Nations Security Council noted that the 2009 nuclear test by North Korea was a violation of Security Council Resolution 1718, which prohibits Pyongyang from carrying out nuclear tests.  In response, the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1874 in June 2009 -- a month after the underground nuclear test.  The resolution was passed under Chapter Seven, Article 41, of the United Nations Charter, and imposed further economic and commercial sanctions on North Korea.  Additionally,  it encouraged United Nations member states to search North Korean cargo in the effort to enforce those sanctions.   It should be noted that the nuclear tests in 2006 and 2009 constituted unassailable violations of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1718  and  1874, which exist in tandem with Article 41 of Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter and compel compliance by all member states. They are binding under international law.   The 2006 and 2009 nuclear tests were also breaches of  the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.  The apparent nuclear test on Feb. 12, 2013 would also stand as a flagrant violation of that treaty.   In March 2013, the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 2094 censuring North Korea for its February  nuclear test and imposing an even stricter sanctions regime on that country.  The United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the unanimous adoption of the resolution delivered a strong message to North Korea that its pursuit of nuclear weapons would not be tolerated by the international community.  Still, North Korea responded in April 2013 by cutting off its connections with South Korea, ending its armistice, threatening to re-open its Yongbyon nuclear reactor, and issuing brazen threats against South Korea and the United States.   By May 2013, the political climate appeared to have cooled.  In June 2013, there was a bizarre mix of progress and retreat on the diplomatic front as the two Koreas  planned and then cancelled bilateral negotiations; however, North Korea then proposed direct talks with the United States.  In August  2013 through September 2013, the two Koreas finally agreed to re-open operations at the jointly administered Kaesong industrial zone. But once again, there was a mix of progress and retreat as by September 2013, signs pointed to the fact that operations were being restarted at North Korea's Yongbyon reactor.   The first part of 2014 was marked by a flurry of brazen activity by North Korea in the form of ballistic missile tests, threats of a ""new form"" nuclear test, and the exchange of fire with South Korean forces in the flashpoint disputed maritime region. Later in 2014, North Korea fired short range missiles on various occasions coinciding with visits to South Korea by world leaders, such as Chinese President Xi Jinping and Pope Francis.   In early 2015, with joint military exercises looming between the United States and South Korea, North Korea launched anti-ship missiles from hover ships. North Korea's news agency  published images showing  the hover ships launching a so-called ""cutting-edge anti-ship rocket"" that would be used to secure the contested marine border with South Korea.  At the time, there was speculation as to whether Pyongyang's moves were  acts  of belligerence aimed at improving North Korea's negotiating position for the future, or, if they were intended to be blatant and irrational acts of provocation.   On Jan. 6,  2016, North Korea carried out its fourth nuclear tests in flagrant violation of prevailing United Nations resolutions.  Then less than a year later on Sept. 9, 2016,  North Korea carried out its fifth nuclear test. It was the biggest blast to date and regarded as more powerful than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima.   With Pyongyang claiming to  have successfully  carried out  its first underground test of a miniaturized hydrogen bomb, the focus was not so much on Pyongyang's intent as it was on the international community's response.  Could the United Nations Security Council members close ranks and produce a new resolution?  And even if it was able to do so, would that document be any more capable of preventing North Korea from continued violations of international law?   The answers to those questions remained elusive.  Indeed, with Pyongyang carrying out its fifth nuclear test and again making miniaturization claims, it was clear that the current policy of containment regarding North Korea at the international level was at a dead end.   That dead end was underlined at the start of September 2017 when North Korea carried out its sixth nuclear test in flagrant defiance of international law.  North Korea claimed that it had successfully tested  a hydrogen bomb capable of fitting on an intercontinental ballistic missile and reaching the mainland United States.  The increased yield in this September 2017 test as compared with a nuclear test a year ago would suggest that this was North Korea's most powerful nuclear experiment to date.  To be sure, a thermonuclear device such as a hydrogen bomb would certainly surpass the destructive power of the atomic bombs that destroyed the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II.    North Korea holds the dubious distinction of being the only country to have performed a nuclear test in the 21st century.  The United States holds its own dubious distinction of being the only country to have used a nuclear weapon in war.      Editor's Note on North Korea's Nuclear Capability:   The main question is whether or not North Korea can make good on its threats against South Korea, other east Asian counties, as well as the United States, and its allies.   The vast majority of North Korea's missiles were believed to be short-range and medium-range Rodong missiles, rooted in Soviet-era Scud missiles.      Most nuclear experts believe that North Korea would be most likely  to place a nuclear warhead on a  medium-range Rodong missile, rather than an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM),  since  North Korea has no test history in that regard.  The general assessment was that North Korea had not yet made technological strides in building an ICBM capable of carrying a nuclear warhead.   It was clear that both South Korea and Japan were within range of potential North Korean missile attacks.   North Korea's medium-range Nodong 1, a single-stage liquid-propelled weapon based on Soviet ""Scud"" technology, could reach Japanese and South Korean targets, according to an International Institute for Strategic Studies overview of North Korea's missile program.  However, that technology was not known for its targeting prowess and was thus not to be regarded as a ""precision strike"" mechanism.   Obviously, at an even further distance, the Nodong 1 could not really be regarded as a serious threat against Guam. It was possible that North Korea could  deploy its multi-stage intermediate range ballistic missile, the Taepodong, against the United States base on Guam, but the record for the Taepodong was not stellar, even failing during flight testing.   In April 2013, North Korea moved a medium-range missile, known as a Musudan or Nodong B, to its east coast. It was  not known if there was a warhead mounted on the missile, or, if the movement of the missile was part of the preparations for yet another missile test. While this Musudan/Nodong B missile has a range of 3,000 kilometers (1,875 miles), which would put all of South Korea, Japan and possibly Guam in its range, there was no reliable test history to ensure precision.  A missile launch would ostensibly be aimed at acquiring that flight test history, thus driving South Korea to deploy warships with missile defense systems to the coasts.   It should be noted that the Kn-o8 missile was believed to have enough range to hit United States terrain such as Alaska, Hawaii, and Guam.  This missile was actually displayed at a recent North Korean military parade.  However, there were some suggestions that the missile was not yet viable, with some experts even suggesting it was only a ""mock-up"" missile.   The longer range option for North Korea would likely be the multi-stage rocket, the Unha-3, which was used to launch a satellite into space  in late 2012. Theoretically,  the Unha  -- with its range of 10,000 kilometers -- could deliver a nuclear warhead-sized payload as far as Alaska or Hawaii or even California.  However,  as noted by the Center for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS), previous launches of Unha-based rockets have not been terribly successful, raising questions about the technology's reliability.  Moreover,  unlike most intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICMBs) which use  solid fuel, the Unha-3 is powered by liquid fuel, which cannot  be stored for long periods inside the rocket.  Accordingly, the Unha-3 was a liquid-fueled rocket, it would have to sit on a launch pad for lengthy periods of time for fueling, leaving it essentially vulnerable to a strike. For all these reasons, the CNS has concluded that while the Unha was evidence of North Korea's missile capability, it was  not deemed to be ""a reliable system capable of delivering a nuclear weapon to the continental United States.""   Still,  the navy of South Korea obtained first stage debris from the 2012 Unha launch and concluded that North Korea had made some technological strides.  Notably, the missile showed a capacity for steering thanks to the use of small auxiliary engines instead of jet vanes.   Another consideration as regards North Korea's progress on nuclear development was the use of uranium versus plutonium in nuclear testing.  It is widely believed that North Korea  used plutonium as fissile material for nuclear tests undertaken in 2006 and 2009.  But there were suspicions by experts that  North Korea might have used uranium in its recent (February 2013) nuclear test. The use of uranium  could indicate North Korea's intent to expand its nuclear arsenal through uranium enrichment.   In 2013, the general consensus  was that North Korea had not  (yet) developed the technology to manufacture a  miniaturized nuclear device small enough to fit on a ballistic missile, which would be needed to carry out a nuclear attack on the United States.   North Korea has carried out nuclear weapons tests and has made it clear that future tests were in the offing. But producing a nuclear explosion was not the same as producing a nuclear device small enough to fit on the top of a missile that could be delivered across an extensive range of territory.  Indeed, not only do nuclear warheads have to be small enough to fit on a missile, they also have to be able to durable enough to withstand intense heat, as well as the vibration of re-entry, and they need to possess the precision to arrive at their intended targets.  As noted by  Greg Thielmann, a senior fellow at the Arms Control Association, ""Based on the testing we've seen and some other assumptions about North Korean abilities, we don't think they're ready to arm an ICBM with a nuclear warhead yet even if they had an ICBM, which they don't yet.""   That being said, a new assessment of North Korea's nuclear capability conducted by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA)  of the Pentagon  concluded with ""moderate confidence"" that North Korea had, for the first time, learned how to manufacture a nuclear weapon small enough to be delivered via a ballistic missile.  The precise language used by the Defense Intelligence Agency was as follows: ""North currently has nuclear weapons capable of delivery by ballistic missiles however the reliability will be low.""   The assessment,  portions of which were publicized in a report by the New York Times on April 11, 2013, was a sobering and disturbing revelation at a time of heightened tensions on the Korean peninsular.   Related to this report was emerging insight derived from debris from the rocket used by the North Koreans to launch a satellite into space in December 2012.  The United States Navy was able to retrieve the front section of the rocket for study by experts, thus contributing to assessments about possible warhead designs by the North Koreans. According to media reports, that front section of the satellite rocket offered scientists evidence that North Korea was manufacturing the missile's cone at dimensions suitable for a nuclear warhead, and intended to function on a long-range missile capable of re-entry to the earth's atmosphere from space.   Anxieties over this possible benchmark by the North Koreans were likely to be assuaged by the general view that such a nuclear weapon would likely be hampered by low reliability -- a plausible deduction given North Korea's poor record of developing accurate weapons and its limited test history of missiles in its possession. As well, even if North Korea did make technological strides and was now able to make a deliverable warhead, it would still have to be able to withstand intense heat and the vibration of re-entry, and would to be sufficiently tested for target precision, as noted above.  To that end, North Korea has no test history of a re-entry vehicle and without that functional technology, it cannot deliver a warhead.   In  recent years, North Korea has made claims of miniaturization.  In 2014, then-commander of United States Forces Korea, General Curtis Scaparrotti, expressed the view that North Korea  had the capability to miniaturize a warhead.  At the time, he was on the record saying, ""I believe they have the capability to have miniaturized a device at this point, and they have the technology to potentially actually deliver what they say they have.""  A year later, in 2015, North Korea was making the bold claim that it was able to miniaturize nuclear weapons.     Then, in January 2016, North Korea claimed that  successfully carried out its first underground test of a miniaturized hydrogen bomb.  While experts have discounted North Korea's claim of thermonuclear strides, and concluded that North Korea more likely tested a boosted fission device rather than a hydrogen bomb, there was  not enough verifiable data available to prove of disprove the miniaturization assertion by North Korea.   Meanwhile, it should be noted that in a report to the United States Congress at the start of May 2013,  the United States Department of Defense made clear that North Korea was aiming to move closer to its goal of striking the United States  with a nuclear-armed missile.  There was no estimate as to when North Korea might achieve that capability; however, the report surmised that progress on this front would be dependent on North Korea's degree of investment in its military program.  And to that end, North Korea was believed to be committed to becoming a nuclear powerhouse, irrespective of its domestic challenges of famine, starvation, and economic strife. The report emphasized the view that North Korea's key strategic aim was to deploy  ""coercive diplomacy"" to force the international community to accept its nuclear ambitions.  No reference in this report was made of the aforementioned conclusions of the DIA.   For its part, the United States government has long maintained the position that it has the ability to protect the homeland. To that end, in mid-March 2013, the Obama administration in the United States said it would deploy additional ballistic-missile interceptors along the country's Pacific Coast, with an eye on protecting the United States from a potential attack from North Korea. The deployment of  additional ballistic-missile interceptors  would increase the number (currently based in California and Alaska) from 30 to 44. As well, the United States  moved its  sea-based  X-Band radar platform, normally based in Hawaii, closer to the North Korean coast, with the intent of monitoring  potential attempts from North Korea to launch a long-range missile.  The radar system also possesses the capability to search and track targets, as well as communicate with interceptor missiles at overseas bases that can shoot down  missiles.  By April 2013, the United States  decided to deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense system to Guam.   The anti-ballistic missile interceptor system and the X-Band radar platform  do not  guarantee protection against a possible North Korean attack; however, they are intended to deter Pyongyang, which has been known to have only a limited intercontinental ballistic missile arsenal.  Experts have concluded that  North Korea simply does not have the military capability to carry out a nuclear strike on United States territory.   In May 2013, in an effort to show that the United States was fully prepared to defend itself from the potential nuclear missile threat posed by North Korea or any other belligerent nation state, the Missile Defense Agency along with the United States Navy  completed a successful test of a missile defense system as it destroyed a target launched in the Pacific Ocean.  According to  the  Department of Defense, a short-range ballistic missile target was launched  from the Pacific Missile Range Facility on the Hawaiian island of Kauai;  the USS Lake Erie was able to  detect and track the missile, then launch a blocking missile with a kinetic warhead, which successfully destroyed the target.  United States officials said the test operation in Hawaii demonstrated that the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense system was fully functional.   Should a confrontation actually emerge, North Korea would be helped by the fact that its  army is the fifth largest in the world; however,  it is also inexperienced having not seen combat since 1953, and having been deprived of the superior and sophisticated training available to the smaller South Korean military, or the extensive United States military industrial complex.  As well, a great deal of North Korea's military equipment is outdated in comparison to Western powers.  That being said, even outdated military equipment can still (presumably) function and thus North Korea poses  a real and serious threat to global security.    Retired United States Admiral Dennis Blair, a former head of the United States Pacific Command and  director of national intelligence in the Obama administration, cautioned against taking a sanguine stance in response to the North Korean threat posed in 2013.  He said in an interview with Bloomberg News, ""I'm not relaxed about this one...I think this one's more dangerous.""   Most experts on North Korea posit the view that Pyongyang is not really prepared to ignite a conflict that would ensure its own destruction; however, they note that Kim Jong-un's inexperience could lead to misunderstanding and miscalculations with potentially catastrophic consequences.  For example, regardless of its intended target, a missile launched by the North that appears to be headed towards South Korea or Japan -- accidentally or otherwise -- would clearly yield a response from those countries or the United States.  That response could itself be a catalyst for a deadly confrontation among players armed with no shortage of conventional weapons,  not to mention nuclear bombs.   Indeed, Admiral Samuel J. Locklear, the top United States commander in the Pacific, said during testimony before the Senate Armed Services committee on April 9, 2013, that while the United States would not opt to shoot down a North Korean missile aimed for open waters, interceptors would be used to defend against a North Korean missile perceived as threatening the interests of the United States or its allies.  It was an unknown matter as to how a paranoid regime like North Korea would itself respond to such defensive action.   Meanwhile, as noted by then-United States Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel of his country's ability to respond to threats posed by North Korea: ""We have every capacity to deal with any action that North Korea would take, to protect this country and the interests of this country and our allies."" At the same news conference with Hagel,  General Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the United States military Joint Chiefs of Staff,  would not say if he believe North Korea had been able to make a nuclear warhead small enough to fit onto a ballistic missile; however, he warned that the United States need to be prepared for the worst possible scenarios.  Dempsey said: ""They [the North Koreans] have conducted two nuclear tests. They have conducted several successful ballistic missile launches. And in the absence of concrete evidence to the contrary, we have to assume the worst case, and that's why we're postured as we are today.""   In 2014, North Korea was showing little restraint on the matter of ballistic missile tests and was now threatening to carry out another  nuclear test -- this one of a ""new form"" variety.  Once again, in keeping with Martin Dempsey's prudent warning mentioned just above -- in the absence of clear data regarding North Korea's nuclear capabilities and recent technological strides, the global community interested in security and stability would do well not to dismiss North Korea as simply indulging in saber rattling.   The 2016 nuclear test carried out by North Korea would underline this warning in stark terms.   In 2016, following North Korea's claim of having produced a hydrogen bomb, along with its launch of the  Kwangmyongsong-4  satellite  into space, questions about North Korea's intercontinental ballistic missile technology, capable of delivering a nuclear bomb, again surfaced.  Of note was the question of whether or not North Korea could dispatch a nuclear-armed missile to a target in another country, such as Japan or the United States.  As before this question focused on the matter of whether or not  North Korea's  intercontinental ballistic missile technology was capable of transporting a nuclear payload accurately over  a long distances.   In truth, only intense testing for reliability could guarantee such an end and North Korea's test history remained limited.  But even satellite launch -- even failed ones -- provide data for missile technology experts and that fact cannot be ignored.  Still, North Korea would have to be able to successfully develop a  miniaturized nuclear weapons that could fit on the top of a rocket, and it would also have to be stable enough to withstand intense heat and  re-entry into the atmosphere.   There were some fears being expressed by United States experts that North Korea had made strides in the miniaturization process; however, the government of the United States has insisted this was not the case.   The ""re-entry"" aspect was also unsettled as some experts have suggested that North Korea  may well have developed a ""re-entry vehicle.""  Of course the remaining problem for North Korea was that there was little guarantee that its missiles could be delivered with reliability and accuracy.   Given these considerations, back in 2015, the United States National Security Council spokesperson, Patrick Ventrell, issued the following statement:  ""Our assessment of North Korea's nuclear capabilities has not changed. We do not think that they have that capacity.""  He added, ""However, they are working on developing a number of long-range missiles, including intercontinental ballistic missiles, that could eventually threaten our allies and the homeland.""   That warning could only be understood as even more pertinent in 2016 when an assessment by South Korea indicated that North Korea may have developed a miniaturized nuclear warhead on a medium-range missile.  That news, if true, would bolster North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's claims  that his country had developed miniaturized nuclear warheads that could be mounted on ballistic missiles.       Of course, there was actually no conclusive evidence of the assessment discussed by South Korea.  Nevertheless, there seemed to be a willingness to consider the risk posed by North Korea as real.  At a Pentagon briefing in the United States, Pentagon spokesperson Captain Jeff Davis said, ""We know that they've said they have that capability, and we have to take them at their word.  But we have not seen them demonstrate it, so we don't share that assessment necessarily but we do accept what they say as a threat we need to take as real.""   By the first half of 2017, United States defense officials were making clear that there was a need to  strengthen the country's missile defenses in Hawaii.  In testimony before members of Congress, Admiral Harry Harris, the leading  commander in the Pacific, said this would be needed in response to the grave threat posed by North Korea's missile and nuclear weapons programs. While some have dismissed the notion of North Korea being able to strike United States territory as ludicrous, the fact was that Pyongyang had been extending its nuclear technology and advancing its knowledge, via its intensified test activity.  To this end, Harris noted that while defenses of Hawaii were likely sufficient at this time, there would be a need for new radar and interceptors to intercept incoming North Korean missiles in the future.     In July 2017, North Korea's two intercontinental ballistic (ICBM) missile tests indicated that the Pyongyang had the range capability to hit the United States.  The salve for the United States was the fact that North Korea's lack of guidance technology meant that it was not guaranteed to accurately hit its target. Limited solace could also be found in the fact that  there was little evidence that North Korea possessed the technological ability to launch a miniaturized nuclear warhead attached to a missile. Likewise, there was a limited test history demonstrating that North Korean missiles were capable of re-entry.   By August 2017, confidential analysis by the Defense Intelligence Agency, as reported in the  Washington Post, indicated that  North Korea had successfully produced a miniaturized nuclear warhead that could be attached to a ballistic missile.  The production of a miniaturized nuclear warhead  capable of being attached to a ballistic missile would mark a significant technological breakthrough for North Korea.   It would quite literally set North Korea on the final path to being a nuclear power, thus making that country an even more pressing threat to global security, and certainly a clear and present danger to the United States homeland.   While there was some confidence that the capability of North Korea's miniaturized nuclear warhead remained relatively untested, the two test launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) in July 2017 alone made clear that North Korea was building on its test launch experience.    These breakthrough developments would ultimately lead North Korea progressively down the path of eventually being able to successfully launch  a nuclear capable missile and strike a key target.  Such a move would yield catastrophic consequences for the overall state of global security.    In an alarming development at the start of September 2017, North Korea carried out its sixth nuclear test in flagrant defiance of international law.  North Korea claimed that it had successfully tested  a hydrogen bomb capable of fitting on an intercontinental ballistic missile and reaching the mainland United States.    The increased yield in this September 2017 test as compared with a nuclear test a year ago would suggest that this was North Korea's most powerful nuclear experiment to date.  To be sure, a thermonuclear device such as a hydrogen bomb would certainly surpass the destructive power of the atomic bombs, using fission, that destroyed the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II.     A boosted atomic bomb would use some thermonuclear fuel inside the atomic core. A layered atomic bomb would use more thermonuclear fuel outside the atomic core.  A thermonuclear device, or  hydrogen bomb (H-bomb), though, would use sufficient hydrogen fuel that would be ignited by the atomic core and magnify the impact.  Using nuclear fusion, atoms would be fuse together, release greater quantities of energy. A two-stage process called a thermonuclear reaction would  utilize an initial nuclear fission explosion and then  a fusion bomb, ultimately producing an exponentially more devastating effect.    This apparent test of a hydrogen bomb by North Korea in September 2017 would indicate increasing sophistication of that country's nuclear program and evidence of it being a clear and present danger to global security.    Note that in the aftermath of the hydrogen test in September 2017, North Korea carried out another missile launch.  Then, in November 2017, North Korea launched an ICBM that showed strides in height and range, underlying the fact that it could potentially reach any part of the United States, and indeed, the world.  The only comfort to the international community was the knowledge that there was no definitive sign that North Korea possessed the necessary payload and re-entry capacity to reliably deliver a weaponized missile to any part of the world.           -- January 2018 Written by Dr. Denise Youngblood Coleman, Editor in Chief, www.countrywatch.com ; see Bibliography for research sources used to compose this Country Review.",264,"Pyongyang also agreed to accept inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the nuclear watchdog agency of the United Nations.",0.2380552142858505,8.407433986663817,2

",621632,"General Relations During most of the Cold War period, South Korea pursued a foreign policy of being in concert with the Western countries. Placing efforts in improving relations with the Western countries, South Korea also tried to build cooperative relations with the developing countries. After the Cold War ended, South Korea began to promote a ""Northern Diplomacy"" aimed at enhancing ties with former socialist countries. The ""Northern Diplomacy"" proved to be successful, and relations with the Soviet Union and China were normalized in a short time.

In August 1991, South Korea joined the United Nations (U.N.) along with North Korea. Since then South Korea has been active in most U.N.-specialized agencies and many international forums. In 1996, South Korea became a member of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). At the end of 1997, it completed a term as a nonpermanent member of the U.N. Security Council.  In 2006, South Korean Foreign Minister Ban Ki-moon was nominated and confirmed as the new United Nations Secretary General.South Korea's relationship with North Korea has been a central political and diplomatic issue. Since the 1970s South Korea has pursued a policy of promoting independent and peaceful reunification of the Korean Peninsula. Under President Kim Dae-jung's Sunshine Policy, dramatic changes took place in the relations between the two Koreas, most encouragingly shown in the first-ever South-North summit in June 2000.  In recent years, under the new president, it is difficult to know if improved bilateral relations will soon ensue, given the nuclear threat of a nuclear North Korea and the influence of hardline United States policies in opposition to the North. Regional Relations Relations with North Korea  For decades after the Korean War, both Korean governments had repeatedly reiterated their desire to reunify the Korean Peninsula. Until 1971, however, the two governments had no direct contacts or communications. In 1972, a series of secret meetings resulted in the announcement of an agreement by South and North Korea aimed at working toward peaceful reunification and an end to the hostile atmosphere prevailing on the peninsula. In 1994, after former U.S. President Carter's visit to North Korea in June, North and South Korea agreed to hold a summit in July. The two sides went ahead with plans for the summit, but it was canceled because of Kim Il Sung's sudden death on July 8, 1994. In April 2000, the governments of the two Koreas reached an agreement to hold the first-ever summit in Pyongyang.From June 13-15, 2000, North Korean leader Kim Jong il and South Korean President Kim Dae-jung held the summit in Pyongyang, the first since the end of the Korean War in the 1950s. The two leaders reached a historic agreement during the summit to reduce tensions between the two sides of the peninsula and work toward the reunification. The two leaders also agreed that North Korean leader Kim Jong il would pay a return visit to South Korea in the near future. Since the June summit, considerable achievements have been made in improving relationship between North and South Korea. From August 2000 to February 2001, three rounds of family reunion events took place in the Korean Peninsula. The two Koreas  also started working on the transport re-link between the two sides by reconnecting the railway between the capital cities of the two. Government officials from North and South Korea kept in contact since the summit, holding meetings regularly to discuss matters of reunification and cooperation. The scenario changed in 2002, according to some (but not all)analysts with the decision by the United States to classify the North as part of an ""axis of evil.""  The North responded by withdrawing from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation  Treaty and restarting its nuclear development. Whether or not North Korea's actual reason for withdrawing from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty was the perceived hostility from the hardline Bush administration in the United States, it is fair to state that rapprochement between the North and South was halted, with most contemporary efforts focused on multilateral talks aimed at brining some resolution to the current nuclear standoff discussed in the ""Political Conditions"" of this review.  In July 2006, North Korea test-fired a number of short-range missiles and one Taepodong-2 long-range missile into the Sea of Japan (known as the East Sea by Koreans). The situation sparked international condemnation and threats of punitive measures by some countries, including sanctions. In South Korea, the government in Seoul convened an emergency cabinet meeting and placed its military on high alert.  For its part, North Korea said  that further missile tests would be launched.  North Korea also warned that it would react strongly to punitive pressures from the international community, and it threatened to carry out an ""annihilating"" nuclear strike if its atomic facilities were pre-emptively hit by the United States.The missile tests, in conjunction with dire promises of further tests and a nuclear strike, intensified the widely-held view that North Korea is a threat to global security. Moreover, these moves by North Korea effectively served to further isolate the country and confirm its pariah status within the international community.  The impact on relations with South Korea was yet to be determined.  However, the country was quick to distance itself from a hard-line Japanese draft resolution that provided for economic and military sanctions against North Korea.  Indeed, South Korea went so far as to describe the Japanese draft as ""reckless.""  In mid-July 2006, the United Nations condemned North Korea for carrying out a series of missile tests earlier in the month. The United Nations Security Council also issued a resolution demanding that North Korea cease activities related to its ballistic missile program and prohibiting all United Nations member states from supplying that country with any weapons-related materials.  The resolution passed unanimously after a reference to Chapter Seven of the United Nations Charter was removed.  That reference would authorize sanctions and military action and would be legally binding.  Its removal ensured that there would be complete support from among Security Council members.South Korea called on the North to issue a moratorium on missile tests and return to the multilateral negotiating table. For its part, however, North Korea angrily rejected the resolution and vowed to further develop its military arsenal as a means to ""bolster its war deterrent.""In the first week of October 2006, North Korea said that it intended to test  a nuclear weapon. A week after issuing this threat,  North Korea announced that it had indeed conducted its first nuclear weapons test.  North Korea's state-controlled news agency declared,  ""The nuclear test is a historic event that brought happiness to our military and people.""  The message in the state-controlled media also went on to assert that the nuclear test would, ""contribute to maintaining peace and stability in the Korean peninsula and surrounding region."" The South Korean news agency, Yonhap, suggested that the explosion may have occurred in an area called Gilju in North Korea's Hamgyong province.The apparent test took place in defiance of warnings by the international community not to go through with the test.  In response, South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun scheduled an emergency meeting of his National Security Council.  The meeting was convened to address the serious shift in the security scenario on the Korean peninsula.  Only  days before, South Korean troops fired warning shots at North Korean soldiers when they crossed into the demilitarized zone.  It was not clear whether the North Koreans' actions were calculated or accidental.  Regardless, they were emblematic of the increasing climate of tension on the Korean peninsula, which reached an unprecedented high following the apparent nuclear test. Meanwhile, Japan's new head of government, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, was expected to discuss the matter with his South Korean counterpart in Seoul.  Prime Minister Abe and Chinese Premier Hu Jintao had previously met in Beijing to discuss regional concerns and had jointly issued their opposition to the notion of a nuclear test by North Korea.  Clearly, their joint statement went unheeded by Pyongyang.Regardless of motivation, the effects of the nuclear test augured negatively.  Apart from destabilizing the region, analysts warned that it could potentially halt any progress on reconciliation between the two Koreas, and it could well spark an arms race.Meanwhile, at the United Nations work was being done to craft a resolution that would be passed in the Security Council authorizing punitive action against North Korea.  A draft document by the United States underwent revisions to accommodate the reservations of China and Russia.  Those two countries had stated that they would not support the military enforcement of financial and security sanctions against North Korea.  With adjustments made, the United Nations Security Council unanimously approved Resolution 1718 on October 14, 2006.  The resolution called for  the inspections on cargo going to and from North Korea to search for weapons, a ban on the sale or transfer of materials related to North Korea's unconventional weapons program, and a freeze on the transfer of funds connected with North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.  Absent from Resolution 1718 was the Chapter Seven [of the United Nations charter] provision, which would enforce the sanctions via military force.In late January 2007, it was announced that six-party talks on North Korea's nuclear program would resume.A previous round of talks ensued in December 2006 but ended inconclusively. In the background of such developments was the testing of a nuclear device by North Korea in the fall of 2006.  That action did little to bolster Pyongyang's case for its right to a nuclear program, and overshadowed prevailing hopes that North Korea might abandon its nuclear ambitions and rejoin the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in exchange for economic aid and security guarantees.By February, 2007, it was announced that concurrence had been reached.  North Korea agreed to shut down its nuclear facilities at Yongbyon within 60 days in exchange for 50,000 tonnes of fuel oil or economic aid of equal value, with 950,000 tonnes of fuel oil or equivalent received after further disarmament steps are taken.  Yet to be seen was whether or not the agreement would be ratified by all six parties, and also whether or not North Korea would fully comply with the provisions of the deal.In the third week of June 2007, North Korea reportedly agreed to shut down its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon and, then, disable its nuclear facilities.  North Korea also noted that it was inviting International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors to return to North Korea to monitor the closure of its nuclear program and facilities.  To that end, IAEA inspectors were expected to visit North Korea on June 26, 2007, for the first time since their dismissal from that country in 2002.These announcements came months after the Chinese drafted an agreement in February 2007 (discussed above), in which the closure of the reactor at Yongbyon would be secured, in lieu of heavy fuel oil that would be secured by other countries participating in the multilateral nuclear disarmament talks.The total amount of fuel oil -- one million metric tons -- appeared to more substantial that the original quantity discussed earlier in the year under the Chinese-brokered plan.  In addition, diplomatic recognition and humanitarian aid benefits were included in the deal.  Also included in the arrangement was the untangling of a financial dispute.A new round of six-party disarmament talks, which has included North Korea, South Korea, China, Japan, Russia and the United States, was set to commence in July 2007.In mid-July 2007, North Korea said that it shut down its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon.  A team of inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was monitoring the situation at Yongbyon in order to verify Pyongyang's claim.  Nevertheless, the announcement was welcomed by the countries of the West, the wider world, and particularly by the countries participating in multilateral talks with North Korea aimed at disarmament.In October 2007, South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun and the North Korea's leader Kim Jong-ilsigned a joint declaration calling for a permanent peace agreement on the Korean Peninsula.The eight-point declaration set forth an agenda for international dialogue aimed at crafting a treaty, which would replace the existing armistice that brought an end to the Korean War that took place from 1950 to 1953.  The two Korean leaders signed the declaration following a historic summit in Pyongyang and issued the following statement, ""The South and North share the view that they should end the current armistice system and build up a permanent peace system.""

The declaration also came on the heels of a significant announcement by North Korea that it would end its nuclear ambitions.  To that end, Pyongyang formally agreed to a timetable for the disabling of its nuclear facilities.   Pyongyang also agreed to disclose details about its nuclear program by the close of 2007. North Korea was scheduled to surrender its stockpile of nuclear weaponry in 2008.    In July 2008, a South Korean woman was shot to death by a North Korean soldier.  North Korean authorities said that the 53-year old woman strayed from  the special tourism zone in the mountains  into a restricted area of the Mount Kumgang resort.  More than one million South Korean visitors have traveled to the resort, which is located in a strategic nazal area,  in the last decade without any such incident occurring.  South Korean authorities responded by suspending cross-border trips, pending an investigation.  Because cross-border tourism trips have been the fulcrum of economic and cultural cooperation in the last decade, the incident had the potential to adversely affect cross-border relations.  It was viewed as a setback at a time when South Korean President Lee Myung-bak has advocated  fresh dialogue with North Korea.    October 2008  saw the United States move to remove North Korea from its list of state-sponsors of terrorism.  The development came after multilateral talks between North Korea, the United States, China, South Korea, Russia and Japan and appeared to end some dissonance that had  been brewing in recent months, despite multilateral concurrence on North Korean disarmament.    The start of 2009 was marked on the Korean peninsula by devolving relations between Pyongyang and Seoul.  At issue has been the more hard-line approach taken by South Korea's President Lee Myung-Bak in the last year since coming to power.  Significantly, the South Korean president reversed the ""sunshine"" policy bestowed aid to North Korea.  President Lee said that economic assistance would now be dependent on North Korea's willingness to completely end its nuclear weapons program.

North Korea responded with outrage at the change. In January 2009, North Korea announced that it had enough plutonium stocks to produce four or five nuclear weapons. The third week of January 2009  saw North Korea warn South Korea that its ""confrontational"" policies could lead to retaliation by the nuclear power. Military authorities in Pyongyang told Seoul that it would bolster its ""nuclear deterrent force"" in the face of perceived threats. In response, South Korean authorities called for amplified troop strength. At the start of February 2009, it was reported that North Korea was preparing to test-fire the long-range Taepodong-2 missile. Then, by mid-month, North Korea was declaring its right to launch a ""space program."" Since North Korea has, in the past, characterized rocket launches in similar terms, it was believed that the term ""space program"" was associated with the anticipated missile launch.   

On the other side of the equation, South Korea's President Lee Myung-Bak has eschewed beginning negotiations from too-conciliatory a stance, cautioning previous South Korean leaders had gone down that path with no substantial end result to show for those efforts. That said, the South Korean president did not foreclose re-entering peace talks with the North. To that end, he said, in a national radio address ""I am very aware there are people who are concerned about the recent series of North Korean threats. But you do not need to worry too much. The government is ready to sit down with North Korea at any time and resolve every issue.""

Multilateral talks aimed at halting North Korea's nuclear ambitions in exchange for aid saw some progress in recent years, however, the diplomatic efforts have slowed more recently. Indeed, the stance by the new South Korean leader, which was crafted by his nominee for Unification Minister, Hyun In-taek, appears to have brought diplomacy to a halt. In fact, North Korea has threatened to end all talks with the South if Hyun was confirmed for the job.

Amidst this growing imbroglio, some analysts have said that efforts by the Obama administration in the United States could potentially thaw increasingly cold relations between the two Koreas. Obama's Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, was scheduled to travel to Asia in mid-February 2009.  See below for details about relations with the United States and impact on peninsula relations.  At the start of February 2009, it was reported that North Korea was preparing to test-fire the long-range Taepodong-2 missile. Then, by mid-month, North Korea was declaring its right to launch a satellite as part of its ""space program."" Since North Korea has, in the past, characterized rocket launches in similar terms, it was believed that the term ""space program"" or satellite launch was associated with the anticipated missile launch.

In  March 2009, North Korea was threatening to go to war with any entity that tried to shoot down the (aforementioned) satellite it intended to launch. A statement by the North Korean military read, ""We will retaliate any act of intercepting our satellite for peaceful purposes with prompt counter-strikes by the most powerful military means.""  It also included the following assertion: ""Shooting our satellite for peaceful purposes will precisely mean a war.""  In a presumed effort to augment its warning, North Korea said its military was placed on full combat alert.  This warning came  at a time when scheduled joint military exercises between South Korea and the United States were about to commence.   Meanwhile, the newly-appointed United States envoy to North Korea, Stephen Bosworth, who was in Asia to revitalize six-party denuclearization talks, noted that a launch by North Korea would be ""ill advised."" 

In early April 2009, North Korea said that its attempt to launch a satellite into orbit ended in failure with parts of the rocket landing in the Pacific Ocean. But such an end did little to quell the international outcry. Throughout, the United States and South Korea have said that North Korea's claim of launching a satellite in space was just a cover for an actual missile test of the Taepodong-2. Accordingly, they have urged the United Nations Security Council to issue a strong response at an impending emergency session, which was called by Japan. The United States, South Korea and Japan regard the launch to be an abrogation of United Nations Security Resolution 1718, which in 2006 banned North Korea from ballistic missile activity. On the other side of the equation, China and Russia have advocated a restrained and measured response.  Late in April 2009, North Korea announced that it was withdrawing from multilateral disarmament talks and restarting its operations at the Yongbyon nuclear plant. This decision to withdraw from the negotiating table and resume reprocessing spent fuel rods came after the United Nations (UN) Security Council decided to impose sanctions on three North Korean companies.  That decision by the UN Security Council was reached in the aftermath of a controversial missile launch.  North Korea maintained that it had simply launched a satellite in space and so characterized the international reaction as""a wanton violation of the UN charter.""  On May 25, 2009, North Korea said that it had successfully conducted an underground nuclear test.  Several independent entities confirmed that a powerful explosion had been registered,  resulting in the conclusion that it was caused by the nuclear test.  The actual location of the testing was unknown but South Korea noted that a seismic tremor had been detected in the north-eastern part of the country close to Kilju.Geopolitical analysts were trying to determine why North Korea had chosen to move from negotiations to a clearly confrontational stance.  Two years earlier, North Korea agreed to close its nuclear facility at Yongbyong and comply with international monitoring of its nuclear assets.  In exchange, it was to be the recipient of a generous aid package.Later, however, North Korea withdrew from long-running multilateral negotiations and stopped inspectors from monitoring  progress related to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.

There was some speculation that after a woeful harvest, with up to a quarter of the North Korean population in desperate need of food aid, according to the World Food Programme, Pyongyang may have been trying to divert attention from this internal crisis.  There was also some suggestion that the domestic worries may have prompted an internal power struggle, which ultimately may have spurred this action by hard-liner within the regime.

For its part, Pyongyang appeared to indicate its motive via a communique announced on state radio, which asserted that the underground nuclear testing had been ""successfully conducted... as part of measures to enhance the Republic's self-defensive nuclear deterrent in all directions.""  The statement went on to note that the test was intended to ""contribute to safeguard the sovereignty of the country and the nation and socialism.""  Pyongyang also offered assurances that the underground nuclear testing had ensued in a safe manner with advanced technology.

International news agencies reported that in addition to the underground nuclear test, North Korea also test-fired two short-range missiles.  There were reports that the test firing of these missiles was aimed at disrupting the ability of United States' surveillance of the nuclear testing.

The international community -- including reliable allies of North Korea, such as China and Russia -- reacted with outrage and condemnation to these collective actions, which occurred  just a month after North Korea test fired a long-range missile capable of reaching Asia as well as parts of the United States. Crisis talks were convened in South Korea.  A spokesman for South Korean President Lee Myung-bak said that North Korea's decision to conduct nuclear testing  was a ""grave challenge"" to international non-proliferation efforts. 

Russia, which was at the helm of the rotating presidency, called for an emergency session of the United Nations (UN) Security Council, noting that North Korea had violated UN Security Council Resolution 1718. Indeed, UN Security Council Resolution 1718 exists in tandem with Article 41 of Chapter VII of the UN Charter and compels compliance by all member states.  A nuclear test would be an unassailable violation of UN Security Resolution 1718, which itself imposed sanctions in North Korea after it conducted a previous test in 2006.

Not surprisingly, the UN Security Council rapidly reacted with a strenuous statement of condemnation, registering North Korea's contravention of the resolution, demanding that North Korea return to multilateral talks aimed at denuclearization, and reminding all member states that they must comply  with sanctions imposed on North Korea.  The UN Security Council also made clear that further action, in the form of a new resolution with stronger measures, was in the offing.On May 27, 2009, the North Korean military announced that it was abandoning the armistice that brought an end to Korean War.The North Korean military said that this action was being taken in response to South Korea's decision to participate in  the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI).  North Korea said that South Korea's decision to join PSI --  a United States-led effort to patrol the oceans in search of nuclear weapons -- was tantamount to a ""declaration of war"" and promised military action if its shipping vessels were intercepted.  In another development, South Korean media reported that steam had been observed emanating from North Korea's nuclear plant at Yongbyon -- a sign indicating North Korea had decided to recommence the manufacture of weapons-grade plutonium.Attention returned to geopolitics in June 2009 when the United Nations Security Council decided to impose harsh new sanctions against North Korea in response to the nuclear test carried out in May 2009.  Included in the new sanctions regime was the expected provision for the increased inspection of North Korean cargo not only on shipping vessels, but also on land and by air, and it authorized the destruction of any materials suspected of being linked to weapons of mass destruction. The new sanctions regime also expanded the arms embargo against North Korea, effectively prohibiting the sale of heavy and small arms by North Korea.

Undeterred, North Korea was said to be preparing for another missile test into the Pacific.  As well,  the United States military was reportedly tracking a North Korean ship -- the Kang Nam 1 -- under suspicion of carrying banned cargo.  At issue was the heightened sanctions regime approved by the United Nations Security Council, which provided for the increased inspection of North Korean cargo by all United Nations member states, the destruction of any materials suspected of being linked to weapons of mass destruction, and a complete prohibition of the sale of heavy and small arms by North Korea.On July 2, 2009, North Korea test-fired four short-range missiles.  According to South Korea's Yonhap News Agency,  two surface-to-ship missiles had been fired from the port of Wonsan while the other two were launched  from Sinsang-ni.  All four were fired into the Sea of Japan, which South Korea regards as the ""East Sea.""  The missile tests were not surprising as Pyongyang issued warnings to shipping vessels, urging them to avoid coastal waters.  Two days later, North Korea was suspected of firing another seven ballistic missiles.  These seven  Scud-type missiles were launched from an east coast base and, as before, fell into the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea.

The timing of the missile tests coincided with the United States' celebration of its  Independence Day on July 4, 2009, and was regarded as a clear act of defiance against Washington.  Nevertheless, the United States was joined by Russia and China in calling for calm.  Russia and China urged North Korea to return to the negotiating table and said all parties should work to avoid further destabilization of the region.  The United States also said that the tense situation should not be exacerbated. Using highly restrained language, a United States Department of State official said the volley of missile tests were ""not helpful"" and said that North Korea should not ""aggravate tensions"" but instead ""focus on denuclearization talks.""  While British Foreign Secretary David Miliband echoed this sentiment by saying that tensions on t he Korean peninsula should remain ""at manageable levels,"" Japan and South Korea struck a somewhat harsher tone in saying that the missile launches constituted  an ""act of provocation."" South Korea and  North Korea agreed to the arrange reunions for separated families from either side of the Korean peninsula.  The reunions were scheduled to be held  from September 26, 2009  to October 1, 2009 in the Mount Gumgang area.The agreement was forged following talks between  delegates from the respective Red Cross societies in North Korea and South Korea.A joint statement read as follows:""The South and the North will continue to cooperate on the issue of separated families and other humanitarian issues involving the Red Cross.""The program of reuniting Korean families commenced in 2000 following a landmark inter-Korean summit.  Since that time, the two sides have held several reunions and orchestrated a number of  video exchanges although the last such meetings took place in October 2007.  Soon thereafter, South Korea's hard line government of President Lee Myung-bak came to power, bilateral relations devolved, and the program was suspended.  This 2009 agreement could be  illustrative of a possible  breakthrough between the two sides. On  October 12, 2009, North Korea fired  five short-range missiles into Sea of Japan (also known as the East Sea).  The surface-to-surface KN-02 missiles with a range of 75 miles  were launched south of Musudan-ri in the North Hamgyeong Province.  As a precaution, North Korea had banned shipping vessels from the waters off the east and west coasts from October 10 to October 20, 2009, according to the Yonhap news agency.  It was the first missile launches by North Korea  in several months  and came after North Korea said that it was willing to return to multilateral talks about its nuclear program. On November 10, 2009, South Korean and North Korean ships exchanged heavy fire at sea in South Korean waters when a North Korean patrol boat traversed the Northern Limit Line, which demarcates the boundary between the two Koreas.The exchange of fire was described as having lasted only for a short period of time and left a North Korean vessel in flames but with no casualties on the South Korean side. There was no information available on the casualties -- if any -- from Pyongyang.  Whereas the South Korean authorities characterized the incident as ""accidental,"" the North Koreans said it was an ""armed provocation.""

Despite this incident, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that talks between Washington and Pyongyang would go forward, as planned.  Speaking at the  Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation  summit in Singapore, Secretary Clinton said,  ""This does not in any way affect the decision to send ambassador Bosworth. We think that this is an important step that stands on its own.""   To that end, Bosworth was expected to travel to Pyongyang  for direct talks with the North Koreans following the Asia-Pacific summit. It would be the first direct contact between the United States and North Korea in more than a year.  On the agenda during that meeting would be the matter of North Korea's return to the stalled six-party talks on denuclearization. By early 2010, North Korea indicated that part of the new phase of negotiations on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula should include a new peace treaty to replace the armistice that ended the Korean War.  North Korea said that a peace agreement should form the fulcrum of  negotiations on this matter and should be addressed prior to the return to six-party talks aimed at ending Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program, or, as a central part of those multilateral negotiations.   On January 29, 2010, North Korea reportedly fired artillery shells in the area of the Yellow Sea, close to the country's  maritime border with South Korea.  It was third day that North Korea had carried out such action, according to the South Korean military.  Speculation abounded that the provocative action by North Korea may have been aimed at forcing the United States and South Korea to respond to its proposal for a peace treaty to officially end the Korean War, which has effectively ceased via a prevailing armistice rather than an actual peace agreement.  North Korea, as discussed above,  has argued that it cannot advance further denuclearization talks without the foundation of a peace treaty. 

In late March 2010, North Korea accused South Korea  of carrying out  psychological warfare by facilitating journalist tours in the demilitarized border zone between the two countries..  North Korea warned South Korea that there would be repercussions for these actions, claiming that the tours allowed reporters to tour the zone and prepare ""materials for anti-north smear campaigns."" A  statement issued by Pyongyang said those these actions were in violation of the armistice, which brought at ended to the hostilities in the 1950-1953 war.  The statement also warned that the United States would be held responsible for any negative fallout saying: ""If the U.S. and the South Korean authorities persist in their wrong acts to misuse the DMZ for the inter-Korean confrontation despite our warnings, these will entail unpredictable incidents including the loss of human lives in this area for which the U.S. side will be wholly to blame."" Analysts have suggested that this may be another circuitous attempt by North Korea to draw the United States into direct negotiations and press for a treaty officially ending the war.  North Korea earlier suggested that no progress could be made on the denuclearization issue without such a treaty being forged.  Note that these developments came in the aftermath of the sinking of a South Korean military ship on March 27, 2010, in the conflict ridden waters of the border zone.  Both South Korea and the United States said they did not believe that North Korea was involved in that incident. In April 2010, investigations into the sinking of  that South Korean warship near the North Korean border cast new suspicions on Pyongyang's possible involvement, although Seoul was careful not to expressly place the blame in that direction.  Initial reports indicated that the underwater explosion was caused by a torpedo.  South Korean Defense Minister Tae-young said that a close range external explosion appeared to have destroyed  the vessel.  In an interview with the media, the South Korean cabinet minister said, ""Basically, I think the bubble jet effect caused by a heavy torpedo is the most likely cause.""  Kim was careful to refrain from speculating about who might be behind the firing of a torpedo and said that the investigation still had to be completed.  South Korea confirmed in the third week of May 2010 that North Korea was behind the March 2010 incident in which one of its warships located in the conflict ridden waters of the border zone was destroyed. South Korean investigators earlier said that a torpedo hit the ship, killing 46 people. Despite knowing the cause of the sinking of the warship, South Korea had been circumspect in ascribing blame. Now, however, South Korea was asserting that its neighbor to the north was behind the mysterious incident. Clearly, South Korea's confidence in naming North Korea as the responsible party would change the geopolitical landscape.

North Korea immediately responded by denying any such role, promising dire consequences, and warning that war was inevitable if South Korea sought retribution. Pyongyang promised to cease any cooperation with Seoul and warned that it would abrogate the North-South non-aggression pact, if Seoul moved to retaliate. Moreover, Pyongyang issued a statement noting that ""a war may break out right now"" and that it ""will regard the present situation as the phase of a war and decisively handle all matters arising in inter-Korean relations to cope with it.""

For his part, South Korean Prime Minister Lee Myung-bak described the sinking incident as a ""surprise military attack from North Korea [that came] while South Korean people were resting late at night."" Prime Minister Lee also said his country would indeed take ""resolute countermeasures"" against the North over the sinking of the war ship. Given Seoul's position that its response would be ""prudent,"" and the vulnerability of the South Korean people in terms of proximity, it was unlikely that the response would involve military retaliation.

During a formal address on the matter, President Lee said his country would take the matter up at the United Nations Security Council. He also announced the suspension of inter-Korean exchanges and said that North Korean ships would be banned from passing through South Korean waters. Explaining the rationale behind these measures, President Lee said, ""We have always tolerated North Korea's brutality, time and again. We did so because we have always had a genuine longing for peace on the Korean peninsula."" He continued, ""But now things are different. North Korea will pay a price corresponding to its provocative acts.""

In response to South Korea's moves, North Korea severed all ties with its neighbor, including communications links and the passage of ships and aircraft from territorial waters and airspace respectively. According to Pyongyang's official news agency, North Korea also intended to expel all South Korean workers at a factory to the north of the border, which has jointly-administered. Indeed, a statement publicized via the official news agency read as follows: ""The Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea... formally declares that from now on it will put into force the resolute measures to totally freeze the inter-Korean relations, totally abrogate the agreement on non-aggression between the North and the South and completely halt the inter-Korean cooperation,""

These developments did not bode well for the process of reconciliation between the two Koreas. Still, Seoul seemed intent on winning the public relations war across the border. To this end, there were plans to send propaganda leaflets and flash electronic billboard messages to North Korea, explaining the sinking of the warship. As well, there were plans for the resumption of propaganda broadcasts to North Korea for the same reason.

Earlier, United States Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, en route to Asia, made clear that North Korea would have to face consequences for its apparent intemperate actions. On the diplomatic front once in Asia, United States Secretary of State Clinton enjoyed little progress in drawing China into the equation to place pressure on North Korea. The United States, which firmly backed South Korea, was hoping for a joint response to the act of provocation from North Korea. However, China offered only a call for all sides to demonstrate restraint. That said, in a measure presumably intended to demonstrate solidarity and inflict some degree of intimidation, the United States announced it would conduct joint anti-submarine naval exercises with South Korean forces. By the first week of June 2010, South Korea had referred North Korea to the United Nations over the matter of the torpedoed warship.  While South Korea seemed intent on forcing North Korea to face consequences for its actions, it was not seeking a particular action by the international body. Instead, South Korean President Lee Myung-Bak said during a speech in Singapore that ""North Korea must admit its wrongdoing.""  Speculation abounded that with China, which wields a veto on the United Nations Security Council, unlikely to support the notion of sanctions against North Korea, South Korea was likely to be seeking some other form of international rebuke against the North. For its part, North Korea dispatched a letter to the United Nations Security Council rejecting claims it sank the South Korean warship.  North Korea also warned the international body to refrain from debating the issue, saying that it should instead facilitate Pyongyang's own internal inquiry into the incident. In late October 2010, North Korean and South Korean troops exchanged fire across the border. According to accounts from authorities in Seoul, North Korean troops fired two rounds in the direction of a front line unit at Hwacheon, prompting South Korean troops to return fire. No further exchange of fire followed the incident and there were no injuries to South Korean troops. There was no consensus as to whether or not North Korea's actions constituted a direct provocation.  Only days later on November 3, 2010, South Korea's navy fired warning shots at a North Korean fishing vessel in  maritime border waters. In the last week of November 2010, an exchange of fire occurred between North Korean and South Korean forces, leaving two South Korean marines dead, 16 other South Korean marines injured, and three civilians wounded.  At issue was the shelling of the inhabited Yeonpyeong Island by North Korea, located in close proximity the disputed  Yellow Sea maritime border, just off the North Korean coast.  South Korea, whose military was conducting military exercises in the waters off Yeonpyeong Island, reportedly  returned fire, spurring one of the most serious clashes between the North and the South since the Korean War.  Some fifty shells reportedly landed on the island, largely hitting a South Korean military base in the area.  South Korea returned a fire with about 80 shells; the casualties on the north side of the border were not known.

South Korean President Lee Myung-bak convened  a meeting of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the capital city of Seoul.  Following the meeting, he announced that the South Korean military would punish North Korea for its attack, adding that it was vital that Pyongyang not engage in further provocation.

For its part, Pyongyang placed the blame on South Korea for igniting the clashes. It should be noted that Seoul disputes the North Korean version of the events that transpired. Nevertheless, according to the state-run KCNA news agency, ""The South Korean enemy, despite our repeated warnings, committed reckless military provocations of firing artillery shells into our maritime territory near Yeonpyeong Island.""  The North, therefore, was prepared to strike back if South Korea ""dares to invade our sea territory.""

United States President Barack Obama characterized the incident an ""outrageous, provocative act"" by North Korea. Russia struck a similar tone with Russian  Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warning of a ""colossal danger""  and characterizing those responsible for the clashes as carrying a huge responsibility.  The European Union also added its voice to the litany of condemnations. Japanese Prime Minister, Naoto Kan, took a defensive stance in the national interests of his country, saying that his government had to prepare for the occurrence of ""any unexpected event.""

But China, North Korea's closest ally, offered a murky suggestion that the two Koreas should ""do more to contribute to peace.""  A spokesperson for the Chinese government also called for restarting  six-party negotiations on North Korea's nuclear program -- a prospect that seemed practically unlikely, given these latest developments.  Indeed, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency, President Lee Myung-bak was reported to have informed a visiting Chinese foreign policy adviser, Dai Bingguo, that his country (South Korea) was not interested in the resumption of the multilateral nuclear talks; the South Korean leader apparently emphasized the importance of immediately dealing with North Korea's aggressive actions of late.

In another development, South Korean Defense Minister Kim Tae-young came under fire for ignoring intelligence reports that alerted his country of possible attacks from the North, as well as the country's slow and weak responses to the threat posed by Pyongyang.  Perhaps not surprisingly, he was forced to resign from his post.

To date, there have been occasional flare ups in the border regions since the Korean War ended without a  peace treaty in 1953.  However, the attack on Yeonpyeong Island  occurred at a time of increased tensions between the two Koreas. Months earlier in March 2010, as discussed above, South Korea accused North Korea of torpedoing one of its warships  in the area of the western maritime border, also known as the Northern Limit Line. For its part, North Korea has denied that charge and has also insisted that South Korea engage in diplomatic talks with Pyongyang aimed at easing tensions, or, deal with ""catastrophic"" consequences. Then, in late October 2010, as discussed above, North Korean and South Korean troops exchanged fire across the border. According to accounts from authorities in Seoul, North Korean troops fired two rounds in the direction of a front line unit at Hwacheon, prompting South Korean troops to return fire. No further exchange of fire followed the incident and there were no injuries to South Korean troops. There was no consensus as to whether or not North Korea's actions constituted a direct provocation. Only days later on November 3, 2010, South Korea's navy fired warning shots at a North Korean fishing vessel in maritime border waters.

At the time, South Korea  sought to downplay the incidences or the prospects of trouble emanating from the North. Indeed, during a news conference focused on an impending summit in Seoul, South Korean President Lee Myung-bak had said, ""I don't think the North will try to do anything when leaders of the international community are meeting to discuss the world economy."" He continued, ""I trust the North won't do anything but still we are fully prepared.""

On the other side of the border, while North Korea has a history of making provocative moves, many analysts said that it was unlikely that Pyongyang would seek to alienate the international community, especially at a time when it has been revealing its new leadership succession team to the world. Earlier, President Kim Jong-il's son was given a military promotion, and sanctioned as the likely successor to the ailing leader. Of course, as illustrated by the events in late November 2010 on Yeonpyeong Island, it was apparent that the path of provocation was the one being traversed by North Korea.

Attention was on the matter of why North Korea would seek to heighten the state of volatility on the Korean Peninsula.  Perhaps, for North Korea, this is a simple matter of defending its interests.  However, it could well be that the aforementioned analysts interpreted the matter of leadership transition incorrectly.  It could well be that North Korea is not concerned with the matter of alienating the international community. Instead, at this time of leadership transition from ailing President Kim Jong-il to his son, the priority from Pyongyang is to establish North Korea's power, and to show the military elite in North Korea that the named successor is not afraid to embrace a muscular stance in relation to the South, and indeed, the world.

The situation on the Korean peninsula has been made more complicated by the November 2010 revelation that North Korea constructed a  new nuclear facility. A nuclear scientist from Stanford University in the United States, Dr. Siegfried Hecker, said that during a visit to North Korea, he was shown a new nuclear facility.  There -- at the new nuclear facility at the Yongbyon nuclear complex to the north of the capital of Pyongyang -- he viewed ""more than 1,000 centrifuges"" for enriching uranium -- elements needed for the production of nuclear weapons.

Since  the nuclear facility did not exist when international nuclear weapons inspectors were expelled from North Korea in 2009, it was clear that it had been constructed quickly.  But Dr. Hecker noted that the facility boasted a high level of sophistication, and as reported in the New York Times, it included an ""ultra-modern control room.""  According to Dr. Hecker, the facility appeared oriented for the use of civilian nuclear power.  Noting that there was no sign of plutonium production, which is needed for weapons proliferation, Dr. Hecker nonetheless cautioned in an interview with the Associated Press that the new facility could be ""readily converted to produce highly enriched uranium bomb fuel.""

Dr. Hecker additionally  shored up previous reports that North Korea has been constructing a light-water nuclear  reactor.  His observations on the ground in North Korea appeared to coincide with satellite imagery depicting the construction of the reactor at Yongbyon.  Typically, light-water reactors are associated with civilian energy usage, however, uranium  enrichment is part of the process, it was not inconceivable that further enrichment could potentially ensue at weapons-grade levels.

To date, North Korea is believed to have sufficient weaponized plutonium for about six atomic bombs, although there has been little evidence to suggest that the country has actively pursued a weapons program.  That being said, Western powers have been advocating a resumption of the stalled six-party talks dealing with North Korea's nuclear program.In November 2010, a senior United States Department of State envoy, Stephen Bosworth, was in Asia on a trip aimed at reviving the multilateral negotiations. However, this latest act of provocation by North Korea on Yeonpyeong Island left the United States with no choice but to disengage from the multilateral diplomatic process, essentially ruling out the resumption of six-party talks on North Korea's nuclear disarmament for the foreseeable future.

On Nov. 23, 2010, in an interview with ABC News, United States President Barack Obama characterized North Korea's shelling of Yeonpyeong Island as ""a serious and ongoing threat that needs to be dealt with. President Obama also reaffirmed his country's alliance with South Korea, describing that country as an important ally. He said, ""We strongly affirm our commitment to defend South Korea as part of that alliance."" The United States president also noted, ""We want to make sure all the parties in the region recognize that this is a serious and ongoing threat that needs to be dealt with."" This statement appeared to target China, as he continued saying that Pyongyang needs to know ""that there are a set of international rules they need to abide by.""

By the close of November 2010, tensions on the Korean peninsula remained high, as South Korea and the United States carried out joint military exercises in the Yellow Sea, to the south of the disputed maritime border. North Korea said it viewed the previously -arranged military exercises as a provocation and warned of retaliation if there was any violation of its territorial waters. A statement from Pyongyang broadcast by the state-controlled KCNA news agency read as follows: ""We will deliver a brutal military blow on any provocation which violates our territorial waters.""

At the start of December 2010, South Korea took a highly assertive position. The South Korean defense minister-designate, Kim Kwan-jin, warned that North Korea would face a harsh response, including air strikes, if it dared to act aggressively in the future. Kim Kwan-jin's remarks were made in parliament as he answered questions during his confirmation hearing. In response to the question of how he would react to another violent action by North Korea, Kim Kwan-jin said, ""If North Korea provokes again, we will definitely use aircraft to attack North Korea."" Clearly, this posture by South Korea was a marked departure from its long-held restraint in the face of North Korea's provocations. Making clear that it intended to maintain this assertive posture, South Korea also said that it was going to carry out military drills from the aforementioned Yeonpyeong Island, even though North Korea has condemned those plans and warned that it would retaliate with force. With Pyongyang and Seoul at odds with one another in such a marked fashion, there were heightened anxieties about the renewal of war on the Korean peninsula.

Yet even with those fears at hand, the landscape became even more complicated when in mid-December 2010, South Korea said that it suspected North Korea of secretly enriching uranium at locations beyond its main nuclear site at Yongbyon.  South Korean Foreign Minister Kim Sung-hwan would not confirm a media report that North Korea was home to three more plants where uranium enrichment could take place, however, he admitted to having suspicions along these lines. During a news conference, he said, ""It is a report based on what is still intelligence and let me just say that we have been following this issue for some time."" Should this claim be proved correct, North Korea could conceivably possess material -- potentially for building more nuclear bombs. Moreover, such actions would fly in the face of renewed nuclear disarmament talks, which were already on a downward slide as a result of North Korea's latest aggressive actions (as discussed above).

By the third week of December 2010, intense dissonance characterized relations on the Korean peninsula for the myriad reasons discussed above. Former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, who also served as ambassador to the United Nations, was acting as an unofficial United States envoy in the region, with an eye on reducing the level of tensions. That job, however, was not helped when United Nations meetings on the matter ended with no resolution. Nevertheless, there were signs of progress when North Korea began to reverse course, effectively moving away from its threats to take retaliatory action against South Korea for the aforementioned military drills. The shift from Pyongyang came after South Korea evacuated residents from the area on and around Yeonpyeong Island and launched fighter jets from its terrain. Analysts surmised that the strong stance from South Korea may have forced North Korea to rethink the likely consequences of making good on expressed threats. As explained by Governor Richardson, ""South Korea was able to flex its muscles, and North Korea reacted in a statesmanlike manner.""  But despite these encouraging indications, on Dec. 23, 2010, the rhetoric between the two Koreas was on the rise once again. South Korea's president was promising harsh retaliation if his country was again attacked, while  North Korean was warning of a ""sacred"" nuclear war, if provoked.

Meanwhile, Governor Richardson -- a seasoned diplomat -- who has had years of experience negotiating with the North Koreans, announced that North Korea was willing to offer concessions in regard to their nuclear program. In an interview with the Associated Press, Governor Richardson said, ""We had positive results."" He continued, ""I hope this will signal a new chapter and a round of dialogue to lessen tension on the Korean peninsula."" Given the increasing concerns about North Korea's capacity to build nuclear bombs, this development was welcomed. But, as United States Department of State spokesman, P.J. Crowley, cautioned, ""North Korea talks a great game. They always do. The real issue is what will they do. If they are agreeable to returning IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] inspectors to their country, they need to tell the IAEA that."" In a New Year's message at the close of 2010, North Korea appeared to strike a conciliatory note as it called for dialogue with South Korea. North Korea was reported to have called for ""a lasting peace system on the Korean Peninsula,"" which it said should be made ""nuclear-free through dialogue and negotiations."" Heightened tensions have marked relations between the two Koreas since the sinking of a South Korean warship by the North earlier in 2010, and reached a nadir at the close of the year, following the shelling of Yeonpyeong Island (under South Korean jurisdiction) by the North. For its part, Seoul opted to take a more aggressive stance in relation to Pyongyang since these events by carrying out military exercises in the border zones and increasing its rhetoric. Now, the call for improved relations by Pyongyang may have been interpreted as a shift in stance, aimed at lowering tensions on the Korean peninsula. However, Pyongyang's message, which was publicized via North Korean state media, went onto to warn of increased military strength. The New Year's message said that North Korea's military would ""conduct intense combat training in an atmosphere of actual battle as required by the tense situation."" On Feb. 9, 2011, bilateral talks between the two Koreas were reported to have broken down.  Delegates from North Korea and South Korea had been meeting in  the border village of Panmunjom with the intent of working through a number of sensitive cross-border issues.  There were hopes that the security talks would ease tensions between the two Koreas, which reached a nadir after the shelling of a South Korean island by North Korean forces in November 2010.  Significantly, these discussions were intended to set the foundation for further, higher-level, negotiations.  However, the disintegration of these talks meant that there was no consensus on an agenda for future meetings. In July 2011,  good news was brewing in the realm of foreign relations. The United States and North Korea completed a set of exploratory discussions, which were mutually characterized as positive.These bilateral talks were intended to be a precursor to the resumption of multilateral denuclearization  negotiations.  To that end, Ambassador Bosworth said that his country would enter consultations with  South Korea and other countries involved multilateral negotiations that have been ongoing for years, to consider how to proceed further with North Korea.

Later in August 2011, though, prospects for a return to multilateral talks were dimmed when an imbroglio ensued between North Korea and South Korea.  The situation was spurred when shells from North Korea were fired close to the maritime border with South Korea.  In response, the South Korean navy  fired warning shots towards North Korea. According to South Korean sources, artillery shells from North Korea landed in the Yellow Sea close to Yeonpyeong Island, which is under Seoul's jurisdiction.  Further rounds were fired on the same day.  Defense officials from South Korea  surmised that the initial firing of shells may have been due to training exercises by North Korea.  Nevertheless, South Korea wasted no time in responding with warning shots. It should be noted that Yeonpyeong Island was in the global purview in late 2010 when North Korea fired shells in that direction, leaving four people dead and triggering the outrage of South Korea and its allies.As the month drew to a close, tension increased when five South Koreans were arrested for spying on behalf of North Korea.  South Korean prosecutors said that the five individuals conveyed sensitive  military and political information to the North over a period of two decades.  Among the sensitive material were satellite images of major military installations, as well as field manuals of United States forces in South Korea.  All five individuals were accused by South Korean authorities of violating the country's  national security law, engaging in espionage, and communication with an enemy.It should be noted that in December 2011, North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, died leaving his son, Kim Jong-un, as the new leader of that country.  It was yet to be seen how this development would influence relations between the two Koreas.

See ""Special Report"" below as regards North Korea's provocative actions related to its nuclear program.  See ""Special Notes"" below regarding recent bilateral relations between the two Koreas.  Relations with Japan South Korea and Japan normalized relations in 1965. In the past several years, besides developing close and mutually beneficial economic relations, the bilateral relations of South Korea and Japan at the government level have improved steadily and significantly.  But in March 2005, Japan reinstated its claim on a small group of islands whose sovereignty has been under dispute.  South Korea, which has also claimed the islands, said that the move by Japan would have a damaging effect on bilateral relations.  South Korea and Japan share similar trepidation about a nuclearized North Korea. Relations with China South Korea and China established full diplomatic relations in August 1992, and since then the two countries have shed much of their Cold War enmity through economic ties. Two-way trade has expanded dramatically, to nearly $24 billion in 1999 from $6.4 billion in 1992. They are now each other's third-largest trading partners. Recently moves toward military relations began to emerge between South Korea and China. In August 1999 South Korean Defense Minister Cho Sung-tae visited China, and in January 2000 Chinese Defense Minister Chi Haotian paid a visit to South Korea. The South Korean government expects close military ties with China to help ensure peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula, believing that China is in better position than any other power to persuade North Korea to abandon its dangerous nuclear and missile brinkmanship and blackmail strategy. As for relations with Taiwan, Seoul-Taipei relations were soured when South Korea switched its diplomatic recognition to China in 1992. South Korea reiterated its stance of continuing the ""one China"" policy, saying that South Korea-Taiwan relations are confined to the economic and private sectors. Regional blocs Meanwhile, South Korea has exerted itself in developing cooperative relations with countries in the Asia-Pacific region. It is a founding member of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. It also has participated in ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) plus three summits along with Chinese and Japanese leaders to discuss economic and security issues with the ASEAN countries. Other Significant Relations Relations with the United States  A strong security relationship with the United States (U.S.) is an essential part of South Korea's foreign policy. In the 1954 U.S.-R.O.K. Mutual Defense Treaty, the United States agreed to help the Republic of Korea defend itself against external aggression. In support of this commitment, the United States currently maintains approximately 37,000 service personnel, including the Army's Second Infantry Division and several Air Force tactical squadrons. To coordinate operations between these units and the 650,000-strong Korean armed forces, a Combined Forces Command (CFC) was established in 1978. The head of the CFC also serves as commander in chief of the United Nations Command (UNC) and the U.S. Forces in Korea (USFK).

Several aspects of the security relationship have changed as the U.S. moves from a leading to a supporting role. Since 1991, South Korea and the United States have shared the cost of keeping American troops in the peninsula. South Korea also has agreed to pay a larger portion of USFK's stationing costs, and to promote changes in the CFC command structure. On Dec. 1, 1994, peacetime operational control authority over all South Korean military units still under United States operational control was transferred to the South Korean Armed Forces. Despite recent dramatic developments in the relationship between the two Koreas, South Korea still sees a close security cooperation with the United States and Japan a crucial priority in its policies on North Korea.  South Korea's close relationship with the United States, especially as regards the war in Iraq, has exacted a difficult toll at times.  Note: In late June 2008, angry South Koreans took to the streets in the capital city of Seoul  to protest the resumption of  beef imports from the United States (U.S.).  Since 2003, South Korea suspended beef imports from the U.S. after a case of ""mad cow"" disease was identified.  Now, in 2008, the ban was being lifted, effectively allowing shipments of U.S. beef to enter South Korea.  However, despite assurances that U.S. beef was safe, many South Koreans were not assuaged and decided to register their discontent in public demonstrations.  See ""Political Conditions"" for further details.   Editor's Update: In mid-July 2007, 23 South Koreans were taken hostage by the Taliban in Afghanistan while traveling from Kandahar -- a Taliban stronghold -- to the Afghan capital of Kabul on a Christian mission. It was the most significant group abduction by the Taliban since the fall of its regime in 2001. 

The Taliban said that the captives were in good health but would be killed if the Afghan government did not release several Islamic militants from prison.  The Taliban also demanded the exit of the 200 South Korean forces operating in Afghanistan. South Korean forces were already scheduled to withdraw from Afghanistan later in the year.South Korean envoys traveled to Kabul to work with the Afghan government on securing the release of the hostages.  These efforts were grounded in serious diplomacy and were aimed at ensuring that the South Koreans were released safely.  For its part, the Taliban extended its deadline for negotiations for the purpose of having their demands met.One South Korean hostage -- the group's leader, Bae Hyung-Kyu -- was reported to have killed on July 25, 2007.  By the close of July 2007, Afghan President Hamid Karzai said that his government was expending its best efforts to free the surviving 22 South Korean hostages -- most of whom were females -- held by the Taliban.  Karzai condemned their abductions as a ""shameful"" reflection of Islamic religion and Afghan culture.  There were also reports that the Afghan government was not foreclosing the use of military action to free the South Korean missionary workers.  However, the Afghan government noted that it would not participate in a prisoner exchange.  On the other side of the equation, a spokesperson for the Taliban said that a new deadline would be set for the killing of the hostages.To that end, in an interview with Agence France Presse, Yousuf Ahmadi said that if the Afghan government did not meet its demands for the release of several Islamic militants from prison, some of the South Koreans would be killed.  Indeed, on July 30, 2007, one male South Korean hostage was shot to death because the Taliban said that the government was not responding appropriately to its demands.  Pope Benedict XVI entered the political fray to excoriate the Taliban kidnappers whom he said were acting against ""the most basic rules of civilization.""  .  Editor's Note:  Foreign Policy involving new Obama Administration in the United States (as of early 2009 -2011)  Before arriving in Asia on her first overseas trip, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton warned North Korea against any ""provocative action and unhelpful rhetoric."" En route to Asia, Clinton said that North Korea had to adhere to its commitments to dismantle its nuclear programs. She said, ""The North Koreans have already agreed to dismantling...We expect them to fulfill the obligations that they entered into.""  But the United States' top diplomat was also critical of the Bush administration for abandoning the 1994 agreement with North Korea, which was forged during the presidency of Bill Clinton. The 1994 framework, which called for North Korea to give up its weapons program, collapsed when the Bush administration accused Pyongyang of maintaining a parallel (secondary) enriched uranium program. Clinton suggested that Pyongyang's decision to restart its nuclear program may have been partially due to the Bush administration's intemperate accusations of North Korea.Clinton was confronted with a significant challenge on the trip to Asia, and particularly, the Korean peninsula. Amidst devolving relations between Pyongyang and Seoul, North Korea was hinting that it was preparing to test-fire the long-range Taepodong-2 missile. Accordingly, she was tasked with taking a strong positions on, first,  the missile test, and second, on North Korea's nuclear ambitions, while also working to reinvigorate the diplomatic process in the region and improving relations between Pyongyang and Washington.To these ends, Clinton warned that relations between her country and North Korea were unlikely to improve unless Pyongyang was willing to engage in dialogue with Seoul. Clinton, who was speaking in the South Korean capital, took a sharp tone as she called on North Korea to bring an end to its nuclear ambitions, consistent with the provisions of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1718. She also characterized the notion of a missile test as ""provocative.""Nevertheless, Clinton made clear that diplomacy was the central focus of her objectives by announcing a special envoy to North Korea. Clinton named former Ambassador Stephen Bosworth, who served in South Korea from 1997 to 2000, to that role.As noted above, by the start of February 2009, it was reported that North Korea was preparing to test-fire the long-range Taepodong-2 missile. Then in  March 2009, North Korea was threatening to go to war with any entity that tried to shoot down the  satellite it intended to launch. A statement by the North Korean military read, ""We will retaliate any act of intercepting our satellite for peaceful purposes with prompt counter-strikes by the most powerful military means.""  It also included the following assertion: ""Shooting our satellite for peaceful purposes will precisely mean a war.""  In a presumed effort to augment its warning, North Korea said its military was placed on full combat alert.  This warning came  at a time when scheduled joint military exercises between South Korea and the United States were about to commence.Meanwhile, the newly-appointed United States envoy to North Korea, Stephen Bosworth, who was in Asia to revitalize six-party denuclearization talks, noted that a launch by North Korea would be ""ill advised.""By the spring of 2009, North Korea's  attempt to launch a satellite into orbit resulted in an international outcry. Throughout, the United States and South Korea have said that North Korea's claim of launching a satellite in space was just a cover for an actual missile test of the Taepodong-2. Accordingly, they have urged the United Nations Security Council to issue a strong response. The United States, South Korea and Japan regard the launch to be an abrogation of United Nations Security Resolution 1718, which in 2006 banned North Korea from ballistic missile activity.North Korea's  announcement that it was withdrawing from multilateral disarmament talks and restarting its operations at the Yongbyon nuclear plant -- made in the spring of 2009 -- was not expected to improve the foreign relations climate.Then, on May 25, 2009, North Korea said that it had successfully conducted an underground nuclear test.  Several independent entities confirmed that a powerful explosion had been registered,  resulting in the conclusion that it was caused by the nuclear test.  As noted above, condemnation from the international community -- including the United States, as expected, as well as Russia and China -- followed this action.  As well, the United Nations issued its own scathing rebuke and warned that a new resolution was in the works.Meanwhile, United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Susan Rice, also said that the formulation of a new resolution with more stringent measures would commence right away.  Rice said, ""The US thinks that this is a grave violation of international law and a threat to regional and international peace and security. And therefore the United States will seek a strong resolution with strong measures.""As noted above, on May 27, 2009,  North Korea announced its withdrawal from the armistice that ended the Korean War and restarted its nuclear operations at Yongbyon.Also as noted above, by early 2010, North Korea indicated that part of the new phase of negotiations on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula should include a new peace treaty to replace the armistice that ended the Korean War.  North Korea said that a peace agreement should form the fulcrum of  negotiations on this matter and should be addressed prior to the return to six-party talks aimed at ending Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program, or, as a central part of those multilateral negotiations.As noted above in May 2010, the United States expressed support for the measures taken by South Korea in response to the sinking of a warship by North Korea.As noted above, by the close of 2010, the United States was stepping away from possible multilateral negotiations with North Korea following a spate of aggression by the North towards the South. See above for details.

In July 2011, some good news was brewing in the realm of foreign relations. The United States and North Korea completed a set of exploratory discussions, which North Korea's envoy, Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye Gwan, characterized as positive.  Speaking of his meetings with United States Ambassador Stephen Bosworth, the Obama administration's leading representative on North Korean affairs, Kim Kye Gwan said, ""Yesterday and today we discussed comprehensively, with Mr. Bosworth, matters of mutual interest. The talks were very constructive and businesslike and we continue to maintain contacts.""  For his part, Ambassador Bosworth said, ""These discussions are designed to explore the willingness of North Korea to take concrete and irreversible steps toward denuclearization."" These bilateral talks were intended to be a precursor to the resumption of multilateral denuclearization  negotiations.  To that end, Ambassador Bosworth said that his country would enter consultations with  South Korea and other countries involved multilateral negotiations that have been ongoing for years, to consider how to proceed further with North Korea.

Later in August 2011, though, prospects for a return to multilateral talks were dimmed when an imbroglio ensued between North Korea and South Korea, as discussed above.  The situation was spurred when shells from North Korea were fired close to the maritime border with South Korea.  In response, the South Korean navy  fired warning shots towards North Korea. According to South Korean sources, artillery shells from North Korea landed in the Yellow Sea close to Yeonpyeong Island, which is under Seoul's jurisdiction.  Further rounds were fired on the same day.  Defense officials from South Korea  surmised that the initial firing of shells may have been due to training exercises by North Korea.  Nevertheless, South Korea wasted no time in responding with warning shots. It should be noted that Yeonpyeong Island was in the global purview in late 2010 when North Korea fired shells in that direction, leaving four people dead and triggering the outrage of South Korea and its allies.   

As the month drew to a close, tension increased when five South Koreans were arrested for spying on behalf of North Korea.  South Korean prosecutors said that the five individuals conveyed sensistive  military and political information to the North over a period of two decades.  Among the sensitive material were satellite images of major military installations, as well as field manuals of United States forces in South Korea.  All five individuals were accused by South Korean authorities of violating the country's  national security law, engaging in espionage, and communication with an enemy.It should be noted that in December 2011, North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, died leaving his son, Kim Jong-un, as the new leader of that country.  It was yet to be seen how this development would influence relations between the two Koreas.Special ReportIn April  2012, attention was on North Korea's  plan to launch a satellite into orbit.  Pyongyang announced a month prior that it would launch an ""earth observation"" satellite, or the Kwangmyongsong-3, using a long-range rocket.  The event was intended  to mark the 100th birthday of its late leader Kim Il-Sung.  Of course, such a move would be contrary to the prevailing United Nations resolutions, which prohibits North Korea's use of long-range intercontinental ballistic missile technology,  as well as the aforementioned ""denuclearization for food"" agreement, the latter of which requires North Korea to adhere to a moratorium on nuclear tests and long-range missile launches.

Not surprisingly, all the other countries involved in multilateral negotiations -- South Korea, Japan, China, Russia, and the United States -- expressed dismay over this plan by North Korea. Victoria Nuland of the United States Department of State pointed to the concurrence and urged North Korea to rethink the satellite launch saying, ""Obviously, we were heartened that every single one of the six-party talks participants made clear that they think that this would be an extremely bad idea and a violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions, so we are hoping and expecting that the DPRK will take that to heart.""  The United States also noted it would be ""very hard"" to go forward with its planned food assistance if North Korea moved ahead with the plan to launch a satellite into orbit.

The geopolitical complexity of the Korean peninsula became more complicated when the White House in the United States announced that President Barack Obama intended to visit the world's most heavily militarized border -- the  Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ).  The White House explained that the trip to the DMZ was intended  to convey the president's support  for the 30,000 United States troops stationed in South Korea, and to augment bilateral relations between Washington and Seoul.  In a press briefing, Daniel Russel, Asia director for the White House National Security Council, said: ""The DMZ is the front line of democracy in the Korean Peninsula, and it's the symbol of the U.S. and [South Korean] resolve, as well as solidarity. So a visit by the president there to see and to thank the U.S. and the South Korean service members makes perfect sense.""

After his visit to the DMZ, President Obama was set to attend a global summit  aimed at reducing the risk of nuclear terrorism in the South Korean capital of Seoul. In addition to the controversial and difficult issues of nuclear development in Iran and North Korea, the summit also addressed the threats posed by nuclear terrorists, as well as radiological materials that could be used to construct a ""dirty bomb"" (i.e. a bomb that would spread radiological contamination rather than causing a nuclear explosion).  Also on the agenda was a plan for nuclear power stations to convert to low-enriched fuel.  Due to the complexity of  these issues, it was  unlikely that new agreements and concurrence would be found anytime soon despite the participation of 50 countries at the Nuclear Security Summit.  Notably absent from the list of participants  at the summit were North Korea and Iran.

During his trip to Asia for the Nuclear Security Summit, President Obama  reiterated his call for  ""a world without nuclear weapons"" and advanced his foreign policy agenda that advocates  non-proliferation and the reduction of  nuclear weapons through increase diplomacy.

In a speech to students at South Korea's Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, President Obama said the United States -- the only nation to have ever used nuclear weapons -- was fully committed to  reducing its stockpile of nuclear arms.  The United States leader said his country had a""moral obligation"" to pursue strategic arms cuts.  President Obama also drew thunderous applause from the audience of students when he said that, as a father, he did not wish to see his daughters growing up in a world with nuclear threats.

""I say this as president of the only nation ever to use nuclear weapons,"" Obama said. ""I say it as a commander in chief who knows that our nuclear codes are never far from my side. Most of all, I say it as a father, who wants my two young daughters to grow up in a world where everything they know and love can't be instantly wiped out.""

President Obama acknowledged his country's unique position in the world but noted that ""serious sustained global effort"" was needed to achieve his expressed hope for a nuclear weapons-free world. Addressing the matter of North Korea's nuclear ambitions, President Obama made clear that the United States held ""no hostile intent"" to that country, but warned there would be ""no rewards for provocation.""

President Obama went on say:  ""The United States has no hostile intent toward your country...We are committed to peace. And we are prepared to take steps to improve relations, which is why we have offered nutritional aid to North Korean mothers and children.""  President Obama continued, ""But by now it should be clear, your provocations and pursuit of nuclear weapons have not achieved the security you seek -- they have undermined it. Instead of the dignity you desire, you're more isolated. Instead of earning the respect of the world, you've been met with strong sanctions and condemnation. You can continue down the road you are on, but we know where that leads. It leads to more of the same -- more broken dreams, more isolation, ever more distance between the people of North Korea and the dignity and the opportunity that they deserve.""

Meanwhile, in his speech at the nuclear summit, President Obama reiterated the warning already issued by his government that the long-range missile launch to place a satellite in orbit would only result in isolation for Pyongyang.He said,  ""With respect to North Korea, we are going to be both sending messages to North Korea that they should not go forward with this missile launch, which would violate existing U.N. Security Council resolutions. And our hope is, is that we can resolve these issues diplomatically.""

President Obama also joined South Korean President Lee Myung-bak in noting that North Korea would be subject to further sanctions if it did not cancel its launch plans. Making clear the options available for North Korea, President Obama addressed the leadership of that country saying, ""You can continue with the road you are on but we know where that leads...Today, we say: Pyongyang, have the courage to pursue peace.""

For his part,  Kim Jong Un -- North Korea's new leader -- appeared to be following his father's footsteps in the realm of rhetoric as he deemed the  nuclear summit to be  ""a childish farce.""  Earlier, Pyongyang asserted that  denunciations of North Korea  would amount to a ""declaration of war.""

Pyongyang was also signaling that it had no intention of pulling back from its missile launch to sent a satellite into orbit. Instead,  South Korean sources were reporting that North Korea  moved a long-range rocket to a launch pad close to the Chinese border.  As well, satellite imagery appeared to depict preparations for the launch, which Pyongyang had said would take place between April 12-16, 2012.  The guidance was that the rocket would follow a  trajectory that would take it close to south-western Japan.

Accordingly, Japan's defense ministry made it clear that it had ordered the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) to intercept North Korea's rocket launch, if necessary, using its missile shield.  Japanese authorities also alerted rescue personnel that they would be mobilized to deal with potential disasters, should the  veer off course. Already, the South Korean government had said that it would  shoot down any North Korean rocket that strayed into its territory. As well, the United States was sea-based X-band radar into the Pacific to monitor the launch. Upset about the prospect of rocket debris affecting countries of the Pacific, President Benigno Aquino III of the Philippines called on Pyongyang to abandon the launch plans.

It should be noted that the Obama administration in the United States canceled its food aid program to North Korea due to that country's decision to move forward with the satellite launch.  An official from the Pentagon was cited as saying: ""Why we're not providing that food assistance at this point is because our confidence in their ability to meet their agreements has been diminished. We do not use it as a lever to change their policies.""

A week ahead of the timeline expected for the North Korean missile launch, President Kim Jong Un warned that any country that dared to interfere with its plans  would face ""immediate, resolute and merciless punishment.""  In a statement published by  the Korean Central News Agency, the North Korean leader asserted: ""(Any country that) intercepts the satellite or collects its debris will meet immediate, resolute and merciless punishment.""  Pyongyang also warned South Korea against intercepting the rocket booster, should it stray into South Korean territorial waters.  Pyongyang promised that an interception by Seoul would bring about ""the end of everything in South Korea.""

On April 10, 2012, the United States was reiterating its warnings to North Korea that the launch of a new missile would be ""a clear and serious violation"" of international agreements.  White House press secretary Jay Carney said in an interview with journalists: ""The proposed missile launch, if conducted, would represent a clear and serious violation of North Korea's obligations under two United Nations Security Council resolutions that explicitly prohibit North Korea from testing ballistic missiles.""  Carney said the United States intended to work allied countries on implementing consequences for North Korea, should it proceed with its provocative missile launch; Carney noted that United States food aid to North Korea could be cut off.

By April 13, 2012, news emerged from North Korea that although that country attempted to launch its satellite into space, the long-range rocket failed to reach orbit.  Despite the spectacular failure of the mission, the attempted action was nonetheless widely condemned by the international community.  Notably, members of the Group of Eight industrial nation states issued a joint condemnation, noting that the launch was in clear violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions prohibiting intercontinental missile deployments.

In a related development, South Korean officials were noting that new satellite imagery suggests that North Korea was preparing to carry out a nuclear test. The imagery depicted piles of earth and sand at the entrance of a tunnel at a nuclear site, where previous nuclear bomb testing was carried out in 2006 and 2009.  An anonymous source was quoted by Agence France Presse as saying: ""Recent satellite images led us to conclude the North has been secretly digging a new underground tunnel in the nuclear test site... besides two others where the previous tests were conducted.""  Given the aforementioned launch failure, there were some suggestions that North Korea might try to ""save face"" by moving forward with an even more provocative act -- quite possibly, a nuclear test.  Of course, such an act would be regarded as a clear move down the path of confrontation by North Korea's regional neighbors as well as Western powers.

By the third week of April 2012, presumably as a cautionary move, South Korea  announced that it had deployed missiles with a range of 625 miles. The weapons would be able to strike nuclear targets inside North Korea.

As April 2012 entered its final week, North Korea was ratcheting up the militaristic rhetoric as it threatened to  initiate military action against South Korean targets and characterized South Korean President Lee Myung-bak a ""traitor"" and ""scum."" In a statement, Pyongyang issued the following threat: ""The special actions of our revolutionary armed forces will start soon to meet the reckless challenge of the group of traitors.  Once the … special actions kick off, they will reduce all the rat-like groups and the bases for provocations to ashes in 3 or 4 minutes ... by unprecedented peculiar means and methods of our own style.""

Meanwhile, reports suggested that North Korea was close to completing preparations for a  nuclear test. This move -- if successful -- would constitute North Korea's third nuclear test after two in 2006 and 2009. The global community was watching events unfold in North Korea closely as  Pyongyang may now have the capacity to conduct a test using highly enriched uranium for the very first time.  This development would presage North Korea's possible ability to  significantly build up its stocks of weapons-grade nuclear material.  As well, it would facilitate the manufacture of a nuclear warhead to mount on a long-range missile.  Should North Korea go forward with its third nuclear test, it would be a clear example of the limits of China's influence on the paranoid  regime ruling North Korea today.

At the start of 2013,  the United Nations tightened sanctions against North Korea.  This move was made in response to North Korea's December 2012 rocket launch.  For its part, North Korea reacted with anger and promised strong retaliation.  All expectations were that another nuclear test might be in the offing, although North Korea was raising the anxiety of the international community by raising the rhetoric and threatening an even harsher actions. North Korea  warned of retribution against the United States, which it described as a ""sworn enemy.""  The following statement was issued via the official Korean Central News Agency: ""We do not hide that a variety of satellites and long-range rockets will be launched and a nuclear test of higher level will be carried out in the upcoming new phase of the anti-U.S. struggle, targeting against the U.S., the sworn enemy of the Korean people.""  Pyongyang soon expanded its threats to noted that it would take action against South Korea, if it participated in the United Nations sanctions regime.  China's  official Xinhua News Agency  was also reporting that Pyongyang intended to walk away from multilateral six-part talks since ""the U.N. Security Council has been reduced into an organization bereft of impartiality and balance.""

On Feb. 12, 2013, seismic activity in North Korea suggested that North Korea may have selected an even earlier date to go forward with its third nuclear test.  The seismic shock activity was emanating from the same area where North Korea conducted its 2006 and 2009 nuclear tests. Kim Min-seok of the South Korean Defense Ministry indicated that country's belief, saying, ""We believe that North Korea has conducted a nuclear test.""  Meanwhile, the United States Geological Survey indirectly confirmed that the test had taken place as it noted the shock appeared to be one kilometer underground and was consistent with a nuclear blast.  According to Lassina Zerbo, the director of the international data center of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test Ban Treaty Organization, the magnitude of the test was twice as large as the 2009 nuclear test.  It should be noted that initial reports suggested the use of  plutonium in this nuclear test, which tends to be suited for use as a missile warhead. North Korea itself soon confirmed that it had carried out  its third underground nuclear test, which it said involved a ""miniaturized"" nuclear device. As reported in a statement by the state-run  KCNA news agency: ""It was confirmed that the nuclear test that was carried out at a high level in a safe and perfect manner using a miniaturized and lighter nuclear device with greater explosive force than previously did not pose any negative impact on the surrounding ecological environment."" North Korea claimed its third nuclear test  was an act of self-defense against ""U.S. hostility"" and warned that further  moves might be in the offing.  Via the state-controlled KCNA news agency, Pyongyang claimed  that the nuclear test  ""was only the first response"" taken ""with maximum restraint.""  Pyongyang warned that further actions were in the offing, saying: ""If the United States continues to come out with hostility and complicates the situation, we will be forced to take stronger, second and third responses in consecutive steps."" The chorus of condemnation from the international community was broad and vociferous. United Nations  Secretary General Ban Ki-moon wasted no time in condemning North Korea's nuclear test, which he emphasized was a ""clear and grave violation"" of United Nations resolutions. NATO cast the nuclear test as an ""irresponsible act"" that posed a serious threat to world peace.China, North Korea's closest ally, demanded an audience with the North Korean ambassador in Beijing, while Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi said China was ""strongly dissatisfied and resolutely opposed"" to the nuclear test.In a statement, United States President Barack Obama argued for a swift response, asserting: ""The danger posed by North Korea's threatening activities warrants further swift and credible action by the international community. The United States will also continue to take steps necessary to defend ourselves and our allies.""  The United Nations Security Council convened an emergency meeting later on Feb. 12, 2013, to discuss future measures. During that meeting, the permanent and rotating member nations of the United Nations Security Council  unanimously condemned North Korea's latest nuclear test and warned that ""appropriate measures"" would be in the offing.  Clearly, North Korea would be faced with the prospects of international action.  Even its closest ally, China, via its state-controlled media, urged North Korea not to go forward with such a provocative action  and warned that North Korea would pay a ""heavy price""  if it proceeded with the test.  Of course, in the realm of international jurisprudence, heavy costs have come in the form of harsh sanctions by the United Nations Security Council, which have done little to curtail North Korea from going forward with its missile  program and nuclear development agenda.  Indeed, the very existence of sanctions have not stopped North Korea from repeatedly violating the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.

With news circulating in the first week of March 2013  that a draft  of a United Nations Security Council resolution against North Korea had been crafted, Pyongyang wasted little time in registering its anger.  On March 5, 2013, North Korea warned that it would end its 1953 armistice (ceasefire) that brought a conclusion to the conflict with South Korea, without officially ending the Korean War.  North Korea also demanded that the United States and South Korea end its ongoing military drills in the region, referring to them as a ""dangerous nuclear war targeted at us.""  Furthermore, the Korean People's Army warned that it would carry out stronger actions  in response to the ""hostile"" policies of the United States and South Korea. It was apparent that North Korea was prepared to take an aggressive stance in the face of international pressure. On March 7, 2013, the United Nations Security Council unanimous adopted Resolution 2094 censuring North Korea for its February  nuclear test and imposing an even stricter sanctions regime on that country.   Included in those new sanctions were provisions to target the financing sources of North Korea's nuclear and missile technology, but there were additional penalties imposed on North Korea in the realm of banking, travel, transportation,  and trade. As stated by United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Susan Rice, ""The strength, breadth and severity of these sanctions will raise the cost to North Korea of its illicit nuclear program. Taken together, these sanctions will bite and bite hard.""  South Korea's Ambassador to the United Nations, Kim Sook, said the time had come for North Korea to ""wake up from its delusion"" of becoming a nuclear state. He continued, ""It can either take the right path toward a bright future and prosperity, or it can take a bad road toward further and deeper isolation and eventual self-destruction.""  Meanwhile,  United Nations  Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the unanimous adoption of the resolution delivered a strong message to North Korea that its pursuit of nuclear weapons would not be tolerated by the international community. 

In  addition to scrapping its non-aggression agreements with South Korea, North Korea responded to the news of international action by saying that it would be  cutting off the North-South hot-line. Installed in 1971, the hot-line was created to provide direct communication at  times of increased tensions and also to organize the transfer of persons and goods through the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone.  Clearly, the disabling of the hot-line was not only symbolic of the breakdown in bilateral relations between the two Koreas, there were also practical and security implications.  It should be noted that North Korea has also shockingly threatened to  launch pre-emptive nuclear attacks on the United States and South Korea in response to the joint military drills, which it said were proof of the United States' intent to go to war.  A belligerent North Korea said via its Foreign Ministry that the United Nations' action would ""compel"" that country to take ""countermeasures"" in short order.Furthermore, it declared in a statement: ""Now that the U.S. is set to light a fuse for a nuclear war, the revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK will exercise the right to a pre-emptive nuclear attack to destroy the strongholds of the aggressors and to defend the supreme interests of the country."" North Korea even threatened to transformWashington and Seoul into ""a sea in flames"" with ""lighter and smaller nukes.""  For its part, South Korea was undeterred and moving forward with the very joint military drills (with the United States) that earned outrage and threats from Pyongyang. Still, South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se said on March 11, 2013, that his country would try to re-engage with North Korea with an eye on shifting the climate from tension and threats to cooperation. In an address, Yun said his goal was to ""turn this era of confrontation and mistrust into an era of trust and cooperation with North Korea.""  Yun further asserted: ""The security situation on the Korean Peninsula for now is very grave as the unpredictability surrounding North Korea is rising following its third nuclear test.""  As March 2013 was drawing to a close, North Korea increased its belligerent rhetoric and said that missile and artillery units were combat-ready and aimed at United States and South Korean targets.  In a statement broadcast on the  state-controlled Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), the Korean People's Army's Supreme Command said: ""From this moment, the Supreme Command puts all of its field artillery including strategic rocket units and long-range artillery units into the No. 1 combat ready  posture.""  The statement further delineated targets in South Korea and the United States -- from its military installations in the Pacific to Hawaii and the mainland.  Indeed, a North Korean spokesperson was on the record saying, ""The U.S. should not forget that the Anderson Air Force Base on Guam, where B-52s take off, and naval bases in Japan proper and Okinawa, where nuclear-powered submarines are launched, are within the striking range of [North Korea's] precision strike means.""  North Korea said that its motivation was driven by the priority ""to safeguard our sovereignty and the highest dignity [of leader Kim Jong Un] through military actions.""  The United States responded with its own statement as follows: ""North Korea's bellicose rhetoric and threats follow a pattern designed to raise tensions and intimidate others. While the United Nations Command, Combined Forces Command and U.S. Forces Korea continue to maintain the armistice, North Korea continues its provocative behavior and rhetoric. The Republic of Korea-U.S. alliance is strong and we remain committed to the defense of [South Korea].""Then, on March 30, 2013, North Korea declared it was in a ""state of war"" with South Korea nd that its the long-standing truce with the South had ended.  A statement from Pyongyang read as follows: ""From this time on, the North-South relations will be entering the state of war and all issues raised between the North and South will be handled accordingly. The long-standing situation of the Korean peninsula being neither at peace nor at war is finally over.""In response, the South Korean defense ministry denounced the war threat and issued its own statement, which read as follows: ""Our military is maintaining full preparedness to leave no blind point in safeguarding the lives and safety of the people.""  As well, South Korean President Park Geun-hye noted that her country was taking the  threats from North Korea ""very seriously.""  She said, ""If there is any provocation against South Korea and its people, there should be a strong response in initial combat without any political considerations.""For its part, the United States military command in South Korea dispatched a statement that read as follows:  ""North Korea will achieve nothing by threats or provocations, which will only further isolate North Korea and undermine international efforts to ensure peace and stability in Northeast Asia.""Matching its words  with concrete illustrations, the United States was also displaying its military versatility by deploying B-2 and B-52 planes with nuclear capabilities over South Korea, while also flying F-22 Raptor fighter jets from Japan to South Korea's Osan Air base. As well, as noted below, the United States said it would deploy additional ballistic-missile interceptors along the country's Pacific Coast, with an eye on protecting the United States from a potential attack from North Korea.  As well, the United States  moved its  sea-based  X-Band radar platform, normally based in Hawaii, closer to the North Korean coast, with the intent of monitoring  potential attempts from North Korea to launch a long-range missile.  By April 2013, the United States  additionally decided to deploy an anti-missile system to Guam.Tensions on the Korean Peninsular escalated on April 2, 2013 when  the state-controlled Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) of the North Korea announced that it would be re-opening its main nuclear complex at Yongbyon and restarting its nuclear reactor there.The Yongbyon complex was home to both a uranium enrichment facility and a nuclear reactor; it  was closed as a part of a 2007 agreement between North Korea and a multilateral cadre, including China and the United States.  The agreement mandated the closure of the reactor at Yongbyon  in lieu of one million metric tons of heavy fuel oil as well as humanitarian aid benefits.The agreement was only really in effect for a couple of years since  North Korea resumed the reprocessing of  fuel rods stored at the site in 2009, complaining that it did not receive the desired level of energy assistance.This 2013 decision to open the Yongbyon complex and restart operations of the nuclear reactor was illustrative of  the intensification of dissonance on the Korean peninsular ongoing since late 2012.  But it was also a disturbing development as it showed that the new leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un, was not interested in continuing to honor a deal approved by his late father, Kim Jong-il.  Clearly, the international community was now regarding the paranoid and alienated nation state of nuclearized North Korea through the valence of anxiety.Reflecting this sentiment, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he was ""deeply dismayed"" by North Korea's decision to re-open the main nuclear complex at Yongbyon and restart the nuclear reactor.  He further condemned the provocative actions declaring: ""The current crisis has already gone too far. Nuclear threats are not a game. Aggressive rhetoric and military posturing only result in counter-actions, and fuel fear and instability.""Secretary General Ban urged all partied to engage in urgent talks as  ""the only way to resolve the current crisis."" However, with North Korea cutting off its military hot-line with South Korea, canceling its armistice with that country,  using the rhetoric of war, and re-opening its Yongbyon facility, it seemed that authorities in Pyongyang were not in the mood for productive diplomatic engagement.Indeed, a day later on April 3, 2013,  North Korea has ceased border crossing access for South Koreans into the jointly-administered Kaesong industrial zone. Since Kaesong has been viewed as a tacit symbol of the state of geopolitical relations and the last significant arena of cooperation between the two Koreas, the cessation of cross-border access at the industrial zone was regarded as a disturbing development.

By April 4, 2013, the state-controlled Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said the military had ""ratified"" an attack on United States interests.  The KCNA statement further noted that North Korean troops had been authorized to counteract American aggression with ""powerful practical military counteractions,"" including nuclear weapons, and involving ""cutting-edge smaller, lighter, and diversified nuclear strike means.""  The KCNA statement included the following warning: ""The moment of explosion is approaching fast. No one can say a war will break out in Korea or not and whether it will break out today or tomorrow.""  The expressed nuclear threat was the most blatant and belligerent exposition from the North Korean regime on global stability in recent memory.  Raising the  threat to another level, Pyongyang also told foreign embassies that it could not guarantee their safety in the event of conflict.   

In a speech to the National Defense University in Washington, United States Defense Scretary Chuck Hagel noted that the recent actions of the North Koreans ""present a real and clear danger.""  Meanwhile, Russian  foreign ministry spokesperson, Alexander Lukashevich, observed that North Korea's actions may very well foreclose the notion of multilateral negotiations .  He cast Pyongyang's attempts to violate decisions of the United Nations Security Council"" as  ""categorically unacceptable,"" and issued the following warning: ""This radically complicates, if it doesn't in practice shut off, the prospects for resuming six-party talks.""On April 5, 2013, Western officials were confirming reports that North Korea had moved a medium-range missile, known as a Musudan or Nodong B, to its east coast. It was unknown if the move was to be interpreted as a threatening gesture , with a warhead mounted on the missile, or part of the preparations for test firing.  There was growing suspicion  that North Korea might, in fact, be preparing to carry out yet another missile test. It should be noted that while this Musidan/Nodong B missile has a range of 3,000 kilometers (1,875 miles), which would put all of South Korea, Japan, and possibly Guam in its range, there was no test history to ensure precision. As noted by  Greg Thielmann, a senior fellow at the Arms Control Association,  ""A missile that has never even had a flight test is not an operational system and is not a credible threat."" Of course,  a missile launch might be in the offing for the purpose of acquiring that test history.By April 10, 2013, South Korean sources said that North Korea appeared to be preparing to launch the Musudan mid-range ballistic missile that had been moved to the east coast, and warned that North Korea might even be preparing the fire the Musudan simultaneously with shorter range Nodong and Scud missiles.  The missiles launch could conceivably coincide with the celebration of the birthday of Kim Il-sung, the country's founder.Meanwhile, the rhetoric from North Korea continued to be bellicose with North Korean state media asserting that the scenario on the  Korean Peninsula situation was ""inching close to a thermonuclear war,""  and authorities in Pyongyang warning foreign nationals in  South Korea to evacuate from that country.  The Obama administration in the United States, via White House spokesperson, Jay Carney, characterized North Korea's statements as ""unhelpful.""  Carney continued, ""This kind of rhetoric will only further isolate North Korea from the international community and we continue to urge the North Korean leadership to heed President Obama's call to choose the path of peace and to come into compliance with its international obligations.""It should be noted that the foreign ministers of the so-called G-8 countries -- the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy,  Canada, Japan, and Russia -- have condemned North Korea's recent actions, and warned of consequences in North Korea conducts either a missile launch or a nuclear test.  On April 12, 2013, United States Secretary of State John Kerry traveled to South Korea and accentuated this multilateral warning, saying ""If Kim Jong-Un decides to launch a missile, whether it is across the Sea of Japan or some other direction, he will be choosing willfully to ignore the entire international community.""A day later, Secretary of State Kerry  met with Chinese leaders to find ways to end the geopolitical crisis brewing on the Korean peninsular.  Following that meeting, Secretary Kerry said that the United States and China were both calling for North Korea to refrain from further provocative actions. It was clear that the international community was united in its stance against North Korea's recent acts of dangerous provocation.Secretary of State John Kerry ended his Asian trip with a call for negotiations to end the dissonance and emphasizing the imperative of finding  a diplomatic solution. He said, ""The United States remains open to authentic and credible negotiations on denuclearization, but the burden is on Pyongyang. North Korea must take meaningful steps to show that it will honor commitments it has already made, and it has to observe laws and the norms of international behavior.""Meanwhile, with an eye on decreasing the tensions between the two Koreas, South Korean President Park Geun-hye called for peaceful dialogue.  But North  Korea was quick to reject the overture, characterizing the offer of talks as a  ""cunning ploy.""  If that response was any indication, North Korea remained defiant in the face of international pressure.April 15, 2013 -- the  anniversary of North Korea's founder's birth -- passed fairly quietly, without a continuation of the bellicose war threats and even free of a huge military parade showcasing North Korean military might.  The hopes that North Korea might be digesting the call for talks, and that the heated geopolitical climate had cooled for the moment, dissipated as Pyongyang issued new threats of war.  A statement via state-controlled media was issued as follows: ""Our retaliatory action will start without any notice from now.""It should be noted that South Korea  responded to the recent actions of North Korea by deploying two warships with  the Aegis missile defense systems on the east and west coasts.  As well, Japan deployed missile defense systems around Tokyo to defend against any missile threat by North Korea.On April 18, 2013, North Korea's National Defense Commission issued a statement via the official Korean Central News Agency, demanding that the United States and South Korea withdraw ""all nuclear war making capabilities from the region,"" with an eye on future dialogue.  North Korea also called for  Washington and Seoul to apologize for its  aggression.In response, a spokesperson for the  White House, Josh Earnest,  said that the Obama administration was committed to denuclearization of the Korean peninsular and was open to ""authentic and credible negotiations.""  Earnest noted that the  actions and rhetoric from North Korea ""actually indicate the opposite.""  He added, ""We also need to see some clear evidence that the North Koreans themselves are willing to live up to their international obligations, are willing to demonstrate their commitment to ending the nuclear program, something they've promised in the past.""By April 21, 2013, North Korea was reported to have moved two short-range missile launchers to the east coast. According to a South Korean military source in a report by the South Korean Yonhap news agency, satellite imagery showed the transfer of two mobile missile launchers suitable for short-range Scud missiles to the South Hamgyeong province. Earlier in the month, as noted above, two mid-range Musudan missiles were place on launchers on the east coast. Collectively, these actions indicated that a missile launch might be in the offing -- possibly to mark the anniversary of the founding of the North Korean military on April 25. However, that date passed without any events of note.In the last week of April 2013, South Korea called on North Korea to engage in dialogue over the Kaesong industrial complex, which had become a flashpoint in the ongoing crisis between the two Koreas. Regarded as a symbol of cooperation between North Korea and South Korea, the decision by the North to block access to the jointly-run industrial complex was interpreted as a clear sign of deteriorating relations, devolving diplomacy, and the slide towards confrontation. That slide became more precipitous when North Korea outright rejected the invitation to engage in talks. South Korea, therefore, responded by withdrawing its nationals from the Kaesong industrial zone in the interests of safety.

On May 6, 2013,  CBS News reported that the two Musudan medium-range missiles, which had been moved to the east coast of North Korea weeks prior, were now removed from the launch site. Those missiles, as discussed above,  had sufficient range to reach Japan as well as the United States territory of Guam in the Pacific.     

The movement of the missiles was being interpreted in some circles as a cooling of the heated tensions on the Korean Peninsular. Of course, with the start of the spring farming season, it was also possible that many members of the army were -- as they do each year --  necessarily turning their attention to the planting effort.Regardless of the rationale, the removal of the Musudan missiles from the launch site conceivably indicated that the threat posed by North Korea was reduced at this time, if only on a temporary basis.  Indeed, since the Musudan is a mobile missile, it could well be transported back to the launch site in short order.  As noted by a senior United States official from the National Security Council in an interview with BBC News, it was ""premature to celebrate it as good news,"" given North Korea's record of unpredictable behavior to date. Striking a similar tone, George Little, a Pentagon spokesperson,  characterized North Korea's most recent stance as ""a provocation pause.""May 2013 saw North Korea carry out a series of short-range missile tests from its east coast.  As global leaders attempted to bring down the level of tensions on the Korean Peninsular,  and even after North Korea pulled back its two medium range missiles from its launch pad, the firing of four -- albeit short range -- missiles was being regarded as a provocation.  It was not known if North Korea was trying to re-ignite geo-political tensions or if the tests were routine exercises intended to simply show military might. Regardless, United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon  urged North Korea to refrain from carrying out any further missile tests and ""resume dialogue.""

On June 6, 2013, North Korea proposed convening talks with South Korea over the jointly-administered Kaesong industrial zone, which had been shut down months earlier amidst heightened tensions.  The proposal  also included a provision to restart tours at the Mount Kumgang resort, which was suspended when a South Korea tourist was shot by a North Korean guard in 2008.     In regards to the more recent closure of the industrial complex,  more than 50,000 North Korean workers at Kaesong were withdrawn and South Koreans and supplies were banned entry as part of North Korea's illustration that it was in a ""state of war"" with South Korea.  As intimated above in the ""Background"" note, the Kaesong complex has often been viewed as a symbol of cross-border cooperation between the two Koreas and its closure augured negatively as regards the overall geo-political security on the Korean Peninsular. But with North Korea's Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea offering the overture of dialogue on Kaeosong and Mount Kumgang,  it was believed that an effort was being made to de-escalate tensions and move to a more constructive footing.     

North Korea's Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea issued the following statement outlining its proposal of dialogue: ""We propose holding talks between authorities of the North and South for the normalization of operations at Kaesong and the resumption of tours to Mount Kumgang on the occasion of the anniversary of the June 15 joint declaration.""  South Korea's Ministry of Unification, which administers inter-Korean affairs, said the government in Seoul was ""considering the proposal in a positive light."" Earlier, South Korea made it clear that given the precipitous and dangerous decline in bilateral relations during the first part of 2013, it would not only consider government level engagement with North Korea.One day later on June 7, 2013, South Korea accepted North Korea's offer of bilateral talks but insisted that rather than have them take place in the  North Korean border town of Kaesong, that the dialogue site be in the  truce village of Panmunjom in the demilitarized zone between the countries.  South Korea also  noted that it was interested in taking up a range of issues, including the Kaesong Industrial Complex, the tourist center at Mount Kumgang, and the notion of family reunions.  The North reacted to South Korea's stance in a rare show of cordiality  asserting the following via a statement: ""We appreciate the fact that the South side promptly and positively responded to the proposal made by us for holding talks between the authorities of both sides.""It should be noted that the North Korean government in Pyongyang also said that if Seoul accepted its proposal, it would also re-establish the emergency hotline channels, which were severed earlier in the year, as noted above.But optimism about diplomatic progress between the two Koreas plummeted on June 11, 2013, when despite the fact that preliminary talks on technical and administrative details were reported to have gone smoothly.  By June 13, 2013, more details emerged related to the cancellation of the negotiations.  The cause was attributed to the composition of the respective delegations at the negotiating table in the first ministerial level talks since 2007.Originally, South Korean Unification Minister Ryoo Kihl-jae was slated to lead South Korea's delegation.  When South Korea requested that North Korea send Kim Yang-gon, an adviser to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un,  to the talks, North Korea declined.  Seoul then decided to dispatch  Vice-Unification Minister Kim Nam-shik to lead its delegation instead.  North Korea took offense to the apparent ""downgraded"" level of South Korean officials present  at the talks  and decided to withdraw completely.  North Korea placed the blame on South Korea for ""arrogant obstruction"" and ""deliberate disturbance"" resulting in the aborted negotiations.  North Korea further characterized South Korea's decision to change the composition of its delegation in this manner as ""the height of discourtesy and disrespect unprecedented in the history of the North-South dialogue"".For its part, South Korea  said it was disappointed with North Korea's response.  South Korea also made it clear that  it would not be offering to participate in negotiations with North Korea at any point in the near future.  As noted by South Korean Prime Minister Chung Hong-won: ""In the past, we have made infinite concessions to the North, but the time has come to hold talks where both sides are represented by officials of the same level.""At the start of July 2013, relations between the two Koreas seemed to be moving in a more productive direction when North Korea agreed to hold talks on the Kaesong industrial complex, only hours after South Korea suggested  the meeting.  It was hoped that this overture would end more positively than the situation in June 2013 when the proposed Kaesong discussions were halted over procedural disagreements, as discussed just above.  However, as of mid-July 2013, there was no immediate agreement reached on resuming operations at their joint Kaesong industrial complex.With relations between the two Koreas at a stalemate of sorts in mid-June 2013 (subsequently improved in early July 2013, as discussed above), it came as something of a surprise when North Korea proposed direct talks with the United States.  North Korea's  National Defense Commission, headed by North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un, said it hoped for ""serious discussions... to secure peace and stability.""  The United States responded to this overture by saying it looked towards  ""credible negotiations,"" made clear that North Korea had to be compliant with United Nations resolutions and travel down the path of denuclearization.At the start of July 2013, North Korea renewed its push for engagement with the United States when Choi Myung-nam, an international affairs director at the North Korean Foreign Ministry, said Washington should take Pyongyang's diplomatic offers seriously. It should be noted that while representatives of the United States and North Korea have held meetings sporadically, the two sides have not  engaged in high-level talks since 2009.Meanwhile, in the third week of June 2013, North Korea was apparently building on its sudden appetite for diplomatic engagement as it expressed an interest in restarting international nuclear negotiations.  According to  China's foreign ministry, North Korean officials were now indicating that they wanted to ""peacefully resolve the nuclear issue.""  It should be noted that multilateral talks between North Korea, South Korea, China, Japan, Russia, and the United States over North Korea's controversial nuclear program collapsed in 2008.  North Korea's renewed interest in diplomatic engagement at the multilateral level came as a result of high-level strategic talks with Chinese officials in Beijing. It was to be seen if an actual return to the multilateral negotiating table was in the offing.In mid-August 2013,  the two Koreas were  able to successfully reach an agreement to re-open the jointly-administered Kaesong industrial complex.  The accord between the two countries included a provision ensuring that Pyongyang would never again shut the industrial complex -- often viewed as a symbol of cross-border cooperation --  ""under any circumstances.""  Another key provision of the accord was the move to  ""internationalize"" the Kaesong industrial complex by hosting foreign visitors at the factory park. This element would effectively make it harder for  North Korea to take any unilateral action involving the facility.  Left unspecified at the time was a precise date for the reopening of the facility and the resumption of regular operations.By September 2013  the two Koreas agreed on a ""trial"" start date of Sept. 16, 2013.  It should be noted that agreement was also forged in regard to exempting South Korean firms from taxes for the rest of 2013  to offset losses incurred during the period of months when the complex was closed.  Agreement was also made to facilitate easier access to the complex for South Koreans carrying out commercial responsibilities, and for the purpose of attracting foreign investors to the Kaesong Industrial Complex.

Editor's Note       China declared air defense zone in East China Sea       In late November 2013, China tested the patience of the international community by declaring a new defense zone in the  East China Sea.  To that end, China  announced it was deploying warplanes in the new  air defense identification zone (ADIZ)  for surveillance purposes.  However, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Qin Gang noted that if disputes occurred in the region, his country hoped to resolve them through ""peaceful means via friendly negotiation.""       China's self-declaration of dominion over the territory and its warning that all airplanes passing through the area were to  file flight plans and identify themselves or  be prepared to deal with ""defensive emergency measures"" likely raised the ire of neighbors. Indeed,  the new  air defense identification zone (ADIZ) included contested territory claimed not only by China, but also Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea.  Of particular note were uninhabited but disputed islands in the area known as Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu by the Chinese.  Their significance has, in the past, focused on fishing rights and shipping lanes; however, there was also the possibility of fossil fuel reserves in the area.        

The United States Department of State characterized China's  newly declared defense zone as ""an attempt to unilaterally change the status quo in the East China Sea"" and accordingly warned that it would ""raise regional tensions and increase the risk of miscalculation, confrontation and accidents.""  In defiance of China's decision to  declare the new ADIZ, the United States and Japan respectively ordered fighters jets to be flown through this area of the East China Sea. China was  thus prompted to  scramble warplanes to monitor those American and Japanese fighter jets crossing through the ADIZ.For both Japan and the United States, the message was clear: they did not officially recognize  China's newly declared defense zone in East China Sea.  That being  said, the United States was quick to note that its decision to fly fighter jets through the ADIZ was not intended to be a provocative act.  An official for the United States military told CNN News that its aircrafts and a number of other Japanese military aircraft flew through the ADIZ  without incident and as part of scheduled routine operations.  The military official was quoted as saying, ""This is status quo. We are not changing what we are doing. We are not trying to make a point with China. We fly U.S. aircraft daily in international airspace in the region. This is normal.""South Korea also reportedly dispatched a military aircraft  on a routine patrol flight into the ADIZ and did not alert China of its flight plan. An official from the South Korean Defense Ministry said the flight was routine and  carried out twice a week; the South Korean official said the patrols would continue irrespective of China's newly declared defense zone in East China Sea.Still, several commercial airlines, such as Qantas Airlines and Singapore Airlines, were not prepared to take any chances of their own and made it clear that they intended to act in accordance with China's new regulations.  As well, the United States advised American commercial carriers to comply with China's new requirements for filing flight plans  when they traverse the newly declared ADIZ over the East China Sea for obvious security reasons.  It was to be seen if the matter would spark a dispute, especially since at least two Japanese airlines announced they would not be complying with the new Chinese-dictated regulations.Complicating matters was an announcement from South Korea on Dec. 8, 2013 that it was expanding its  own air defense zone, which that area partially overlapping  with China's zone.  At issue was the Ieodo rock claimed by both countries and controlled by South Korea.  As noted here, South Korea was already challenging China's ADIZ by flying its military aircraft through that zone. The moves were expected to raise already-heightened tensions in eastern Asia.Meanwhile, in the first week of December 2013, while United States Vice President Joseph Biden was on a trip to Asia, the matter of China's self-declare air defense zone was a matter of discussion.  In a joint appearance with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Tokyo, Vice President Biden said, ""We, the United States, are deeply concerned by the attempt to unilaterally change the status quo in the East China Sea. This action has raised regional tensions and increased the risk of accidents and miscalculation."" Biden said the United States was monitoring the situation with  Japan and South Korea and noted that ""we will remain steadfast in our alliance commitments.""  He continued, ""The United States has an interest in the lowering of tensions in this vital region. This underscores the need for crisis management mechanisms and effective channels of communication between China and Japan to reduce the risk of escalation.""Vice President Biden then engaged in ""very direct""  talks regarding the ADIZ  with Chinese officials.While China asserted its view that its self-declare air defense zone was consistent with ""international law and practice,""  Vice President Biden pointed out that the move had caused ""apprehension"" in Asia and he noted that  China had ""increasing responsibility to contribute positively to peace and security."" But Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said: ""During the talks the Chinese side repeated its principled position, stressing that the Chinese move accorded with international law and practice.""  Thus, it was clear -- at least in the public purview -- that neither the United States nor China were prepared to step back from the expressly-stated stances.

Update        Relations with North Korea        On Feb. 27, 2014, North Korea fired four short-range missiles over the sea off its eastern coast -- essentially to the north of the border with South Korea. The South Korea Yonhap News Agency speculated that the missiles were Scud short-range missiles with a  capacity of traversing 125 miles and thus capable of reaching targets in South Korea but not as far as Japan.        

On March 2, 2014, North Korea fired another two short-range missiles into the sea off the eastern coast of the Korean peninsula.  The South Korea Yonhap news Agency reported that the missiles likely flew about 300 miles and were believed to be  Scud-C models -- this time capable of reaching targets in both South Korea and Japan.In the third week of March 2014, North Korea fired  a series of 30 short-range rockets into the sea off the eastern end of the Korean peninsula. The rockets were thought to be Soviet-era FROG rockets that have been in North Korea's possession since the 1960s, and seemingly flew for more than 35 miles before landing in the sea.  This launch of the 30 FROG missiles came after other such missile tests in the weeks prior, as discussed above.In the last week of March 2014, North Korea test fired two medium range Nodong missiles, which landed in the ocean between North Korea and Japan.  The action essentially triggered a condemnation from the United Nations Security Council, which noted that the missile launches were a violation of prevailing United Nations resolutions, such as  Security Council Resolutions 1718  and  1874 that prohibit North Korea from carrying out ballistic or nuclear activity.  The United Nations Security Council also warned  of an ""appropriate response"" to come.  Undeterred, North Korea lashed back at the United Nations Security Council, characterizing its condemnation as  ""absolutely intolerable"" and justifying its own action as being a ""self-defensive"" move.There were suggestions that North Korea was reacting to the  annual joint military exercises by United States and South Korean forces, which Pyongyang typically characterizes as acts of war and aggression.  Fueling the fire for North Korea was the flight of a United States nuclear-capable B-52 bomber  over South Korea.  South Korean authorities have put forth the theory that North Korea's missile launched constituted an ""armed protest"" against the joint South Korean-United States military drills that were taking place.Perhaps exasperated by North Korea's provocative acts and  saber rattling, which were manifest most recently by the missile launches, China had already entered the equation.  Even before the launch of the medium range missiles in the last week of March 2014,  China hard earlier  declared a ""red line,"" saying that it would not allow  war or chaos on  the Korean peninsula, and  asserting that peace was possible only  via  denuclearization. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi was on the record saying, ""The Korean peninsula is right on China's doorstep. We have a red line, that is, we will not allow war or instability on the Korean peninsula."" Wang demanded that  all parties  ""exercise restraint"" and noted that ""genuine and lasting peace"" on the Korean peninsula was only possible with denuclearization.  He said, ""Confrontation can only bring tension, and war can only cause disaster.""  The Chinese foreign minister also endorsed the resumption of multilateral nuclear talks, saying, ""Some dialogue is better than none, and better early than later.""This stance by China -- North Korea's most  important diplomatic and economic supporter -- suggested that Beijing was no longer willing to accept Pyongyang's theatrics on its doorstep.Pressure on North Korea had already begun to intensify a month earlier in February 2014 when the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, urged global powers  to refer North Korea to the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court following a report that documented horrific crimes against humanity in that country.While China was unlikely to join the human rights chorus against North Korea, it certainly seemed prepared to use its influence to compel  North Korea to return to the nuclear negotiating table.  Adding to the suggestion that dialogue might be at hand, Japan and North Korea were scheduled to engage in their first high level talks in years.However, the nuclear negotiating table appeared to be a distant notion as March 2014 came to a close, and as North Korea threatened to go forward with a nuclear test.  As reported by the North Korean Central News Agency, North Korea said it would not foreclose the possibility of testing a ""new form"" nuclear weapon in defiance of international condemnation and in contravention of prevailing international law. While Pyongyang did not specify the type of nuclear weaponry it intended to test, the conventional wisdom has long been  held that North Korea was attempting to develop small and sophisticated nuclear devices that could be delivered by intercontinental ballistic missiles.South Korea warned that if its neighbor to the north went forward with a nuclear test, there would be consequences in the offing.  As noted by South Korea Foreign Ministry spokesman Cho Tae-young, ""North Korea should bear in mind that if it ignores the stern demand from the neighboring countries and the international community and carries out a nuclear test, it will have to pay a price for it.""On March 31, 2014, tensions on the Korean peninsula exponentially increased as North Korea and South Korea exchanged fire across its western maritime border.According to South Korean authorities, this exchange of fire was presaged by North Korea's announcement that it would hold ""live fire"" military drills along its border zone with South Korea.  South Korea warned that there would be immediate retaliation if any ordinance touched its jurisdiction.  North Korea then fired more than 500 artillery rounds, some 100 of which landed in South Korean territorial waters.  As promised,  the South Koreans responded by firing  more than 300 rounds into  North Korean waters and scrambling F-15s on its side of the maritime border.Known as the Northern Limit Line, the maritime border has been a well known flashpoint region between the two Koreas, and its very existence is a matter of dispute from the point of view of the North Koreans. The boundary was established after the end of the Korean War in the 1950s by the United Nations, but the line of demarcation has been accepted by North Korea.It should be noted that North Korean artillery fire killed four South Koreans on the Yeonpyeong border island in the same disputed area in 2010.  In another egregious incident in 2010, North Korea torpedoed a South Korean warship in the disputed border region, sinking the vessel and killing 46 people.  Now, in 2014, it was again the locus of dissonance between the two Koreas as a result of the North's decision to hold military drills in this hotspot region.It was to be seen if these were actions by North Korea were aimed at improving Pyongyang's negotiating position for the future as it attempted to stave off further sanctions that were likely to come, or, if they were intended to be blatant and irrational acts of provocation.  South Korean Defence Ministry spokesperson,  Kim Min-seok, intimated that Pyongyang's actions were being motivated by both factors as he said, ""We believe the North's maritime firing is a planned provocation and an attempt to test our military's determination to defend the Northern Limit Line and to get an upper hand in South-North relations.""In mid-August 2014, North Korea fired three short range rockets from the port city of Wonsan; the rockets landed in the sea off the east coast of the Korean peninsula.  The incident coincided with Pope Francis' arrival in South Korea for a five day visit and ahead of scheduled joint military exercises between South Korea and the United States.  North Korea objects to those drills, charging that they are intended to prepare for war.  As such, North Korea has typically taken some sort of provocative action to protest the joint military activity.  In this case, North Korea reacted with the firing of the rockets as well as the issuance of a statement that read as follows: ""Given that the U.S. and the puppet forces of South Korea continue staging nuclear war exercises against us in particular, we will take countermeasures for self-defense which will include missile launches, nuclear tests, and all other programs.""  It was to be seen if North Korea would indeed follow up the rocket launches with nuclear tests, as indicated. 

Special Note           

Relations with Holy SeeIn August 2014, Pope Francis arrived in South Korea where he was due to stay for a five day visit.  It was to be Pope Francis' first visit to Asia since he became pontiff. In South Korea, where Roman Catholics make up about 10 percent of the population, Pope Francis was greeted by enthusiastic crowds. During his landmark visit,  Pope Francis celebrated mass,  lauded the Korean Catholics -- many of whom died for their religion in previous centuries, and  beatified 124 South Korean Catholic martyrs with hundreds of thousands of South Koreans in attendance.Pope Francis' popularity among South Koreans was partially due his decision to travel around Seoul in a small and unpretentious hatch-back car -- a sharp contrast from the type  of status-symbol laden vehicle that one would expect for almost any other world leader.* denotes territory

Political Conditions

Introduction

For over a decade, North Korea has lived through one upheaval after another. Political unrest, economic troubles and diplomatic isolation combined have put the country into an impoverished and desperate situation. Positive trends appeared to have been emerging in 1999. Events from 2001 onward, however, would take the country in a less positive path in the realm of geopolitics.

Still, throughout 1999, North Korea made all-out national efforts to pull itself back from the brink. As Pyongyang's media put it, ""It is the unswerving will and resolution of our leader to concentrate national efforts on the economy so as to put our country on the path toward an economic power."" As a result, according to reports from a South Korean government think tank, North Korea's grain output in 1999 was estimated at 4.2 million tons, an 8.5 percent increase from that of 1998. This was the highest since floods devastated the North's harvest in 1995. In 1999, North Korea's economy stopped shrinking and recorded 6.2 percent growth, the first positive growth in 10 years.

Key political issues in North Korea in the last decade have been focused on its relationship with South Korea. In 1992, an accord was signed stipulating non-aggression, reconciliation, and cooperative exchanges between North and South Korea. Meanwhile, impoverished North Korea has been the recipient of humanitarian aid from South Korea, despite the prevailing hostilities between the two entities.

In June 1999, talks began between North and South Korea, in Beijing, over the hopes and plans for reunification of the two factions of the Korean peninsular, and to put into effect the stipulations of the 1992 accord. The major aspects of the accord involved the reunification of estranged families who had been divided by the political fate of the peninsula, reconciliation, cooperation, a climate of entente and the long-term possibility of reunification. It was hoped that this kind of substantive engagement could be realized by separating business from politics, and by emphasizing the shared ideals designated in the 1992 accord.

In early 2000, the world saw big steps taken by the two Koreas toward the goal of rapprochement. On April 8, 2000, delegates from both Koreas signed an agreement in Beijing, China announcing that a summit would be held between the top leaders of both Koreas in Pyongyang in mid-June 2000. The agreement on the summit had been the result of mutual efforts by the leaders of the two sides of the peninsula.

As early as in 1981, South Korean President Chun Doo-hwan suggested direct talks between South and North Korean leaders, but was rejected by North Korean President Kim Il Sung. In February 1993, South Korean President Kim Young-sam also suggested a summit with Kim Il Sung, and Kim Il Sung accepted the suggestion in June 1994. But the scheduled summit was canceled due to Kim Il Sung's sudden death on July 8, 1994.

After taking office in early 1998, South Korean President Kim Dae-jung expressed a desire to meet with North Korea's leader, saying a summit could help end hostilities between the Koreas. Indeed, in the late 1990s, inter-Korean trade had grown, and the number of visitors from the South to the North had increased.

In February 1999, in an open letter, the North Korean government proposed to the South Korean authorities that the year 1999 be set as a year for enhancing national reconciliation and unity. It also proposed wide-ranging dialogue between the two governments.

On March 17, 2000, delegates of Seoul and Pyongyang met in China in anticipation of the summit between Kim Dae-jung and Kim Jong il. All these contributed to the final decision that the summit between the North and South Korean top leaders be held  in June 2000. From June 13-15, 2000, North Korean leader Kim Jong il and South Korean President Kim Dae-jung met in Pyongyang; it was the first summit of its type since the end of the Korean War in 1950s. The summit had been scheduled to start on June 12, but was postponed one day by Pyongyang for ""technical reasons."" To the world's surprise, Kim Jong il personally greeted Kim Dae-jung at the airport when the South president arrived in Pyongyang for the summit. After this historic moment, North Korean leader Kim Jong il and South Korean President Kim Dae-jung signed a historic accord called ""North-South Joint Declaration"" at the end of the second day of the three-day summit. With the aim of reducing tension in the divided peninsula and working towards an eventual reunification, the Joint Declaration covered five issues: (1) the North and the South agreed to resolve the country's reunification independently; (2) both sides agreed to work for the reunification in the direction based on the proposal of federation by the North and that of confederation by the South with common elements; (3) both sides agreed to settle the problems of the separated families and long-term prisoners, and exchange of visiting groups of separated families was to start Aug. 15, 2000; (4) the North and the South would promote economic cooperation and cooperation in social, cultural, sports, public health and environmental fields; and (5) both sides agreed to remain in contact to assure that this agreement would be implemented. The summit was seen as a turning point in the inter-Korean relations. It has been the first formal step in the bilateral efforts for reunification. The agreement reached by the leaders of both Koreas during the summit was far more detailed than those reached by lower-ranking officials in 1972 and 1991. Although the agreement did not mention certain major issues, such as South Korea's concern over the North's nuclear and missile programs and the North's demand for the withdrawal of 37,000 United States (U.S.) troops stationed in the South, the summit -- at the time -- opened the door for future discussions for those issues. The two leaders also agreed that North Korean leader Kim Jong il would pay a return visit to the South in the near future. On Aug. 15, 2000, a significant move toward reconciliation took place on the Korean Peninsula. Seoul and Pyongyang exchanged 100 people from each side by air for a four-day reunion with family members separated for more than 50 years. The airplane carrying 100 North Koreans flew to Seoul from Pyongyang and returned to Pyongyang with 100 South Koreans one hour later. This was also the first North Korean airplane allowed runway privileges in the South since the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950s. On Aug. 18, the South Korea airplane brought the 100 North Koreans back to Pyongyang and returned with the 100 South Koreans. The exchange of the 200 people was part of the June 15 Joint Declaration reached in Pyongyang. More than 75,000 South Koreans applied for the reunions with their relatives in North Korea, but the number was narrowed down to 100 by computerized lottery, giving priority to those with a direct family relationship, such as parents, spouses and children.  In November, the two Koreas went on the second such exchanges for family reunion. At the time, an estimated 7.6 million South Koreans had relatives in North Korea. About 1.2 million North Koreans escaped to the South during the Korean conflict, with  thousands of South Koreans went to the North.  In late January 2001, South and North Korea held the three-day inter-Korean Red Cross talks and reached a six-point agreement on reunions and communication between separated family members. According to the agreement, 300 family members from each side would be allowed to exchange letters on March 15, the first exchange of its kind since the Korean War in 1950s.  Another high profile progress in reconciliation of the two Koreas was the plan to re-link the two sides by road and rail. Defense ministers of North and South Korea met in September 2000 for the first time since the Korean War and agreed to seek military cooperation for the cross-border railway. In November of that year, the military officers from both sides met again to hold their first talks on restoring road and railway links across the world's most heavily fortified border. The Korean War had cut off transport links in early 1950s, and the project to reconnect transport includes the main railway from Seoul to Pyongyang and a four-lane highway parallel to it through the demilitarized zone. For a few years, the reconstruction of the inter-Korean railway and highway was under way by both sides in the demilitarized zone. The two sides also agreed to jointly manage the reconstruction and operation of the railroad and highway in the demilitarized zone.  Until early 2001, the two Koreas had held four rounds of ministerial level talks aimed at accelerating steps in reconciliation and cooperation. During these talks, the two sides agreed to set up an inter-Korean committee for economic cooperation, and such a committee was established in late December 2000. Senior economic officials from North and South Korea talked about ways to boost economic cooperation, including North Korea's urgent request for electricity supplies from the South to ease its chronic energy shortages. In early January 2001, South Korea delivered a draft agreement on economic cooperation to North Korea, which included the provision of electricity, measures to prevent Imjin River flooding, construction of rail and road links, and the building of an industrial complex in North Korea.Meanwhile, there were signs that North Korea was making progress in changing its image of seclusion, being more open to the outside world. What was most obvious was its desire or interest in economic reforms. In October 2000, just days after North and South Korea agreed to establish a joint economic cooperation committee, the North Korean government replaced the country's finance minister and Central Bank president. Two months later, the trade minister of North Korea was also replaced with someone having expertise in trade with Western countries. The replacement of the top financial and trade officials suggested that North Korea was serious about economic reforms by bringing its financial and trade systems more in line with international norms.In November 2000, officials from the European Union paid a three-day visit to North Korea's capital Pyongyang. During the visit the North Korean officials told them that the country might relax its investment rules by allowing multinational companies full control over any investment in the country.In his New Year's speech for 2001, Kim Jong il called for ""new thinking,"" portraying himself as the Kim Il Sung of the 21st century. One of the most dramatic moves was North Korean leader Kim Jong il's visit to China.In mid-January 2001, Kim Jong il paid a six-day visit to China, most of the time visiting Shanghai, the city at the center of China's economic reform effort. There were reports that he visited Shanghai's stock market as well as huge factories run by foreign corporations. It was reported that Kim was very interested in the economic achievements China had made since its reforms in early 1980s, and Kim's comment after the visit was that China's market reform policies were correct.

North Korea's Slide into Greater Isolation; 2001-2006

The momentum towards normalization of relations between North Korea and the outside world was slowed with the election of United States (U.S.)  President George W. Bush. Early in his administration President Bush ordered a review of United States policy towards North Korea and the Bush Administration made it clear that improved relations with the United States depended on progress across a broad range of security issues -- including force deployments, nuclear weapons and missiles.  The U.S. - North Korea relationship was then dealt a blow with the terrorist attack against the United States on Sept. 11, 2001. In a speech in early 2002 on terrorism and global security, the American leader referred to North Korea as a member of the ""axis of evil,"" along with Iran and Iraq. This designation resulted in retrenchment by North Korea and saber rattling on both sides.  As well, there was an awkward tension between South Korea and the United States that grew out of the situation. As noted in this review, South Korea has expressed the desire for eventual reunification with North Korea, in accordance with the sunshine policy of former South Korean President Kim Dae-jung.  At the same time, the South wants to maintain a good relationship with the United States. The American position on North Korea placed South Korea in a difficult situation.  In September 2002, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi of Japan held a summit meeting with Kim Jong il. The focus of the meeting was to foster improved relationships between Japan and North Korea. The meeting signaled an interesting drift in Japanese foreign policy towards a view independent of the United States on policy in North Korea.  In October 2002, following talks between North Korea's government representatives and United States Special Envoy, James Kelly, North Korea accused the United States of arrogance and high-handedness. The discussions were launched because Japan and South Korea expressed similar desires to ameliorate their relations with North Korea and end diplomatic isolation. In this regard, these discussions embodied the highest level diplomatic contact between North Korea and the United States since United States President, George Bush, referred to North Korea as one third of the ""axis of evil"" as aforementioned.  North Korean outrage about the Kelly's handling of the talks was reportedly due to the United States' insistence over missiles programs, human rights matters, and other military issues. North Korea's government stated that it was apparent that the United States was not really interested in a bilateral dialogue but rather, the United States wished to pursue a continued policy of hostility, arrogance and high-handed practices in its relations with North Korea. For its part, the United States Special Envoy, James Kelly, described the discussions as ""frank.""  

A week later, North Korea admitted it had been developing a clandestine nuclear weapons program. This nuclear weapons endeavor was in contravention of a 1994 accord, which provided for the end of any such weapons programs, in exchange for the construction of two nuclear power reactors. The situation was complicated by the fact that some reports suggest that Pakistan -- a United States ally in the war on terrorism -- may have provided North Korea with equipment used to develop the weapons program.

North Korea stated that it was open to discussing the situation with the United States. These discussions would embody another round of high level diplomatic contact between North Korea and the United States. The earlier round of discussions (noted in the paragraph above) were fraught with discord. Meanwhile, the United States insisted that the existence of a North Korean nuclear weapons program should be distinguished from the possible development of a nuclear weapons program in Iraq -- an issue that was gaining global media attention.

By November 2002, the United States and a number of its its allies agreed to stop the supply of fuel oil to North Korea. The United States and its allies explained that North Korea's recent admission of an ongoing nuclear weapons program constituted a breach of a 1994 agreement.

In a strange twist, however, South Korea then stated that it believed that North Korean's admission of a nuclear weapons program might, in fact, have been an erroneously translated statement. South Korean authorities noted that the interpretation of North Korea's radio transmission of issues regarding a nuclear weapons program may have been flawed. Specifically, South Korean authorities suggest that a verb used in the transmission may not have been clearly understood by monitors. That is to say, rather than stating that North Korea ""has come to have"" military counter-measures, including nuclear weapons, the key phrase was, in fact, that North Korea is simply ""entitled"" to own nuclear weapons. This ironic revelation gained credence when the wording in a new radio transmission was clearly changed to reflect the entitlement of a nuclear weapons program, rather than the actual ongoing development of one. Nevertheless, officials from news networks who cross-checked the South Korean claim of misinterpretation stated that the original translation was correct. Meanwhile, regional experts as well as International Relations specialists noted that North Korea's official media transmissions generally tend to be imbued by sharp rhetoric, even when the North Korean government  may be engaged with foreign entities. In this way, the hostile tone of the North Korean governmental megaphone might not necessarily have reflected the government's actual position on matters of international import. Yet other analysts suggested that North Korea's admission of a nuclear weapons program might have been a step in the direction of diplomacy. By responding to the United States' recent threats, the government in Pyongyang may have been signaling that it was open to discussion. Put simply, by declaring its nuclear weapons program, the government in Pyongyang may have been pushing the United States into some sort of negotiations. By the end of 2002, reports surfaced suggesting that North Korea had re-opened an old nuclear plant, despite strict warnings from both South Korea and the United States. A representative the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), as well as an official from the South Korean government, both reported that seals had been removed from the radiochemical laboratory in Yongbyon, which had been used for nuclear reprocessing. Experts observed that the Yongbyon plant has the facility to extract weapons-grade plutonium from spent fuel rods. For its part, North Korea claimed it had no choice but to resume its nuclear program since fuel oil supplies shipments had been halted in response to the United States' claims that it was in violation of a 1994 agreement. The North Koreans noted that they had to meet the energy needs of the country. The United States responded that the North Koreans were indulging in a circular argument; they also asserted that the re-opening of the old nuclear plant and nuclear program had nothing to do with energy generation.  The government of North Korea in Pyongyang stated it was willing to respond favorably to the security concerns of the United States, if a non-aggression treaty could be developed. This willingness again suggested that the North Koreans appeared to want to move in the direction of diplomatic discussions. The Bush administration in the United States, however, refused to negotiate with the North Koreans under these circumstances, although they moved closer in the direction of talks with North Korea. It remained unclear as to how the Bush administration distinguishes bilateral negotiations from talks or discussions.  Amidst a climate of political wrangling, two nuclear inspectors from the IAEA arrived in China on the last day of 2002, having been expelled from North Korea. The country's nuclear program was left unmonitored, although IAEA representatives expressed hopes that their inspectors would be allowed to return in due course. In another shocking development, North Korean officials hinted that the country would pull out of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in the near future, as a consequence of threats from the United States. The ""threats"" were thought to refer to a constellation of items, including the use of the term ""axis of evil"" by United States President George W. Bush in early 2002, the reportedly acrimonious bilateral discussions between United States envoy Kelly and North Korean officials, as well as the halt on fuel energy supplies to North Korea.

On Jan. 10, 2003, North Korean officials announced the country would withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. In a speech to the United Nations, the North Korean ambassador explained that the decision was indeed a consequence of United States' clearly expressed hostility toward North Korea. Pak Gil-yon, the North Korean ambassador, also referenced the Bush administration's inclusion of North Korea as part of an ""axis of evil"" in early 2002 as evidence of the United States' threatening stance against his country. In addition, he blamed the IAEA for acting as the pawn of the United States, in order to implement a policy hostile to North Korea.

The most promising development in regard to the brewing standoff between North Korea and the United States was a January 2003 meeting between North Korean officials and Bill Richardson, the governor of New Mexico. Richardson was the former Energy Secretary and Ambassador to the United Nations under United States President Bill Clinton.

In those meetings with Richardson, Deputy United Nations Ambassador, Han Song Ryol, reiterated North Korea's claim that it was not interested in building nuclear bombs, and that it wished to participate in nuclear verification. Richardson observed that these were positive developments that should be weighed against the North Korean withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Richardson, and other regional experts, observed that it has been customary for the North Koreans to make bellicose statements regarding the West, while simultaneously moving toward engagement. For this reason, Richardson urged bilateral dialogue between the United States and North Korea, despite the displays of North Korean brinkmanship. On Jan. 13, 2003, it was reported that if North Korea could resolve its nuclear weapons issue, the United States and other countries would offer energy assistance. United States envoy James Kelly did not comment on whether or not this incentive to North Korea constituted a shift in the Bush administration's policy. By mid-week, however, it was apparent that the United States was indeed signaling some interest in a compromise solution to the stand-off. Previously, the Bush administration had stated it would not reward or appease North Korea for abandoning its agreement to dismantle its nuclear weapons program. On Jan. 17, 2003, the government in Pyongyang dismissed the United States' offer of aid to North Korea -- in exchange for an end to its nuclear program -- as ""trickery"" and ""deceptive drama."" Instead, the officials in Pyongyang insisted that ""face to face"" bilateral negotiations were imperative, and a formal non-aggression agreement had to be established. By Jan. 20, 2003, United States Secretary of State Colin Powell expressed hope that the IAEA would refer the North Korean withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to the United Nations Security Council. Should the matter indeed be taken up by the international body's Security Council, however, the possibility of sanctions could ensue. North Korea had already indicated that the imposition of sanctions would be regarded as a declaration of war. Meanwhile, Russian envoy Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Losyukov met North Korean leader Kim Jong-il in an attempt to resolve the impasse between Washington and Pyongyang. Although Losyukov offered no details regarding his lengthy discussions with the North Korean leader, the talks were described as successful. The Russian plan to resolve the impasse provided security guarantees for North Korea, as well as an economic development and aid package, while also creating a nuclear-free Korean peninsula. Against this backdrop, United States Under-Secretary of State John Bolton headed to China to seek assistance from North Korea's ally, China, in resolving the situation.  In late January 2003, a South Korean national security adviser, Lim Dong-won, arrived in Pyongyang for diplomatic discussions aimed at resolving the conflict over North Korea's nuclear program.  South Korea's representative, Lim, who happened to be a former unification minister, cautioned that while his efforts would be aimed at averting a war, there was no easy or quick resolution at hand. Instead, Lim observed that his job would be to create a foundation for dialogue, and eventually, the peaceful resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue.  North Korea's willingness to accept mediation from other countries, such as South Korea, was considered to be a productive development in an otherwise grim situation. Previously, the North Korean government had said that it would only accept direct negotiations with the United States government. For its part, the United States government refused direct negotiations with North Korea, but later, shifted its stance and agreed to ""talks.""  Meanwhile, the IAEA said it would convene an emergency session in early February 2003 to discuss the nuclear issue in North Korea. In those meetings, it would decide whether or not to refer the nuclear issue to the United Nations Security Council. Thus far, the North Koreans had been adamantly opposed to United Nations actions in regard to their nuclear program, and warned that the establishment of United Nations' sanctions against North Korea would be regarded as a declaration of war. Complicating matters was the United States' claim that recently recorded satellite imagery showed trucks at the North Korean nuclear complex at Yongbyon being loaded with unspecified materials. The finding suggested that North Korea was pursuing its nuclear ambitions in the midst of increasing tensions.  Contributing to rising tensions was a missile test by North Korea. Just before the new President of South Korea was inaugurated, Pyongyang fired a missile into the sea between Japan and the Korean peninsula. The missile was reported to be a short range land-to-ship missile which fell 36 miles or 60 kilometers from the Korean peninsula. While South Korea's incoming President Roh made no mention of the missile test during his inauguration, he did call upon North Korea to step away from its nuclear program. Roh expressed the desire to resolve tensions on the Korean peninsula peacefully and criticized the United States' rhetoric in regard to the North.  In March 2003, North Korea test-fired another missile into the sea off its coast. The United States announced that there were signs suggesting another missile launch was imminent. As such, ships were warned to stay away from the targeted area of the Sea of Japan (also known as the East Sea). The missile test followed another refusal by Washington to hold direct talks with Pyongyang, for the purpose of resolving the brewing conflict.  Then, reports emerged suggesting that North Korea intended to test fire another missile in the near future. This longer range Rodong ballistic missile could reach any part of Japan. As such, Japan threatened to impose economic sanctions on North Korea if such a ballistic missile was, indeed, tested. Sanctions would include a halt in cash transfers and several hundred millions in exports. Japan has since stepped up surveillance patrols near the Korean Peninsula.  Meanwhile, the United States air force resumed reconnaissance flights in international airspace close to North Korea. This resumption came on the heels of a United States aircraft being intercepted by North Korean fighter jets in late February 2003.

Both former United States Secretary of State Colin Powell and former National Security Advisor Condoleeza Rice repeatedly stated that while they were not against multilateral discussions, direct bilateral negotiations were not likely. As well, Washington expressed no plans to establish new agreements or treaties with Pyongyang, including North Korea's repeated request for a non-aggression treaty.

In March 2003, North Korea's nuclear program had been referred to the United Nations Security Council when the country expelled the United Nations nuclear inspectors. The head of the IAEA, Mohammed El Baradei, stated that nuclear inspectors should return to North Korea and the international community should send a consistent message regarding the prohibition of nuclear weapons. The government of North Korea said that discussions of its country's nuclear program in the United Nations Security Council would be regarded as both a provocative act and a prelude to war. Officials in Pyongyang also promised to strengthen the country's military forces and weaponry, noting that only strong military deterrence could protect its nation security and prevent United States aggression.

At that time, the North Korean government observed that the United States-led war against Iraq had demonstrated how disarmament via inspections had not prevented military action from taking place. In light of the United Nation's failure to prevent a war with Iraq, Pyongyang said it would ignore any resolution that emerged from the Security Council meetings. Officials in Pyongyang ominously observed that it was hardly likely that a non-aggression treaty with the United States could resolve the issue of the country's nuclear program peacefully.

In April 2003, delegations from the United States and North Korea arrived in Beijing, China, for the first face-to-face discussions in several months since the confrontation erupted in 2002. The North Korean government surprisingly announced it wished to pursue multilateral diplomatic talks in regard to its nuclear program. The announcement was made during an interview with a Foreign Ministry official on the state-controlled official news service. The government in Pyongyang had insisted for several months on direct bilateral talks with the United States. This reversal was viewed as a significant opening in the impasse surrounding the North Korean nuclear program. The decision to pursue multilateral talks effectively softened the stance of the North Korean government. The government of South Korea expressed the view that the shift was a result of fear and intimidation produced by the military war against Iraq. Other observers, however, believed that the government of Kim Jong-il wanted to present a more reasonable position internationally. Still others suggested that the softened stance was intended to ""buy time,"" in much the same way as the Soviet leadership would propose talks when its influence was threatened during the Soviet era. Finally, political scientists expressed the belief that intensified pressure by the Chinese produced the concession. The discussions were scheduled to last for three days and were led by United States Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian affairs, James Kelly, and North Korea's American Affairs Bureau Chief, Li Gun. The role of China in the discussions remained unclear. The United States insisted that China was another third party within the context of multilateral talks, while North Korea described China as simply the host country. Former United States Secretary of State, Colin Powell, described the talks as ""useful."" For its part, Pyongyang offered to abandon its nuclear weapons program in exchange for a package of political and economic benefits by the United States. Political benefits would include the normalization of bilateral relations, while economic benefits would include financial aid. The discussions were not likely change the position of the United States that North Korea must abandon its nuclear program and agree to verification of the process. For its part, although North Korea offered to dismantle its nuclear program in lieu of various rewards (intimated above), officials in Pyongyang stated they would not allow United Nations' verification of nuclear program abandonment. The United States said it would ""study"" North Korea's proposals. Meanwhile, intelligence reports as well as the North Korean state news agency, disclosed findings that North Korea was successfully reprocessing 8,000 spent fuel rods. Such fuel rods would be used in the production of weapons-grade plutonium. Another report by the IAEA claimed that North Korea had the capability to produce nuclear weapons and, indeed, might already possess such weaponry.  In May 2003, North Korea announced it would be withdrawing from a 1992 agreement with its neighbor to the south which pledged to keep the Korean peninsula free of nuclear weaponry. Pyongyang said that its reason for withdrawing from the agreement with South Korea was due to ""the sinister and hostile"" policy of the United States toward North Korea. This announcement preceded impending talks between the leadership of South Korea and the United States, which would focus on the nuclear ambitions of North Korea.  In August 2003, North Korea agreed to multilateral talks, which would include the countries in the region of East Asia as well as the United States. The talks were to take place in Beijing, China. The talks would include North Korea, the United States, China, South Korea, Japan and Russia. The North Korean official news agency said that ""the forthcoming talks would clearly show the world community whether or not the United States had a true willingness to make a switchover in its policy toward the DPRK [North Korea]."" Pyongyang said that a change in United States policy to North Korea would be essential in resolving the nuclear crisis. Tensions between the United States and North Korea intensified when North Korea's disclosed that it already had produced nuclear bombs and was prepared to produce more.  Ahead of the multilateral talks, North Korea ratcheted up its rhetoric by referring to South Korea as a ""dangerous place"" and canceling its plans to take part in the World University Games in Daegu, South Korea. Meanwhile, South Korean warships again fired warning shots at a North Korean vessel which broached South Korean territory. Complicating matters was the decision by South Korea and the United States to carry out its annual joint war games on the peninsula. Pyongyang objected to these activities saying that they were akin to a rehearsal for a preemptive attack against the North. The North Korean news agency carried a report warning that if the United States failed to shift its current policy on North Korea, then Pyongyang would reaffirm its commitment to a nuclear program.  The talks in Beijing in August resulted in a brash declaration by Pyongyang that they had been a waste of time. Soon thereafter, however, Pyongyang softened its stance. No resolution was produced as a result of the meeting.In October 2003, the North Korean government announced it had reprocessed 8,000 spent nuclear fuel rods and said it was now able to use the plutonium extracted from the rods for weapons purposes. The announcement also included the claim that North Korea would reprocess more spent fuel from the nuclear reactor in Yongbyon. Although the resumption of nuclear activities had been for ""peaceful purposes,"" the government statement noted that since the deterioration of relations with the United States, that purpose had changed. This admission by North Korea came only weeks after multilateral talks (mentioned above) in Beijing. North Korea then said it had no interest in further talks.By 2004, the IAEA  said it was investigating reports that North Korea made clandestine sales of uranium to Libya at a time when that country was attempting to develop nuclear weapons. A report in the New York Times stated that the IAEA uncovered evidence that Pyongyang had provided Tripoli with nearly two tons of uranium in 2001. The New York Times report also noted that the uranium sent to Libya could not have been used as nuclear fuel unless it was enriched in centrifuges.  The report went on to state that Libya had been constructing centrifuges and had a plan to purchase equipment from a black-market network run by Pakistan's former nuclear chief, Abdul Qadeer Khan, who admitted to selling nuclear secrets to Libya, Iran and North Korea. In this regard, the IAEA said it planned investigations on the basis of evidence that emerges from interviews with former members of Khan's network.  Meanwhile, intelligence agencies were reportedly attempting to determine if North Korea carried out any other secret deals with other countries or groups.In September 2004, North Korea insisted it would never dismantle its nuclear program while the United States maintained a ""hostile"" policy toward the country.  Earlier, North Korea had suspended six-nation talks to protest South Korean violations of nuclear accords.In early 2005, the Chinese government assured newly-appointed United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice that it would push multi-party talks with North Korea, which would be aimed at ending the nuclear crisis on the Korean peninsula.  For its part, however, North Korea said it has no interest in re-entering such talks, which stalled in 2003.By May 2005, Mohammed El Baradei, the head of the United Nations nuclear watchdog group -- the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) -- said that North Korea could potentially have as many as six  nuclear weapons. The IAEA chief also said that the North Koreans had the industrial infrastructure  to weaponize the plutonium in their possession.  His statement came amidst reports that North Korea might be preparing to test a nuclear bomb.Only a week earlier, the United States and Japan said they were investigating reports that North Korea had test-fired a short-range missile into the Sea of Japan.  Public broadcasts from Japan noted that the missile may have flown 62 miles (about 100 kilometers) into the sea. Japanese authorities had been on alert since warnings emerged that North Korea might test a nuclear warhead and following the withdrawal of the North Koreans from multilateral nuclear talks.Amidst this development, North Korea and the United States indulged in a war of words.  United States President George W. Bush called North Korean leader Kim Jung-il ""a tyrannical dictator"" in his April press conference, while President Kim Jung-il referred to Bush as a ""Philistine"" and ""half baked man."" (CountryWatch's Editor does not endorse these characterizations. Editor simply reports that which is within the public record.)Following a meeting with South Korean officials in June 2005, North Korean leader Kim Jong-il said that Pyongyang might return to international talks related to its nuclear proliferation program.  He added that Pyongyang might be prepared to resume the six-party talks which had been suspended a year ago as early as July 2005.  Kim Jong-il noted that North Korean participation would be contingent on respectful treatment by the United States as an ""equal"" dialogue partner.  He also hinted at the need for further consultations between Pyongyang and Washington.Despite these assertions, movement toward a return to multilateral talks were progressing.In  July 2005, ahead of the anticipated resumption of multilateral talks on nuclear weaponry, North Korea called for a peace treaty with the United States.  In an official statement, Pyongyang said that in order to resolve the current nuclear crisis, a full treaty was needed to replace the armistice signed at the end of the Korean War in 1953. In effect, a formalization of peace would replace the cease-fire and lead to the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. Pyongyang has made similar calls previously, and more recently, it has demanded a non-aggression pact with the United States.  Washington rejected the idea of a non-aggression pact stating that it would not deal with Pyongyang until its nuclear weapons program was shut down. For its part, Pyongyang accused Washington of hostility.  Indeed, North Korea has said its nuclear weaponry is needed as a form of protection against American aggression.By August 2005, the issue of nuclear proliferation on the Korean peninsula continued to dominate the political landscape. Talks between North Korea and the United States had met with little success, with no narrowing of the gap between those two countries on North Korea's peaceful use of nuclear energy.  The United States continued to insist that all of North Korea's nuclear facilities had to be dismantled while North Koreans insisted that they had the right to conduct peaceful nuclear activities.  Indeed,  North Korean chief delegate Kim Kye-gwan rhetorically asked, ""We are not a defeated nation in war, and we have committed no crime, so why should we not be able to conduct peaceful nuclear activities?""Note: The meeting took place within the context of the resumption of multilateral talks, of which South Korea had been a part.  As noted previously, multilateral talks, which began in 2003 following North Korea's 2002 withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, had stalled some time later when North Korea walked away from the negotiating table to the chagrin of the other meeting partners, most especially South Korea. The multilateral talks resumed again in 2005, but with little progress being made by mid-year.In response to the insistence by the United States that North Korea relinquish its nuclear programs before receiving any concessions, Pyongyang in the first part of September 2005 said it would continue its nuclear development activities.  Despite suggestions by United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice that Washington was running out of patience with Pyongyang, negotiators in China attempted to form a compromise agreement.  In this regard, Beijing proposed a revised draft agreement which affirmed Pyongyang's right to civilian nuclear technology. While there was no immediate feedback from either Washington or Pyongyang on the proposal at the time, Pyongyang had already rejected an offer by the South Korean authorities in Seoul to provide economic aid, security guarantees, diplomatic recognition and energy aid.  Instead, Pyongyang steadfastly maintained its requirement for  a light-water nuclear reactor for generating power in exchange for dismantling its nuclear weapons program.On Sept.19, 2005, North Korea announced that it was relinquishing its  nuclear activities and would rejoin the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Pyongyang also agreed to accept inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the nuclear watchdog agency of the United Nations. The announcement of the breakthrough was made by negotiators in Beijing during six-party talks. In exchange for Pyongyang's agreement to stop its nuclear activities, it was reported that the United States had to offer assurances that it would not attack or invade North Korea.  The United States also made clear that it had no nuclear weaponry on the Korean peninsula.  Wu Dawei, China's vice foreign minister, said, ""This is the most important result since the six-party talks started more than two years ago."" Left outside the agreement were a number of unresolved issues including the aforementioned matter of Pyongyang's request for a  light water nuclear reactor.  While the announcement was welcomed, observers  warned that implementation of the agreement could result in a host of  challenges.  Indeed, there was little actual progress reported following announcement of the deal.  In fact, a day later, North Korea said it would only comply with the agreement if it was provided with a civilian reactor.  Soon thereafter, the United States imposed financial sanctions on North Korean businesses. 

The 2006 Nuclear Test and Consequences    

In mid-June 2006, reports emerged that North Korea intended to test a weapon that could reach the United States.  On June 19, 2006, the Bush administration in the United States said that North Korea had completed the loading of fuel into a long-range ballistic missile. Intelligence sources suggested that the type of missile might be the Taepodong-2 with a firing range of 9,300 miles, however, there was no confirmation on this particular point.White House spokesman Tony Snow said, ""North Korea has imposed a moratorium on launching missiles.""  Referring to a previous commitment made by North Korea to dismantle its nuclear weapons and stop further development, Snow also said,  ""We hope it will continue that moratorium and we hope it also will abide by commitments it made.""  The White House provided little further comment, however, Snow did acknowledge that the United States had held some direct talks with North Korean representatives in New York, presumably via North Korea's United Nations mission.Several countries warned North Korea that launching a missile would yield undesirable results.  Notably, Japanese Prime Minister  Junichiro Koizumi advised North Korea against test-firing the missile saying, ""Japan has been urging North Korea to stop the attempt to launch a missile. We are making efforts to urge North Korea to act rationally and with self-restraint.""  He went on to warn, ""If it does not listen to us and fires a missile, we have to consult with the United States and take stern measures.""  While the actual consequences were not specified, some officials noted that the Japanese leader was referring to a protest to the United Nations Security Council.For its part, North Korea referred to its missile program for the first time on June 19, 2006.  Absent from its reference, however, was any mention of intent to actually perform the missile test.  Monitoring of North Korean state media led to reports that an editorial had been cited in which the North declared its right to own a missile that could ""immediately halt the United States' reckless aerial espionage activity.""  The citation was believed to have been a reference to allegations regarding United States spy planes in Korean territory.An actual missile test would mark North Korea's first major launch since 1998 when it sent a missile over Japanese territory. Since then, Pyongyang has stood by a self-imposed test moratorium even as it separately developed a nuclear weapons program.  More recently, North Korea said that it required a nuclear weapons program as well as a delivery system for the purpose of countering a potential invasion by the United States.In the early hours of July 5, 2006, North Korea test-fired a number of missiles.  Most of the missiles were of the short-range variety.  Among those fired, however, was also the Taepodong-2 long-range missile, which experts  said has a possible range of 2,190 to 2,690 miles (3,500 to 4,300 kilometers). All of the short-range missiles fell safely into the Sea of Japan (also known as the East Sea by Koreans).  The first of the missiles fell into the sea less than 400 miles (approximately 600 kilometers) from the Japanese mainland. The Taepodong-2 long-range missile, which has the capacity to reach Alaska in the United States, crashed approximately 40 seconds after it was launched.  This outcome did little to alleviate anxieties among the international community about North Korea's latest move.In response, the United Nations Security Council said that it would convene an emergency meeting later in the day  to consider the missile tests.  The closed session meeting was requested by Kenzo Oshima,  Japan's ambassador to the United Nations.Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Shinzo Abe condemned the move by North Korea saying, ""This is a grave problem in terms of peace and stability not only of Japan but also of international society.""  As a result, Japan announced that it was prohibiting  the entry of officials, chartered flights and ferries from North Korea. Also, Japan's Foreign Minister Taro Aso warned that Tokyo was now considering the imposition of economic sanctions on North Korea.The last time North Korea test-fired a long-range missile was 1998 when it launched the Taepondong-1 over Japan. Then, in 2002, North Korea forged a concord with Japan by which both parties agreed to a moratorium on missile tests.  It was an agreement that was reaffirmed in 2004, but which has now been effectively abrogated as a result of North Korea's latest actions.In South Korea, the government in Seoul convened an emergency cabinet meeting and placed its military on high alert.China expressed strong concern about North Korea's actions and called on the international community to stay calm.The United States Department of State reacted to the situation by characterizing the launch of the Taepodon-2 as a ""provocative"" and attention-seeking act.  White House press secretary, Tony Snow, said that President George W. Bush was consulting with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld on the matter.  Secretary Rice called on North Korea to return to the multilateral discussion table.For its part, North Korea confirmed that it had test-fired a series of missiles and that further missile tests would be launched.  North Korean officials also warned that they would react strongly to punitive pressures from the international community. Furthermore, North Korea defiantly defended its right to launch the missiles, saying that it was a matter of national sovereignty.  That said, geopolitical analysts observed that North Korea's latest moves may have been made for strategic reasons rather than simply as an act of national sovereignty.North Korea may well have decided to launch the missiles in order to draw attention to its demands regarding its nuclear program.  Multilateral negotiations (mentioned above) have seen little progress since the talks stalled in 2005.  As well, relations between Pyongyang and Washington D.C. have remained poor.Tensions between the United States and North Korea may well have factored into the decision by Pyongyang to launch the missiles.  Indeed, two days prior on July 3, 2006, North Korea warned that it would carry out an ""annihilating"" nuclear strike if its atomic facilities were pre-emptively hit by the United States.  While the United States dismissed the threat by North Korea as hypothetical, North Korea's ominous warning nonetheless evoked the notion of brinksmanship. As intimated above, experts have often surmised that the North Koreans tend to stake out radical stances in order to push for engagement.Rather than engagement, however, North Korea was more likely to face international action. In fact, Japan was said to be drafting a resolution in response to its decision to test-fire several missiles, including the long-range Taepodong-2 variety.While most of the members of the international community were unified in their condemnation of the test-firing of the missiles by North Korea, not everyone was in agreement about how to respond.  A draft resolution by Japan was backed by the United States and the United Kingdom but did not receive unanimous support.The reticence among some countries to support the Japanese draft  was likely due to some of its particular provisions. The Japanese draft resolution's less controversial elements included a demand that countries prevent the transfer of resources and technology that could help with the development of North Korea's missile program. But the draft also characterized North Korea as a ""threat to international peace and security"" and invoked Chapter Seven of the United Nations charter.  Resolutions crafted under the aegis of Chapter Seven are legally binding and have the authority to impose not only economic sanctions, but also military action.China and Russia both said that they opposed punitive measures, preferring the route of diplomacy instead.  China said that a statement condemning the missiles tests would be appropriate while sanctions would not.  China also said that the Japanese draft was an ""over-reaction"" and warned that it would ""increase tension."" China was playing  host during a visit from North Korean officials in July 2006.  During that visit, Chinese President Hu Jintao made clear that China was opposed to any actions that might ""worsen the situation on the Korean peninsula."" For his part, Russian President Vladimir Putin also warned that ""common sense"" should not be abandoned.  He pointed to the fact that North Korea's current level of technology would make it impossible for a missile with a range of around 3,700 miles (6,000 kilometers) to be constructed.  As well, South Korea reacted with anxiety to the Japanese proposal, even going so far as to accuse Japan of recklessness.The positions taken by Russia and China, both of whom hold veto power at the United Nations Security Council, suggested that they would wield that influence to oppose any moves they deemed to be unconstructive or inflammatory. Instead it was believed that both countries would be more likely to back a non-binding statement by the Security Council, which demanded that North Korea cease the development and testing of ballistic missiles.It was a proposal not likely to be supported by the United Kingdom and United States because of its lack of legal accountability.Nevertheless, diplomatic efforts continued in the hopes that a solution might be presented. To this end, the members of the Security Council agreed to postpone voting on strong sanctions until China had been given an opportunity to broker some sort of resolution to the crisis. July 2006 also saw  United States  envoy to North Korea, Christopher Hill, convening talks in Beijing, while a North Korean delegation was visiting Seoul.In mid-July 2006, the United Nations condemned North Korea for carrying out a series of missile tests earlier in the month. The United Nations Security Council also issued a resolution demanding that North Korea cease activities related to its ballistic missile program and prohibiting all United Nations member states from supplying that country with any weapons-related materials.  The resolution passed unanimously after a reference to Chapter Seven of the United Nations Charter was removed.  That reference would authorize sanctions and military action and would be legally binding.  Its removal ensured that there would be complete support from among Security Council members. 

Both the United States and the United Kingdom expressed approval for the strong message ensconced in the resolution. Japan's Foreign Minister, Taro Aso, applauded the Security Council for its quick response. South Korea called on the North to issue a moratorium on missile tests and return to the multilateral negotiating table. For its part, however, North Korea angrily rejected the resolution and vowed to further develop its military arsenal as a means to ""bolster its war deterrent."" North Korea also characterized the resolution as being the result of hostile United States policy and vowed not to be bound by it.       

In the first week of October 2006, North Korea said that it intended to test  a nuclear weapon.  In response, the United Nations Security Council issued a statement noting that a nuclear test would ""jeopardize peace, stability and security in the region and beyond"" and ""bring universal condemnation by the international community.""

A week after issuing its threat and receiving the aforementioned warning from the United Nations, North Korea announced on October 9, 2006 that it had indeed conducted its first nuclear weapons test.  North Korea's state-controlled news agency declared,  ""The nuclear test is a historic event that brought happiness to our military and people.""  The message in the state-controlled media also went on to assert that the nuclear test would, ""contribute to maintaining peace and stability in the Korean peninsula and surrounding region"" -- a diametrically opposed view to the perspective depicted by the United Nations. The state-controlled news agency also said that the successful nuclear test, which utilized local technology, had taken place at an underground facility and had not resulted in any radiation leaks.

While there was no immediate verification of North Korea's claim, officials from South Korea said that an explosion measuring 3.5 on the Richter scale had been detected and appeared to have come from the north-eastern part of North Korea.  The South Korean news agency, Yonhap, suggested that the explosion may have occurred in an area called Gilju in North Korea's Hamgyong province.  Whether or not the explosion was derived from an actual nuclear event, however, was yet to be determined.

The apparent test took place in defiance of warnings by the international community not to go through with the test.  In response, South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun scheduled an emergency meeting of his National Security Council.  The meeting was convened to address the serious shift in the security scenario on the Korean peninsula.  Only  days before, South Korean troops fired warning shots at North Korean soldiers when they crossed into the demilitarized zone.  It was not clear whether the North Koreans' actions were calculated or accidental.  Regardless, they were emblematic of the increasing climate of tension on the Korean peninsula, which reached an unprecedented high following the apparent nuclear test.

Meanwhile, Japan's new head of government, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, was expected to discuss the matter with his South Korean counterpart in Seoul.  Prime Minister Abe and Chinese Premier Hu Jintao had previously met in Beijing to discuss regional concerns and had jointly issued their opposition to the notion of a nuclear test by North Korea.  Clearly, their joint statement went unheeded by Pyongyang.

Some analysts have surmised that Pyongyang's actions of this period  -- the missile tests in July and this nuclear test three months later -- may be due to feelings that it has nothing to lose.  That is to say, as noted above North Korea said in 2005  that it was willing to give up its nuclear activities, and a day later said it would only do so if it was provided with a civilian reactor.  At that time, the United States imposed financial sanctions on North Korean businesses.  Thus, it has been theorized that North Korea feels as if it has no choice but to ""up the ante"" in order to have its interests considered.

Regardless of motivation, the effects of the nuclear test augured negatively.  Apart from destabilizing the region, analysts warned that it could potentially halt any progress on reconciliation between the two Koreas, and it could well spark an arms race.   A day later, attention shifted to the consequences of North Korea's claim that it carried out a nuclear test.  In particular, the United Nations Security Council was debating  what action should be taken.   At issue was a proposal by the United States that would entail the imposition of strict sanctions against North Korea.  That 13-point draft resolution called for the sanctions to be implemented under the aegis of Chapter Seven of the United Nations Charter, which would make the conditions mandatory and enforceable via military means.  Those sanctions would include a complete prohibition of military trade and careful inspection of all cargo departing and entering North Korea. Underscoring this hardline stance,  John Bolton, the United States ambassador to the United Nations,  said that his country would not rule out force although it hoped to resolve the matter through diplomacy.    It was yet to be seen if such a course of action would be acceptable to other United Nations Security Council members.  Despite its alliance with North Korea, China called for punitive action  in the face of the apparent nuclear test.  That said, China made it clear that it would not support the use of force.  Russia's position very much reflected that of China.  In this way, the Chapter Seven elements within the United States draft resolution promised to be a obstacle to any agreement forged within the United Nations Security Council.   With China and Russia unlikely to vote for the resolution in its original form, the United States  revised the text, essentially expunging the threat of imminent military action.  A vote was expected in the United Nations Security Council on October 14, 2006.   

The draft document by the United States soon underwent revisions to accommodate the reservations of China and Russia.With adjustments made, the United Nations Security Council unanimously approved Resolution 1718 on October 14, 2006.  The resolution called for  the inspections on cargo going to and from North Korea to search for weapons, a ban on the sale or transfer of materials related to North Korea's unconventional weapons program, and a freeze on the transfer of funds connected with North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.  Absent from Resolution 1718 was the Chapter Seven [of the United Nations charter] provision, which would enforce the sanctions via military force.Even though the resolution was approved by  the United Nations Security Council and welcomed by the international community, total agreement on the matter of North Korea remained distant.  China announced that it retained ""reservations"" about the notion of cargo inspections while Russia said that it did not expect the sanctions to be imposed indefinitely. At issue for both China and Russia has been their shared concern that cargo inspections could spark naval confrontations with North Korean shipping vessels, thus spurring further regional destabilization.Meanwhile, South Korea welcomed the new sanctions and called on North Korea to return to the negotiating table for multilateral talks.  Japan also welcomed the new sanctions, which came days after the new administration of Shinzo Abe had instituted unilateral sanctions against North Korea, essentially banning all North Korean imports and preventing North Korean vessels from entering Japanese waters.  For his part, United States President George W. Bush applauded the United Nations for taking ""swift and tough"" measures against North Korea, in order to keep the Korean Peninsula secure.As expected, the North Korean government in Pyongyang had a different view.  It decried Resolution 1718, characterized the membership of the United Nations Security Council as ""gangsters,"" and warned that subsequent pressure by the United States would be regarded as  ""a declaration of war.""In the aftermath of North Korea's apparent nuclear test, diplomatic efforts were underway to resolve the situation and to return all parties to the negotiating table for talks.  At issue was the question of whether or not North Korea might defy the will of the international community again and test another nuclear device.

There were media reports suggesting that the North Korean government was moving in a direction regarded as more amenable to the international community.  Indeed, some reports intimated that the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-il, expressed regret for the nuclear test. Other reports indicated that Kim Jong-il had given assurances to Chinese envoy, Tang Jiaxuan, that there would be no further nuclear tests.  Kyodo, the Japanese news agency, even reported that the North Korean leader said that he wished to honor the 1992 declaration, which aimed at ending nuclear proliferation on the Korean peninsula.    

The United States, however, did not quickly accept this version of events.  On her return trip from her Asian tour, United States Secretary of State , Condoleezza Rice, said that she knew nothing about these developments and expressed the view that North Korea demonstrated little desire to resolve the matter.  According to British media (BBC), Rice said, ""Tang did not tell me that Kim Jong-il either apologized for the test or said that he would not ever test again."" She went on the note, ""The Chinese did not, in a fairly thorough briefing to me, say anything about an apology. The North Koreans, I think, would like to see an escalation of the tension.""Editor's Note: The nuclear test and earlier missile tests intensified the widely-held view that North Korea was a threat to global security. Moreover, these moves by North Korea effectively served to further isolate the country and confirm its pariah status within the international community.

A Return to Diplomacy? Late 2006-2007

December 2006 marked the resumption of multilateral talks regarding North Korea's controversial nuclear program.  North Korea, South Korea, China, Japan, Russia and the United States indicated their return to the negotiating table after a year-long hiatus. The re-opening of dialogue came a few months after North Korea caused global anxiety when it tested a nuclear weapon.  That incident resulted in international condemnation, and ultimately prompted the imposition of sanctions against North Korea by the United Nations.  While the news of the recommencement of  six-party talks was welcomed, there was also a pervasive sense of caution. Experts conveyed limited optimism about the prospects of forging a resolution amenable to all parties. Indeed, the United States has consistently expressed vociferous opposition to the notion of North Korea being a nuclear power, while North Korea has been equally adamant about its need for nuclear weapons.  These two absolutist positions have resulted in an impasse.

In preliminary talks with his Chinese and South Korean cohorts in the Chinese capital of Beijing, United States Envoy Christopher Hill expressly stated that he believed Pyonyang had a clear choice to make.  To this end, he said, ""We can either go forward on a diplomatic track or you have to go to a much more difficult track. That is a track that involves sanctions and I think ultimately will really be very harmful to the economy.""

This view from Washington, however, was not likely to resonate particularly well with Pyongyang.  First, North Korean Envoy Kim Kye-gwan made it clear that his country required nuclear weaponry for deterrent purposes.  Second, he expressed the view that the problem was not rooted in North Korea's nuclear program itself, but rather, it stemmed from the hostile stance of the United States toward North Korea.  He said, ""The biggest problem is that the United States needs to change its hostile policy against North Korea. When they change their policy from a hostile stance to one of peaceful co-existence, the problem can be resolved.""

The clear disconnection between the two perspectives on the eve of the resumption of multilateral talks augured grave difficulties during the negotiating process. In fact, it suggested that concurrence was not likely to be found easily.  Nevertheless, the return of all parties to the table for dialogue presented a new opportunity to find creative solutions.  For example, despite the hardline positions referenced above,  there have been some suggestions  that the United States might be willing to consider easing the financial component of the existing sanctions.  Such a move could pave the way for decreased intransigence by North Korea.  As well, there were hopes that an earlier offer by the United States of a security guarantee could be used as the foundation for forthcoming negotiations.  That arrangement offered North Korea a security guarantee in exchange for the cessation of its nuclear program.  In actuality, the December 2006 talks ended inconclusively.A month later in January 2007,  it was announced that six-party talks on North Korea's nuclear program would resume.In the background of such developments was the  aforementioned testing of a nuclear device by North Korea in the fall of 2006.  That action did little to bolster Pyongyang's case for its right to a nuclear program, and overshadowed prevailing hopes that North Korea might abandon its nuclear ambitions and rejoin the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in exchange for economic aid and security guarantees.

The situation was made more complex as a result of a financial dispute involving North Korea and the United States (U.S). At issue was the 2005 decision by the U.S. to take action against a private bank in the Chinese domain of Macao on the basis of North Korean money laundering.  Fearing consequences of the same sort, several  other banks refrained from doing business with North Korea as well.  Now with the international community urging progress on the nuclear issue, North Korea was hoping to link resolution of the financial dispute with whatever agreement could be forged.By February 2007, the multilateral discussions commenced in China between all six parties -- North Korea, South Korea, China, Japan, the United States, and Russia.  Progress was quickly made during the six-party talks in Beijing when North Korea agreed to move closer toward the position of disarmament.  Of particular interest was an agreement  reportedly requiring Pyongyang to shut down its nuclear facilities  at Yongbyon over the course of the ensuing months, in lieu of aid, such as fuel oil provided by the United States and South Korea.  The draft agreement, which had been drafted by Chinese,  also called for the return of international inspectors to North Korea.

No concurrence was yet forged days after talks began. Nevertheless, spokespersons from the United States and North Korea refrained from harsh rhetoric, and instead commented on the work yet to be accomplished. Notably, United States delegate, Christopher Hill, struck a note of cautious optimism saying in an interview with Agence France Presse, ""I think we have managed to get through what we thought were tough issues but nothing is agreed until everything is agreed so we must be very cautious.""  Along a similar vein, North Korean delegate, Kim Kye-gwan, said ""There are still differences on a series of issues in the overall talks, so we will try to work them out.""

The shift in tone on the parts of both the United States and North Korea demonstrated a sharp contrast to dynamics of the previous several years.  The United States demonstrated greater willingness for dialogue during meetings in Berlin, which preceded the Beijing multilateral talks. Meanwhile, North Korea has been facing a massive food crisis in the winter months -- a scenario  that may have also contributed to the more productive dynamics in 2007. By February 13, 2007, it was announced that concurrence had been reached.  As noted above, North Korea agreed to shut down its nuclear facilities at Yongbyon within 60 days in exchange for 50,000 tonnes of fuel oil or economic aid of equal value, with 950,000 tonnes of fuel oil or equivalent received after further disarmament steps are taken.As well, both Japan and the United States agreed to discuss the possibility of normalizing ties with North Korea -- something that Pyongyang has been seeking for some time.The United States also said that it would work with North Korea to resolve the banking dispute discussed above, and it would consider the prospects of removing North Korea from its list of state sponsors of terrorism. United States President George W. Bush said that the deal represented ""the best opportunity to use diplomacy to address North Korea's nuclear programs.""  In his official statement, he also stated that the agreement was emblematic of ""the common commitment of the participants to a Korean Peninsula that is free of nuclear weapons."" Yet to be seen was whether or not the agreement would be ratified by all six parties, and also whether or not North Korea would fully comply with the provisions of the deal.  For example, the state news agency of North Korea issued a report referring to the ""temporary"" suspension of nuclear activities, rather than enduring disarmament.  United States negotiator, Christopher Hill, warned that the resumption of nuclear activities in the future would be a clear violation of the agreement.  In the third week of June 2007, North Korea reportedly agreed to shut down its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon and, then, disable its nuclear facilities.  North Korea also noted that it was inviting International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors to return to North Korea to monitor the closure of its nuclear program and facilities.  To that end, IAEA inspectors were expected to visit North Korea on June 26, 2007, for the first time since their dismissal from that country in 2002.

These announcements came months after the Chinese drafted an agreement in February 2007 (as noted above), in which the closure of the reactor at Yongbyon would be secured, in lieu of heavy fuel oil that would be secured by other countries (noted below) participating in the multilateral nuclear disarmament talks.The total amount of fuel oil -- one million metric tons -- appeared to more substantial that the original quantity discussed earlier in the year under the Chinese-brokered plan.  In addition, diplomatic recognition and humanitarian aid benefits were included in the deal.  Also included in the arrangement was the untangling of aforementioned financial dispute.With the deal now moving forward, North Korea said that it would begin the process of shutting down operations at Yongbyon within weeks, pending receipt of the frozen funds. Russia, which worked to facilitate the complex transfer, said that the money was in the process of being delivered.

North Korea characterized talks with United States nuclear envoy, Christopher Hill, on these matter as being both  ""comprehensive and productive.""  Hill responded to the developments positively but noted that the closure of the reactor at Yongbyon was only the start of an ongoing process, and would not solve all the problems at hand. Hill also said that a new round of six-party disarmament talks, which has included North Korea, South Korea, China, Japan, Russia and the United States, would commence in July 2007.In mid-July 2007, North Korea said that it shut down its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon.  A team of inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was monitoring the situation at Yongbyon in order to verify Pyongyang's claim.  Nevertheless, the announcement was welcomed by the countries of the West, the wider world, and particularly by the countries participating in multilateral talks with North Korea aimed at disarmament. In October 2007, South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun and the North Korea's leader Kim Jong-ilsigned a joint declaration calling for a permanent peace agreement on the Korean Peninsula.The eight-point declaration set forth an agenda for international dialogue aimed at crafting a treaty, which would replace the existing armistice that brought an end to the Korean War that took place from 1950 to 1953.  The two Korean leaders signed the declaration following a historic summit in Pyongyang and issued the following statement, ""The South and North share the view that they should end the current armistice system and build up a permanent peace system.""

The declaration also came on the heels of a significant announcement by North Korea that it would end its nuclear ambitions.  To that end, Pyongyang formally agreed to a timetable for the disabling of its nuclear facilities.Pyongyang also agreed to disclose details about its nuclear program by the close of 2007. North Korea has additionally been scheduled to surrender its stockpile of nuclear weaponry in 2008.

A Return to Defiance and Provocation 2008 - 2009 In March 2008, North Korea was reported to have rest fired several short range missiles from its western coast into the Yellow Sea.  The Yonhap news agency reported  that the missiles were Russian-designed Styx ship-to-ship missiles with a range of  29 miles or 46 kilometers.  For its part, the South Korean government dismissed the missile tests by characterizing them as  ""ordinary military training.""  But the United States responded to this development by noting that it was ""not constructive.""  Moreover, a spokesperson for the United States government called on Pyongyang to""focus on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula."" In July 2008, a South Korean woman was shot to death by a North Korean soldier.  North Korean authorities said that the 53-year old woman strayed from  the special tourism zone in the mountains  into a restricted area of the Mount Kumgang resort.  More than one million South Korean visitors have traveled to the resort, which is located in a strategic nazal area,  in the last decade without any such incident occurring.  South Korean authorities responded by suspending cross-border trips, pending an investigation.  Because cross-border tourism trips have been the fulcrum of economic and cultural cooperation in the last decade, the incident had the potential to adversely affect cross-border relations.  It was viewed as a setback at a time when South Korean President Lee Myung-bak has advocated  fresh dialogue with North Korea. In September 2008 when North Korean leader Kim Jong-il  failed to appear at a military parade marking the 60th anniversary of the founding of his country, and then failed to attend the annual Chuseok festival, speculation arose about the state of his health.  North Korea denied South Korean claims that Kim Jong-il was suffering from a stroke, characterizing the suggestion as ""worthless.""  A newspaper in Japan surmised that the North Korean leader was suffering from seizures in recent months and was unable to lead as a result. As with the South Korean claim, the North Korea rejected any suggestion that its leader is unwell and blamed the foreign media for carrying out a conspiracy.  Nevertheless, the question of Kim Jong-il's health sparked questions about leadership succession in  nuclear  North Korea.  There has been no public announcement about a possible successor to Kim Jong-il and, as such, there were now anxieties about a possible power vacuum.

Meanwhile, despite Kim Jong-il's absence on the national -- and international -- scene, geopolitical troubles resurfaced when Pyongyang indicated that it would start reconstituting its main nuclear facility at Yongbyon in protest of the United States' decision to keep it on a list of state sponsors of terrorism.  The development would halt -- and even reverse -- much of the diplomatic work done in recent years.  That work culminated in the 2007 agreement calling for  Pyongyang  to relinquish  its nuclear ambitions in return for humanitarian aid and diplomatic concessions.

Pyongyang finally handed over the details  relating to its nuclear program in July 2008 and destroyed its main cooling tower as a sign of its commitment to the ""disarmament for aid"" deal.  Pyongyang then expected that North Korea would be dropped from the United States' terrorism ""black list.""  However, lack of progress on that front has led to Pyongyang's belief that the United States has not fulfilled a key component of the ""disarmament for aid"" agreement, hence its decision to restart nuclear reactor at Yongbyon.  For its part, the United States has said that North Korea would remain on its list of state sponsors of terrorism until North Korea's disarmament process is fully verified.October 2008  saw the United States move to remove North Korea from its list of state-sponsors of terrorism.  The development came after multilateral talks between North Korea, the United States, China, South Korea, Russia and Japan and appeared to end some dissonance that had  been brewing in recent months, despite multilateral concurrence on North Korean disarmament.

The United States' decision to move in the direction of removing North Korea from the ""black list"" suggested that progress had been made on the verification process.  Indeed, a spokesperson for North Korea's foreign ministry confirmed that Pyongyang would now resume disabling its nuclear facilities and allow international monitors access in order for the verification process to take place. The spokesperson was reported to have said:  ""We welcome the United States' implementation of its duty to remove us from the list of states sponsoring terrorism. We have decided to resume the disabling of nuclear facilities in Yongbyon and to allow United States and International Atomic Energy Agency monitors to carry out their work again.""The situation was different some months later. The start of 2009 was marked on the Korean peninsula by devolving relations between Pyongyang and Seoul.  At issue has been the more hard-line approach taken by South Korea's President Lee Myung-Bak in the last year since coming to power.  Significantly, the South Korean president reversed the ""sunshine"" policy bestowed aid to North Korea.  President Lee said that economic assistance would now be dependent on North Korea's willingness to completely end its nuclear weapons program.

North Korea responded with outrage at the change. In January 2009, North Korea announced that it had enough plutonium stocks to produce four or five nuclear weapons. The third week of January 2009  saw North Korea warn South Korea that its ""confrontational"" policies could lead to retaliation by the nuclear power. Military authorities in Pyongyang told Seoul that it would bolster its ""nuclear deterrent force"" in the face of perceived threats. In response, South Korean authorities called for amplified troop strength. At the start of February 2009, it was reported that North Korea was preparing to test-fire the long-range Taepodong-2 missile. Then, by mid-month, North Korea was declaring its right to launch a  satellite as part of its space program. Since North Korea has, in the past, characterized rocket launches in similar terms, it was believed that the term ""space program"" was associated with the anticipated missile launch.On the other side of the equation, South Korea's President Lee Myung-Bak has eschewed beginning negotiations from too-conciliatory a stance, cautioning previous South Korean leaders had gone down that path with no substantial end result to show for those efforts. That said, the South Korean president did not foreclose re-entering peace talks with the North. To that end, he said, in a national radio address ""I am very aware there are people who are concerned about the recent series of North Korean threats. But you do not need to worry too much. The government is ready to sit down with North Korea at any time and resolve every issue.""

Multilateral talks aimed at halting North Korea's nuclear ambitions in exchange for aid saw some progress in recent years, however, the diplomatic efforts have slowed more recently. Indeed, the stance by the new South Korean leader, which was crafted by his nominee for Unification Minister, Hyun In-taek, appears to have brought diplomacy to a halt. In fact, North Korea has threatened to end all talks with the South if Hyun was confirmed for the job.

Amidst this growing imbroglio, some analysts have said that efforts by the Obama administration in the United States could potentially thaw increasingly cold relations between the two Koreas. Obama's Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, was scheduled to travel to Asia in mid-February 2009. Before arriving in Asia on her first overseas trip, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton warned North Korea against any ""provocative action and unhelpful rhetoric."" En route to Asia, Clinton said that North Korea had to adhere to its commitments to dismantle its nuclear programs. She said, ""The North Koreans have already agreed to dismantling...We expect them to fulfill the obligations that they entered into.""

But the United States' top diplomat was also critical of the Bush administration for abandoning the 1994 agreement with North Korea, which was forged during the presidency of Bill Clinton. The 1994 framework, which called for North Korea to give up its weapons program, collapsed when the Bush administration accused Pyongyang of maintaining a parallel (secondary) enriched uranium program. Clinton suggested that Pyongyang's decision to restart its nuclear program may have been partially due to the Bush administration's intemperate accusations of North Korea.

Clinton was confronted with a significant challenge on the trip to Asia, and particularly, the Korean peninsula. Amidst devolving relations between Pyongyang and Seoul, North Korea was hinting that it was preparing to test-fire the long-range Taepodong-2 missile, which has been reported to be capable of reaching Alaska from the north-eastern coast of North Korea. Accordingly, she was tasked with taking a strong positions on, first,  the missile test, and second, on North Korea's nuclear ambitions, while also working to reinvigorate the diplomatic process in the region and improving relations between Pyongyang and Washington.

To these ends, Clinton warned that relations between her country and North Korea were unlikely to improve unless Pyongyang was willing to engage in dialogue with Seoul. Clinton, who was speaking in the South Korean capital, took a sharp tone as she called on North Korea to bring an end to its nuclear ambitions, consistent with the provisions of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1718. She also characterized the notion of a missile test as ""provocative."" Nevertheless, Clinton made clear that diplomacy was the central focus of her objectives by announcing a special envoy to North Korea. Clinton aimed former Ambassador Stephen Bosworth, who served in South Korea from 1997 to 2000, to that role.By March 2009, North Korea was threatening to go to war with any entity that tried to shoot down the (aforementioned) satellite it intended to launch. A statement by the North Korean military read, ""We will retaliate any act of intercepting our satellite for peaceful purposes with prompt counter-strikes by the most powerful military means.""  It also included the following assertion: ""Shooting our satellite for peaceful purposes will precisely mean a war."" 

In a presumed effort to augment its warning, North Korea said its military was placed on full combat alert.  This warning came  at a time when scheduled joint military exercises between South Korea and the United States were about to commence. 

The 2009  Nuclear Test, Missile Tests,  and Consequences In mid-March 2009, according to the International Maritime Organization, North Korea set a date to execute its space launch between April 4-8, 2009.  Meanwhile, the newly-appointed United States envoy to North Korea,  Stephen Bosworth, who was in Asia to revitalize six-party denuclearization talks, noted that a launch by North Korea would be ""ill advised.""  As well, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton warned that if Pyongyang went ahead with the launch, there were ""a range of options"" that could be taken, including action by the United Nations Security Council.  Of significance was a clear effort not to ratchet tensions any higher as exemplified by Clinton's acknowledgement that six-party denuclearization talks would not be affected. In early April 2009, North Korea said that its attempt to launch a satellite into orbit ended in failure with parts of the rocket landing in the Pacific Ocean. But such an end did little to quell the international outcry. Throughout, the United States and South Korea have said that North Korea's claim of launching a satellite in space was just a cover for an actual missile test of the Taepodong-2. Accordingly, they have urged the United Nations Security Council to issue a strong response at an impending emergency session, which was called by Japan. The United States, South Korea and Japan regard the launch to be an abrogation of United Nations Security Resolution 1718, which in 2006 banned North Korea from ballistic missile activity. On the other side of the equation, China and Russia have advocated a restrained and measured response. Appearing in public for his first major official appearance since 2008, North Korean leader Kim Jong-il attended a parliamentary session in April 2009 in which he was re-elected as the country's leader. His arrival in the Supreme People's Assembly was met with a standing ovation. Visibly thinner than he was in the latter part of 2008, there was speculation that his health -- possibly due to a stroke -- may have been at risk. But ahead of the parliamentary vote, authorities began a public relations campaign of sorts in which Kim Jong-il was shown on video touring farms and factories across the country. Indeed, there was even some suggestion that the controversial rocket launch that took place days earlier may have been part of the campaign orchestrated to show Kim Jong-il in control of the country. Motive aside, the matter became the subject of debate at the United Nations Security Council where member states were debating what action -- if any -- should be taken against North Korea. Late in April 2009, North Korea announced that it was withdrawing from multilateral disarmament talks and restarting its operations at the Yongbyon nuclear plant. This decision to withdraw from the negotiating table and resume reprocessing spent fuel rods came after the United Nations (UN) Security Council decided to impose sanctions on three North Korean companies.  That decision by the UN Security Council was reached in the aftermath of a controversial missile launch.  North Korea maintained that it had simply launched a satellite in space and so characterized the international reaction as""a wanton violation of the UN charter."" In the face of North Korean defiance, the United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has called on North Korea to return to its previous agreement to end its nuclear program on the Korean peninsula. On May 25, 2009, North Korea said it had successfully conducted an underground nuclear test.  North Korea said this test contained more explosive power than an earlier nuclear test conducted in 2006.

Several independent entities confirmed that a powerful explosion had been registered, resulting in the conclusion that it was caused by the nuclear test.  Indeed, the United States Geological Survey said that a 4.7 magnitude seismic tremor was detected underground and indicated a nuclear explosion of some kind.   As well, the Russian Defense Ministry was also reported to have said it detected the explosion.  The actual location of the testing was unknown but South Korea noted that a seismic tremor had been detected in the north-eastern part of the country close to Kilju.  This was the area where North Korea's first nuclear test had been conducted.

Geopolitical analysts were trying to determine why North Korea had chosen to move from negotiations to a clearly confrontational stance.  Two years earlier, North Korea agreed to close its nuclear facility at Yongbyong and comply with international monitoring of its nuclear assets.  In exchange, it was to be the recipient of a generous aid package.Later, however, North Korea withdrew from long-running multilateral negotiations and stopped inspectors from monitoring  progress related to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.

There was some speculation that after a woeful harvest -- with up to a quarter of the North Korean population in desperate need of food aid, according to the World Food Programme -- Pyongyang may have been trying to divert attention from this internal crisis.  There was also some suggestion that the domestic worries may have prompted an internal power struggle, which ultimately may have spurred the move by  hard-liners within the regime.  Specifically, a power struggle stemming from the line of succession, with party loyalists backing Kim Jong-il's son, and the military opposing this move, may have led to the extroversion of military might.  Yet another theory centered on the notion that Pyongyang has a history of provocation ahead of conciliation at the negotiating table.

For its part, Pyongyang appeared to indicate its motive via a communique announced on state radio, which asserted that the underground nuclear testing had been ""successfully conducted... as part of measures to enhance the Republic's self-defensive nuclear deterrent in all directions.""  The statement went on to note that the test was intended to ""contribute to safeguard the sovereignty of the country and the nation and socialism.""  Pyongyang also offered assurances that the underground nuclear testing had ensued in a safe manner with advanced technology.

International news agencies reported that in addition to the underground nuclear test, North Korea also test-fired two short-range missiles.  There were reports that the test firing of these missiles was aimed at disrupting the ability of United States' surveillance of the nuclear testing.

The international community reacted with outrage and condemnation to these collective actions, which occurred  just a month after North Korea test fired a long-range missile capable of reaching Asia as well as parts of the United States.

Crisis talks were convened by Japan and South Korea respectively.  A spokesman for South Korean President Lee Myung-bak said that North Korea's decision to conduct nuclear testing  was a ""grave challenge"" to international non-proliferation efforts.  Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Takeo Kawamura deemed the path embarked on by North  as ""unacceptable.""

United States President Barack Obama called the action by North Korea a threat to international peace and stability.  He warned, ""The danger posed by North Korea's threatening activities warrants action by the international community.""  The American president observed that North Korea is ""not only deepening its own isolation, it's also inviting stronger international pressure.""

United Kingdom Prime Minister Gordon Brown said North Korea's nuclear activities ""undermine prospects for peace on the Korean peninsula.""

One of North Korea's closest allies, China, joined the wider international realm in decrying the nuclear testing.  The Chinese Foreign Ministry issued a statement that read: ""China expresses a resolute protest against new nuclear weapons tests carried out by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, in defiance of the objections voiced by the world community.""  The Chinese government also demanded that North Korea to honor its obligations related to denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.  At the wider level China  called for peaceful and calm dialogue to resolve the burgeoning crisis.

Another of North Korea's closest allies, Russia, closed ranks with Western powers in denouncing North Korea's actions.  The chairman of the State Duma Defense Committee, Viktor Zavarzin, echoed the words of United States President Obama.  Zavarzin said, ""The actions of the North Korean leadership can be described as threatening international peace and security. The whole world community should be involved in resolving this problem, in particular within the framework of the UN Security Council.""

Russia, which was at the helm of the rotating presidency, called for an emergency session of the United Nations (UN) Security Council, noting that North Korea had violated UN Security Council Resolution 1718.

In fact, the Russian Foreign Ministry categorically rebuked North Korea's actions in a statement that read: ""We cannot describe the North Korean move other than as a breach of UN Security Council resolution 1718, which prohibits Pyongyang from carrying out nuclear tests.""  The statement continued, ""The North Korean nuclear test has a serious impact on international efforts aiming to strengthen the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and breaches the international regime provided by the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.""

Indeed, UN Security Council Resolution 1718 exists in tandem with Article 41 of Chapter VII of the UN Charter and compels compliance by all member states.  A nuclear test would be an unassailable violation of UN Security Resolution 1718, which itself imposed sanctions in North Korea after it conducted a previous test in 2006.

Not surprisingly, the UN Security Council rapidly reacted with a strenuous statement of condemnation, registering North Korea's contravention of the resolution, demanding that North Korea return to multilateral talks aimed at denuclearization, and reminding all member states that they must comply with sanctions imposed on North Korea.  The UN Security Council also made clear that further action, in the form of a new resolution with stronger measures, was in the offing.

After the emergency meeting of the UN Security Council, Vitaly Churkin -- Russian envoy to the UN and the current president of the body -- made clear that work on the new resolution would start immediately.  He said, ""The members of the Security Council have decided to start work immediately on a Security Council resolution on this matter, in accordance with the Security Council's responsibilities under the Charter of the United Nations.""

Susan Rice, United States Ambassador to the UN, also said that the formulation of a new resolution with more stringent measures would commence right away.  Rice said, ""The US thinks that this is a grave violation of international law and a threat to regional and international peace and security. And therefore the United States will seek a strong resolution with strong measures.""

On May 27, 2009, the North Korean military announced it was abandoning the armistice that brought an end to Korean War.The North Korean military said the action was being taken in response to South Korea's decision to participate in  the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI).  North Korea said that South Korea's decision to join PSI --  a United States-led effort to patrol the oceans in search of nuclear weapons -- was tantamount to a ""declaration of war"" and promised military action if its shipping vessels were intercepted.  In another development, South Korean media reported that steam had been observed emanating from North Korea's nuclear plant at Yongbyon -- a sign indicating North Korea had decided to recommence the manufacture of weapons-grade plutonium.

By the end of the month, North Korea had fired a total of six short-range missiles and United States military officials warned that further missile launches were likely in the works.  Military officials in Washington D.C. said that satellite photographs indicated activity at a facility from which North Korea has in the past fired long-range missiles.  Meanwhile, with the UN Security Council contemplating action in response to North Korea's nuclear test days earlier, Pyongyang warned that it could take ""self defense"" actions if sanctions were imposed.In the first week of June 2009, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that North Korea could well be reinstated on her country's list of countries viewed as sponsors of terrorism.  With some politicians in the United States calling for such a response, the country's top diplomat said, ""Well, we're going to look at it. There's a process for it. Obviously we would want to see recent evidence of their support for international terrorism.""

North Korea was removed from the terror list in October 2008 when it was compliant with a denuclearization agreement brokered via multilateral talks.  But North Korea's recent decisions to pursue nuclear activities, manifest most blatantly in an underground nuclear test, as well as a volley of short-range missile tests, have rendered that agreement functionally void.Secretary of State Clinton observed, ""Obviously they were taken off of the list for a purpose and that purpose is being thwarted by their actions.""

Secretary of State Clinton also warned that North Korea was likely to face harsh consequences from the United Nations, as the international body contemplated a new resolution against North Korea.  To that end, Clinton said, ""  We think we're going to come out of this with a very strong resolution with teeth that will have consequences for the North Korean regime.""  She continued, ""If we do not take significant and effective action against the North Koreans now, we'll spark an arms race in North-East Asia.""In the second week of June 2009, Russian officials warned that North Korea was close to test-firing  another ballistic missile.  The Russian military reportedly claimed that it had accessed information pertaining to the type of rocker to be launched although it was unaware of a specific launch date.  This claim was somewhat supported by reports that North Korea warned shipping vessels to stay away from its east coast waters for a period for three weeks.

Meanwhile, the United States special envoy to North Korea, Stephen Bosworth, said in an address to the Korea Society in New York that his government was considering stronger responses to the challenges posed by North Korea's recent missile activities.  He said, ""North Korea's recent actions to develop a nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile capacity require that we expand our consideration of new responses.""  He continued, ""However, the North Korean claim to be responding to a 'threat' or a 'hostile policy' by the United States is simply groundless. Quite to the contrary, we have no intention to invade North Korea or change its regime through force, and this has been made clear to the DPRK repeatedly.""

Among the possible responses being considered by the United States were financial sanctions, as well as tougher inspections of shipping vessels in waters surrounding North Korea.  Related to these possible moves was the unanimous decision by the United Nations Security Council to impose harsh new sanctions against North Korea in response to the nuclear test carried out in May 2009.  Included in the new sanctions regime was the expected provision for the increased inspection of North Korean cargo not only on shipping vessels, but also on land and by air, and it authorized the destruction of any materials suspected of being linked to weapons of mass destruction. The new sanctions regime also expanded the arms embargo against North Korea, effectively prohibiting the sale of heavy and small arms by North Korea.

Rosemary DiCarlo, the United States deputy ambassador at the United Nations said: ""North Korea chose a path of provocation. This resolution will give us new tools to impair North Korea's ability to proliferate, and to threaten international stability.""  In a rare show of solidarity with the international powers against North Korea, China said that the measures showed that the world opposed Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions.  Indeed, Chinese ambassador, Zhang Yesui, said: ""We strongly urge the DPRK (North Korea) to honor its commitment to de-nuclearization, stop any moves that may further worsen the situation, and return to the six-party talks.""  He also rebuked North Korea for jeopardizing regional security by carrying out the nuclear test.

For its part, North Korea reacted to these developments by threatening to weaponize its stocks of plutonium.  United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that this threat by Pyongyang was both ""provocative"" and ""deeply regrettable.""  She warned that the move would serve only to isolate North Korea even further from the wider international community. Meanwhile, a political confrontation between the United States and North Korea could become more likely after reports emerged that a North Korea court convicted two American journalists of  ""hostile acts"" and illegal entry into the communist state.  Despite international protests and the two journalists' insistence of innocence, Laura Ling and Euna Lee were sentenced them to 12 years in a labor prison. The  families of the two journalists have urged that they not be part of the burgeoning political challenge over North Korea's nuclear activities. In other developments in North Korea, Kim Jong-nam, the eldest son of North Korean President Kim Jong-il, confirmed in an interview with Japanese media that his youngest brother -- Kim Jong-un -- was named to succeed his father. Kim Jong-nam also said,  ""The appointment of a successor is totally my father's decision."" By the third week of June 2009,  as reports emerged about a long range missile launch by North Korea -- quite possibly in the direction of Hawaii -- United States Defense Secretary Robert Gates noted that his country was ""in a good position"" to protect itself.  Secretary Gates said, ""We do have some concerns if they were to launch a missile to the west in the direction of Hawaii."" But he made it clear that the United States had approved the deployment of both radar and missiles ""provide support,"" should the American state of Hawaii face attack.  United States President Barack Obama later echoed these assurances in an interview with CBS News.  President Obama said,  ""This administration - and our military - is fully prepared for any contingencies.""The American president dismissed the notion that it was warning of a military response against North Korea.  But he also said, ""I don't want to speculate on hypotheticals.  But I do want to give assurances to the American people that the T's are crossed and the I's are dotted."" In other developments, United States President Barack Obama  renewed its sanctions -- separate from the United Nations sanctions -- against North Korea.  President Obama explained that North Korea's nuclear development combined with threats posed a national security risk to the United States and destabilized the region of eastern Asia. The American president also said his administration would end the cycle of responding to North Korean nuclear threats by granting concessions and incentives to Pyongyang.Around the same time, the United States, North Korea's neighbors and the wider international community were all  bracing for a possible missile launch by Pyongyang in the direction of Hawaii -- a presumed act of retaliation for the new sanctions.  Earlier, President Obama had said that the United States military was prepared to deal with any of contingencies posed by  a possible North Korean missile launch.  On July 2, 2009, North Korea test-fired four short-range missiles.  According to South Korea's Yonhap News Agency,  two surface-to-ship missiles had been fired from the port of Wonsan while the other two were launched  from Sinsang-ni.  All four were fired into the Sea of Japan, which South Korea regards as the ""East Sea.""  The missile tests were not surprising as Pyongyang issued warnings to shipping vessels, urging them to avoid coastal waters.  Two days later, North Korea was suspected of firing another seven ballistic missiles.  These seven  Scud-type missiles were launched from an east coast base and, as before, fell into the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea.

The timing of the missile tests coincided with the United States' celebration of its  Independence Day on July 4, 2009, and was regarded as a clear act of defiance against Washington.  Nevertheless, the United States was joined by Russia and China in calling for calm.  Russia and China urged North Korea to return to the negotiating table and said all parties should work to avoid further destabilization of the region.  The United States also said that the tense situation should not be exacerbated. Using highly restrained language, a United States Department of State official said the volley of missile tests were ""not helpful"" and said that North Korea should not ""aggravate tensions"" but instead ""focus on denuclearization talks.""  While British Foreign Secretary David Miliband echoed this sentiment by saying that tensions on t he Korean peninsula should remain ""at manageable levels,"" Japan and South Korea struck a somewhat harsher tone in saying that the missile launches constituted  an ""act of provocation."" In August 2009, former United States President Bill Clinton traveled to Pyongyang in the North Korea to try to press for the release of two American journalists, Laura Ling and Euna Lee, who had been arrested and sentenced to prison for crossing the border into North Korea.  Former President Clinton -- the husband of the United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton -- arrived in Pyongyang in the early hours of August 4, 2009 and was warmly met by a North Korean delegation that included a nuclear negotiator.   The landmark visit by the former United States leader came at a time of increasing tensions between Pyongyang and the West over its nuclear program.  After a meeting between Clinton and Kim Jong-il, a special pardon for Ling and Lee was announced.  Former President Bill Clinton is the highest ranking American to visit North Korea since his own Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met with Kim Jong-il in 2000.  Whether or not this particular success would extend to an overall thaw in relations between Pyongyang and Washington D.C. was yet to be seen. See ""Foreign Relations"" for details. 

Later in August 2009, North Korea deployed envoys to the United States to meet with New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson.  The seasoned diplomat, Richardson,  served as United Nations ambassador and Energy Secretary under the Clinton administration in the 1990s, and was responsible for helping to broker an agreement with the North Koreans that brought a temporary end to its nuclear development.

Following his meeting with the North Koreans, Governor Richardson, a Democrat who endorsed Barack Obama for president, said that believed that Pyongyang had issued ""good signals"" that pointed toward the restarting of dialogue with Washington.  Indeed, multilateral talks on North Korea's controversial nuclear program had stalled in recent times, and relations became increasingly strained after North Korea went forward with an underground nuclear, followed by a succession of missile tests.  Now, however, in the aftermath of a successful but unofficial trip by former President Bill Clinton to North Korea to secure the release of two American journalists, Governor Richardson said that he believed the climate had improved.  Indeed, Governor Richardson said that he indicated a ""thaw"" in relations and believed that North Korea was ""ready for a new dialogue with the United States regarding the nuclear issue.""

That said, an actual diplomatic breakthrough was still in the offing. According to Governor Richardson, North Korea remained intransigent on the issue of returning to six-party talks. Instead,  Pyongyang believed that it had earned some goodwill and wanted to pursue direct bilateral talks with the United States.  To this end, Governor Richardson said that Pyongyang had ""obviously used the journalists as a bargaining chip"" and was looking for a reciprocal  a ""gesture"" from Washington.

The Obama administration has indicated that while it was willing to return to the negotiating table with North Korea within the multilateral framework, with an eye on irreversible denuclearization, it would not soon engage in direct talks.  State Department spokesman, Ian Kelly, said:  ""Our goal is the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. And, of course, we want to see progress toward that.""

The White House also made clear that it had not orchestrated the meeting between the North Korean envoys and the New Mexico governor. As well, Governor Richardson expressly noted that he was not acting as an emissary on behalf of President Obama. After the meeting between the Governor Richardson and the North Korean envoys, North Korea invited the United States envoy to North Korea, Stephen Bosworth, for direct negotiations on its nuclear program.  South Korea media reported that there were rumblings about the White House giving serious consideration to the idea of actually sending Bosworth to North Korea. But on the record, the United States embassy in Seoul would offer no comment on the matter. On September 18, 2009,North Korean leader Kim Jong Il said that he was ready for talks aimed at resolving his country's nuclear dispute with the international community.  According to China's state-run new agency Xinhua, Kim Jong-il said, ""North Korea will continue to maintain its goal of denuclearization and make efforts for the protection of peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula."" In an indication that he was prepared for either direct talks with the United States or to return to six-party talks, he said:  ""I hope to resolve this issue through bilateral or multilateral dialogue.""  These declarations signaled a marked shift in rhetoric from North Korea, which appeared to be moving back toward the negotiating table.  Meanwhile,  China's presidential envoy, Dai Bingguo, traveled to Pyongyang with an eye on just this objective of bringing North Korea back to denuclearization talks. In other developments, South Korea and  North Korea agreed to the arrange reunions for separated families from either side of the Korean peninsula.  The reunions were scheduled to be held  from September 26, 2009  to October 1, 2009 in the Mount Gumgang area.The agreement was forged following talks between  delegates from the respective Red Cross societies in North Korea and South Korea.A joint statement read as follows:""The South and the North will continue to cooperate on the issue of separated families and other humanitarian issues involving the Red Cross.""The program of reuniting Korean families commenced in 2000 following a landmark inter-Korean summit.  Since that time, the two sides have held several reunions and orchestrated a number of  video exchanges although the last such meetings took place in October 2007.  Soon thereafter, South Korea's hard line government of President Lee Myung-bak came to power, bilateral relations devolved, and the program was suspended.  This 2009 agreement could be  illustrative of a possible  breakthrough between the two sides. On  October 12, 2009, North Korea fires five short-range missiles into Sea of Japan (also known as the East Sea).  The surface-to-surface KN-02 missiles with a range of 75 miles  were launched south of Musudan-ri in the North Hamgyeong Province.  As a precaution, North Korea had banned shipping vessels from the waters off the east and west coasts from October 10 to October 20, 2009, according to the Yonhap news agency.  It was the first missile launches by North Korea  in several months  and came after North Korea said that it was willing to return to multilateral talks about its nuclear program.  At a time when North Korea indicated a willingness to return to the negotiating table for multilateral talks on its nuclear program, China extended an overture of goodwill.  In late October 2009, Chinese President Hu Jintao invited his  North Korean counterpart,  Kim Jong-il,  for a visit.  The invitation was offered when a North Korean official was in China for a meeting, intended to strengthen ties between the two countries and mark their six decade-long alliance.  It was believed that North Korea was in the mood to reach out to the wider international community and was looking to re-open dormant nuclear talks.  On Nov. 10, 2009, South Korean and North Korean ships exchanged heavy fire at sea in South Korean waters when a North Korean patrol boat traversed the Northern Limit Line, which demarcates the boundary between the two Koreas.The exchange of fire was described as having lasted only for a short period of time and left a North Korean vessel in flames but with no casualties on the South Korean side. There was no information available on the casualties -- if any -- from Pyongyang.  Whereas the South Korean authorities characterized the incident as ""accidental,"" the North Koreans said it was an ""armed provocation.""

Despite this incident, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that talks between Washington and Pyongyang would go forward, as planned.  Speaking at the  Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation  summit in Singapore, Secretary Clinton said,  ""This does not in any way affect the decision to send ambassador Bosworth. We think that this is an important step that stands on its own.""   To that end, Bosworth was expected to travel to Pyongyang  for direct talks with the North Koreans following the Asia-Pacific summit. It would be the first direct contact between the United States and North Korea in more than a year.  On the agenda during that meeting would be the matter of North Korea's return to the stalled six-party talks on denuclearization. 

On Dec. 12, 2009, Thailand seized a cargo plane that was said to be carrying 40 tons of weapons from North Korea to an unknown destination. The chartered Soviet-designed Il-76 aircraft, which originated in the North Korean capital city of Pyongyang,  was refueling at the Bangkok airport when it was intercepted by the Thai military. The ensuing raid of the aircraft resulted in the uncovering of missiles, rocket-propelled grenades and other weapons.  As well, five crew members -- four from Kazakhstan and one from Belarus -- were detained and taken into Thai custody. The Thai authorities said they were acting as a result of a tip from foreign intelligence.  Reuters reported that the source was actually United States intelligence, based on information supplied by an anonymous source.  Reuters quoted that anonymous source as saying: ""It [the plane] came from North Korea and was heading for somewhere in South Asia, probably Pakistan.""While another news report stated the aircraft was headed on to Sri Lanka, geopolitical analysts suggested that the Indian Ocean island might not have been the ultimate destination.

Thai Deputy Prime Minister Suthep Thaungsuban confirmed that the weapons had been found aboard the aircraft and that a transparent investigation was in the offing. Indeed, such an investigation was likely to have international effects since the United Nations increased sanctions against North Korea earlier in the year in response to controversial nuclear testing.  Those sanctions expressly addressed the transshipment of weaponry.  But impoverished North Korea derives much of its revenue from arms sales to countries in the Middle East.

Developments in 2010 - 2011 By early 2010, North Korea indicated that part of the new phase of negotiations on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula should include a new peace treaty to replace the armistice that ended the Korean War.  North Korea said that a peace agreement should form the fulcrum of  negotiations on this matter and should be addressed prior to the return to six-party talks aimed at ending Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program, or, as a central part of those multilateral negotiations.  In a statement published by North Korea's state-run news agency, the North Korean Foreign Ministry said: ""If a peace treaty is signed, it will help resolve hostile relations between North Korea and the United States and speed up the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.""  North Korea also called for an end to the United Nations sanctions, which were  imposed after it conducted  nuclear and ballistic missile tests in 2009.  North Korean officials said that its return to the negotiating table was contingent upon the lifting of those sanctions.On January 29, 2010, North Korea reportedly fired artillery shells in the area of the Yellow Sea, close to the country's  maritime border with South Korea.  It was third day that North Korea had carried out such action, according to the South Korean military.  Speculation abounded that the provocative action by North Korea may have been aimed at forcing the United States and South Korea to respond to its proposal for a peace treaty to officially end the Korean War, which has effectively ceased via a prevailing armistice rather than an actual peace agreement.  North Korea, as discussed above,  has argued that it cannot advance further denuclearization talks without the foundation of a peace treaty. In February 2010, reports from Reuters indicated that dire economic conditions in North Korea has led not only to mass starvation of already-impoverished North Korean citizens, but also growing unrest and social destabilization as a result of these realities.  The situation has led to speculation that North Korea may be under pressure to end its boycott of multilateral denuclearization talks, with an eye on gaining international aid.  Indeed, North Korea's recent actions -- both its provocative firing of artillery shells as well as its newly-found desire for a peace agreement -- are related to its underlying desire to return to the negotiating table, knowing that any likely agreement would also contain humanitarian aid. In late March 2010, North Korea accused South Korea  of carrying out  psychological warfare by facilitating journalist tours in the demilitarized border zone between the two countries..  North Korea warned South Korea that there would be repercussions for these actions, claiming that the tours allowed reporters to tour the zone and prepare ""materials for anti-north smear campaigns."" A  statement issued by Pyongyang said those these actions were in violation of the armistice, which brought at ended to the hostilities in the 1950-1953 war.  The statement also warned that the United States would be held responsible for any negative fallout saying: ""If the U.S. and the South Korean authorities persist in their wrong acts to misuse the DMZ for the inter-Korean confrontation despite our warnings, these will entail unpredictable incidents including the loss of human lives in this area for which the U.S. side will be wholly to blame."" Analysts have suggested that this may be another circuitous attempt by North Korea to draw the United States into direct negotiations and press for a treaty officially ending the war.  North Korea earlier suggested that no progress could be made on the denuclearization issue without such a treaty being forged.  Note that these developments came in the aftermath of the sinking of a South Korean military ship on March 27, 2010, in the conflict ridden waters of the border zone.  Both South Korea and the United States said they did not believe that North Korea was involved in that incident. In April 2010, investigations into the sinking of  that South Korean warship near the North Korean border cast new suspicions on Pyongyang's possible involvement, although Seoul was careful not to expressly place the blame in that direction.  Initial reports indicated that the underwater explosion was caused by a torpedo.  South Korean Defense Minister Tae-young said that a close range external explosion appeared to have destroyed  the vessel.  In an interview with the media, the South Korean cabinet minister said, ""Basically, I think the bubble jet effect caused by a heavy torpedo is the most likely cause.""  Kim was careful to refrain from speculating about who might be behind the firing of a torpedo and said that the investigation still had to be completed.  South Korea confirmed in the third week of May 2010 that North Korea was behind the March 2010 incident in which one of its warships located in the conflict ridden waters of the border zone was destroyed. South Korean investigators earlier said that a torpedo hit the ship, killing 46 people. Despite knowing the cause of the sinking of the warship, South Korea had been circumspect in ascribing blame. Now, however, South Korea was asserting that its neighbor to the north was behind the mysterious incident. Clearly, South Korea's confidence in naming North Korea as the responsible party would change the geopolitical landscape.  North Korea immediately responded by denying any such role, promising dire consequences, and warning that war was inevitable if South Korea sought retribution. Pyongyang promised to cease any cooperation with Seoul and warned that it would abrogate the North-South non-aggression pact, if Seoul moved to retaliate. Moreover, Pyongyang issued a statement noting that ""a war may break out right now"" and that it ""will regard the present situation as the phase of a war and decisively handle all matters arising in inter-Korean relations to cope with it.""For his part, South Korean Prime Minister Lee Myung-bak described the sinking incident as a ""surprise military attack from North Korea [that came] while South Korean people were resting late at night."" Prime Minister Lee also said his country would indeed take ""resolute countermeasures"" against the North over the sinking of the war ship. Given Seoul's position that its response would be ""prudent,"" and the vulnerability of the South Korean people in terms of proximity, it was unlikely that the response would involve military retaliation.During a formal address on the matter, President Lee said his country would take the matter up at the United Nations Security Council. He also announced the suspension of inter-Korean exchanges and said that North Korean ships would be banned from passing through South Korean waters. Explaining the rationale behind these measures, President Lee said, ""We have always tolerated North Korea's brutality, time and again. We did so because we have always had a genuine longing for peace on the Korean peninsula."" He continued, ""But now things are different. North Korea will pay a price corresponding to its provocative acts.""In response to South Korea's moves, North Korea severed all ties with its neighbor, including communications links and the passage of ships and aircraft from territorial waters and airspace respectively. According to Pyongyang's official news agency, North Korea also intended to expel all South Korean workers at a factory to the north of the border, which has jointly-administered. Indeed, a statement publicized via the official news agency read as follows: ""The Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea... formally declares that from now on it will put into force the resolute measures to totally freeze the inter-Korean relations, totally abrogate the agreement on non-aggression between the North and the South and completely halt the inter-Korean cooperation.""These developments did not bode well for the process of reconciliation between the two Koreas. Still, Seoul seemed intent on winning the public relations war across the border. To this end, there were plans to send propaganda leaflets and flash electronic billboard messages to North Korea, explaining the sinking of the warship. As well, there were plans for the resumption of propaganda broadcasts to North Korea for the same reason.Earlier, United States Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, en route to Asia, made clear that North Korea would have to face consequences for its apparent intemperate actions. On the diplomatic front once in Asia, United States Secretary of State Clinton enjoyed little progress in drawing China into the equation to place pressure on North Korea. The United States, which firmly backed South Korea, was hoping for a joint response to the act of provocation from North Korea. However, China offered only a call for all sides to demonstrate restraint. That said, in a measure presumably intended to demonstrate solidarity and inflict some degree of intimidation, the United States announced it would conduct joint anti-submarine naval exercises with South Korean forces.By the first week of June 2010, South Korea had referred North Korea to the United Nations over the matter of the torpedoed warship.  While South Korea seemed intent on forcing North Korea to face consequences for its actions, it was not seeking a particular action by the international body. Instead, South Korean President Lee Myung-Bak said during a speech in Singapore that ""North Korea must admit its wrongdoing.""  Speculation abounded that with China, which wields a veto on the United Nations Security Council, unlikely to support the notion of sanctions against North Korea, South Korea was likely to be seeking some other form of international rebuke against the North. For its part, North Korea dispatched a letter to the United Nations Security Council rejecting claims it sank the South Korean warship.  North Korea also warned the international body to refrain from debating the issue, saying that it should instead facilitate Pyongyang's own internal inquiry into the incident.In the third week of July 2010, the United States (U.S.) announced that it was imposing new sanctions against North Korea. The announcement by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton came in the aftermath of her visit to the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) that separates North Korea from South Korea. Secretary of State Clinton explained that the sanctions would target North Korea's sale and purchase of arms, and were aimed at preventing nuclear proliferation and discouraging provocative actions by North Korea.

South Korea accused North Korea of provocative action over the sinking of its Cheonan warship months earlier, which an international investigation ultimately blamed on North Korea despite Pyongyang's denial of culpability. As one the most sanctioned countries in the world, these new sanctions were likely intended to intensify the pressure on North Korea in response to the Cheonan incident. In fact, as indicated by Secretary of State Clinton, they were aimed at compelling Pyongyang to take responsibility for the sinking of the warship that left 47 dead. For its part, North Korea warned that fresh sanctions would be interpreted as an act of war.

Tensions on the peninsula were unlikely to decrease since the U.S. and South Korea conducted joint naval exercises, which North Korea characterized as ""dangerous sabre-rattling."" But defense officials of United States and South Korea said that the military drills were intended to deliver a clear message to North Korea that its ""aggressive"" behavior should cease. Indeed, the North Korean official news agency reported the following statement from the government in Pyongyang: ""The army and people of the DPRK will legitimately counter with their powerful nuclear deterrence the largest-ever nuclear war exercises to be staged by the U.S. and the South Korean puppet forces.""  

On September 27, 2010, it was announced via the Korean Central News Agency that North Korean leader Kim Jong Il had promoted his son, Kim Jong Un, to the rank of general in the Korean People's Army. The news came at the start of national political meetings of the ruling Workers' Party meeting, which was itself touted as the country's most significant political conference in three decades. But it was the announcement about Kim Jong Un that commanded national and, indeed, international attention. Moreover, it sparked speculation that Kim Jong-il's son was being tapped to succeed his father at the helm of the country. At issue in recent times has been Kim Jong-il's ill health and anxieties about who would fill the power chasm after his death. With the companion news that Kim Jong-il's sister, Kim Kyong Hui, had also been promoted, there was also growing speculation that she might be tapped to serve as a caretaker leader after Kim Jong-il's death, until Kim Jong Un was ready to take on the top post in North Korea. Kim Kyong Hui's influence has been highlighted by her increasing appearances with her brother's during trips and events.

It should be noted that on October 8, 2010, a top North Korean official from the ruling Workers Party, Yang Hyong Sop, said that North Koreans would be honored to follow  Kim Jong Un -- the third-generation leader of the communist nation. Indeed, it was Kim Jung-il's father,  Kim Il Sung, who founded that nation state of North Korea in 1948 upon the notion of ""juche"" or self-reliance.  Yang said,  ""Our people are honored to serve the great President Kim Il Sung and the great leader Kim Jong Il."" He continued,  ""Now we also have the honor of serving young Gen. Kim Jong Un.""  The remarks made  official the speculation that Kim Jong Un was the named successor to Kim Jung-il.  In late October 2010, North Korean and South Korean troops exchanged fire across the border. According to accounts from authorities in Seoul, North Korean troops fired two rounds in the direction of a front line unit at Hwacheon, prompting South Korean troops to return fire. No further exchange of fire followed the incident and there were no injuries to South Korean troops. There was no consensus as to whether or not North Korea's actions constituted a direct provocation.  Only days later on November 3, 2010, South Korea's navy fired warning shots at a North Korean fishing vessel in  maritime border waters.  

In the last week of November 2010, an exchange of fire occurred between North Korean and South Korean forces, leaving two South Korean marines dead, 16 other South Korean marines injured, and three civilians wounded.  At issue was the shelling of the inhabited Yeonpyeong Island by North Korea, located in close proximity the disputed  Yellow Sea maritime border, just off the North Korean coast.  South Korea, whose military was conducting military exercises in the waters off Yeonpyeong Island, reportedly  returned fire, spurring one of the most serious clashes between the North and the South since the Korean War.  Some fifty shells reportedly landed on the island, largely hitting a South Korean military base in the area.  South Korea returned a fire with about 80 shells; the casualties on the north side of the border were not known.

South Korean President Lee Myung-bak convened  a meeting of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the capital city of Seoul.  Following the meeting, he announced that the South Korean military would punish North Korea for its attack, adding that it was vital that Pyongyang not engage in further provocation.

For its part, Pyongyang placed the blame on South Korea for igniting the clashes. It should be noted that Seoul disputes the North Korean version of the events that transpired. Nevertheless, according to the state-run KCNA news agency, ""The South Korean enemy, despite our repeated warnings, committed reckless military provocations of firing artillery shells into our maritime territory near Yeonpyeong Island.""  The North, therefore, was prepared to strike back if South Korea ""dares to invade our sea territory.""

United States President Barack Obama characterized the incident an ""outrageous, provocative act"" by North Korea. Russia struck a similar tone with Russian  Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warning of a ""colossal danger""  and characterizing those responsible for the clashes as carrying a huge responsibility.  The European Union also added its voice to the litany of condemnations. Japanese Prime Minister, Naoto Kan, took a defensive stance in the national interests of his country, saying that his government had to prepare for the occurrence of ""any unexpected event.""

But China, North Korea's closest ally, offered a murky suggestion that the two Koreas should ""do more to contribute to peace.""  A spokesperson for the Chinese government also called for restarting  six-party negotiations on North Korea's nuclear program -- a prospect that seemed practically unlikely, given these latest developments.  Indeed, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency, President Lee Myung-bak was reported to have informed a visiting Chinese foreign policy adviser, Dai Bingguo, that his country (South Korea) was not interested in the resumption of the multilateral nuclear talks; the South Korean leader apparently emphasized the importance of immediately dealing with North Korea's aggressive actions of late.

In another development, South Korean Defense Minister Kim Tae-young came under fire for ignoring intelligence reports that alerted his country of possible attacks from the North, as well as the country's slow and weak responses to the threat posed by Pyongyang.  Perhaps not surprisingly, he was forced to resign from his post.

To date, there have been occasional flare ups in the border regions since the Korean War ended without a  peace treaty in 1953.  However, the attack on Yeonpyeong Island  occurred at a time of increased tensions between the two Koreas. Months earlier in March 2010, as discussed above, South Korea accused North Korea of torpedoing one of its warships  in the area of the western maritime border, also known as the Northern Limit Line. For its part, North Korea has denied that charge and has also insisted that South Korea engage in diplomatic talks with Pyongyang aimed at easing tensions, or, deal with ""catastrophic"" consequences. Then, in late October 2010, as discussed above, North Korean and South Korean troops exchanged fire across the border. According to accounts from authorities in Seoul, North Korean troops fired two rounds in the direction of a front line unit at Hwacheon, prompting South Korean troops to return fire. No further exchange of fire followed the incident and there were no injuries to South Korean troops. There was no consensus as to whether or not North Korea's actions constituted a direct provocation. Only days later on November 3, 2010, South Korea's navy fired warning shots at a North Korean fishing vessel in maritime border waters.

At the time, South Korea  sought to downplay the incidences or the prospects of trouble emanating from the North. Indeed, during a news conference focused on an impending summit in Seoul, South Korean President Lee Myung-bak had said, ""I don't think the North will try to do anything when leaders of the international community are meeting to discuss the world economy."" He continued, ""I trust the North won't do anything but still we are fully prepared.""

On the other side of the border, while North Korea has a history of making provocative moves, many analysts said that it was unlikely that Pyongyang would seek to alienate the international community, especially at a time when it has been revealing its new leadership succession team to the world. Earlier, President Kim Jong-il's son was given a military promotion, and sanctioned as the likely successor to the ailing leader. Of course, as illustrated by the events in late November 2010 on Yeonpyeong Island, it was apparent that the path of provocation was the one being traversed by North Korea.

Attention was on the matter of why North Korea would seek to heighten the state of volatility on the Korean Peninsula.  Perhaps, for North Korea, this is a simple matter of defending its interests.  However, it could well be that the aforementioned analysts interpreted the matter of leadership transition incorrectly.  It could well be that North Korea is not concerned with the matter of alienating the international community. Instead, at this time of leadership transition from ailing President Kim Jong-il to his son, the priority from Pyongyang is to establish North Korea's power, and to show the military elite in North Korea that the named successor is not afraid to embrace a muscular stance in relation to the South, and indeed, the world.

The situation on the Korean peninsula has been made more complicated by the November 2010 revelation that North Korea constructed a  new nuclear facility. A nuclear scientist from Stanford University in the United States, Dr. Siegfried Hecker, said that during a visit to North Korea, he was shown a new nuclear facility.  There -- at the new nuclear facility at the Yongbyon nuclear complex to the north of the capital of Pyongyang -- he viewed ""more than 1,000 centrifuges"" for enriching uranium -- elements needed for the production of nuclear weapons.

Since  the nuclear facility did not exist when international nuclear weapons inspectors were expelled from North Korea in 2009, it was clear that it had been constructed quickly.  But Dr. Hecker noted that the facility boasted a high level of sophistication, and as reported in the New York Times, it included an ""ultra-modern control room.""  According to Dr. Hecker, the facility appeared oriented for the use of civilian nuclear power.  Noting that there was no sign of plutonium production, which is needed for weapons proliferation, Dr. Hecker nonetheless cautioned in an interview with the Associated Press that the new facility could be ""readily converted to produce highly enriched uranium bomb fuel.""

Dr. Hecker additionally  shored up previous reports that North Korea has been constructing a light-water nuclear  reactor.  His observations on the ground in North Korea appeared to coincide with satellite imagery depicting the construction of the reactor at Yongbyon.  Typically, light-water reactors are associated with civilian energy usage, however, uranium  enrichment is part of the process, it was not inconceivable that further enrichment could potentially ensue at weapons-grade levels.

To date, North Korea is believed to have sufficient weaponized plutonium for about six atomic bombs, although there has been little evidence to suggest that the country has actively pursued a weapons program.  That being said, Western powers have been advocating a resumption of the stalled six-party talks dealing with North Korea's nuclear program.In November 2010, a senior United States Department of State envoy, Stephen Bosworth, was in Asia on a trip aimed at reviving the multilateral negotiations. However, this latest act of provocation by North Korea on Yeonpyeong Island left the United States with no choice but to disengage from the multilateral diplomatic process, essentially ruling out the resumption of six-party talks on North Korea's nuclear disarmament for the foreseeable future.

On Nov. 23, 2010, in an interview with ABC News, United States President Barack Obama characterized North Korea's shelling of Yeonpyeong Island as ""a serious and ongoing threat that needs to be dealt with. President Obama also reaffirmed his country's alliance with South Korea, describing that country as an important ally. He said, ""We strongly affirm our commitment to defend South Korea as part of that alliance."" The United States president also noted, ""We want to make sure all the parties in the region recognize that this is a serious and ongoing threat that needs to be dealt with."" This statement appeared to target China, as he continued saying that Pyongyang needs to know ""that there are a set of international rules they need to abide by.""

By the close of November 2010, tensions on the Korean peninsula remained high, as South Korea and the United States carried out joint military exercises in the Yellow Sea, to the south of the disputed maritime border. North Korea said it viewed the previously -arranged military exercises as a provocation and warned of retaliation if there was any violation of its territorial waters. A statement from Pyongyang broadcast by the state-controlled KCNA news agency read as follows: ""We will deliver a brutal military blow on any provocation which violates our territorial waters.""

At the start of December 2010, South Korea took a highly assertive position. The South Korean defense minister-designate, Kim Kwan-jin, warned that North Korea would face a harsh response, including air strikes, if it dared to act aggressively in the future. Kim Kwan-jin's remarks were made in parliament as he answered questions during his confirmation hearing. In response to the question of how he would react to another violent action by North Korea, Kim Kwan-jin said, ""If North Korea provokes again, we will definitely use aircraft to attack North Korea."" Clearly, this posture by South Korea was a marked departure from its long-held restraint in the face of North Korea's provocations. Making clear that it intended to maintain this assertive posture, South Korea also said that it was going to carry out military drills from the aforementioned Yeonpyeong Island, even though North Korea has condemned those plans and warned that it would retaliate with force. With Pyongyang and Seoul at odds with one another in such a marked fashion, there were heightened anxieties about the renewal of war on the Korean peninsula.

Yet even with those fears at hand, the landscape became even more complicated when in mid-December 2010, South Korea said that it suspected North Korea of secretly enriching uranium at locations beyond its main nuclear site at Yongbyon.  South Korean Foreign Minister Kim Sung-hwan would not confirm a media report that North Korea was home to three more plants where uranium enrichment could take place, however, he admitted to having suspicions along these lines. During a news conference, he said, ""It is a report based on what is still intelligence and let me just say that we have been following this issue for some time."" Should this claim be proved correct, North Korea could conceivably possess material -- potentially for building more nuclear bombs. Moreover, such actions would fly in the face of renewed nuclear disarmament talks, which were already on a downward slide as a result of North Korea's latest aggressive actions (as discussed above).

By the third week of December 2010, intense dissonance characterized relations on the Korean peninsula for the myriad reasons discussed above. Former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, who also served as ambassador to the United Nations, was acting as an unofficial United States envoy in the region, with an eye on reducing the level of tensions. That job, however, was not helped when United Nations meetings on the matter ended with no resolution. Nevertheless, there were signs of progress when North Korea began to reverse course, effectively moving away from its threats to take retaliatory action against South Korea for the aforementioned military drills. The shift from Pyongyang came after South Korea evacuated residents from the area on and around Yeonpyeong Island and launched fighter jets from its terrain. Analysts surmised that the strong stance from South Korea may have forced North Korea to rethink the likely consequences of making good on expressed threats. As explained by Governor Richardson, ""South Korea was able to flex its muscles, and North Korea reacted in a statesmanlike manner.""  But despite these encouraging indications, on Dec. 23, 2010, the rhetoric between the two Koreas was on the rise once again. South Korea's president was promising harsh retaliation if his country was again attacked, while  North Korean was warning of a ""sacred"" nuclear war, if provoked.

Meanwhile, Governor Richardson -- a seasoned diplomat -- who has had years of experience negotiating with the North Koreans, announced that North Korea was willing to offer concessions in regard to their nuclear program. In an interview with the Associated Press, Governor Richardson said, ""We had positive results."" He continued, ""I hope this will signal a new chapter and a round of dialogue to lessen tension on the Korean peninsula."" Given the increasing concerns about North Korea's capacity to build nuclear bombs, this development was welcomed. But, as United States Department of State spokesman, P.J. Crowley, cautioned, ""North Korea talks a great game. They always do. The real issue is what will they do. If they are agreeable to returning IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] inspectors to their country, they need to tell the IAEA that."" In a New Year's message at the close of 2010, North Korea appeared to strike a conciliatory note as it called for dialogue with South Korea. North Korea was reported to have called for ""a lasting peace system on the Korean Peninsula,"" which it said should be made ""nuclear-free through dialogue and negotiations."" Heightened tensions have marked relations between the two Koreas since the sinking of a South Korean warship by the North earlier in 2010, and reached a nadir at the close of the year, following the shelling of Yeonpyeong Island (under South Korean jurisdiction) by the North. For its part, Seoul opted to take a more aggressive stance in relation to Pyongyang since these events by carrying out military exercises in the border zones and increasing its rhetoric. Now, the call for improved relations by Pyongyang may have been interpreted as a shift in stance, aimed at lowering tensions on the Korean peninsula. However, Pyongyang's message, which was publicized via North Korean state media, went onto to warn of increased military strength. The New Year's message said that North Korea's military would ""conduct intense combat training in an atmosphere of actual battle as required by the tense situation."" On February 9, 2011, bilateral talks between the two Koreas were reported to have broken down.  Delegates from North Korea and South Korea had been meeting in  the border village of Panmunjom with the intent of working through a number of sensitive cross-border issues.  There were hopes that the security talks would ease tensions between the two Koreas, which reached a nadir after the shelling of a South Korean island by North Korean forces in November 2010.  Significantly, these discussions were intended to set the foundation for further, higher-level, negotiations.  However, the disintegration of these talks meant that there was no consensus on an agenda for future meetings. In July 2011, some good news was brewing in the realm of foreign relations. The United States and North Korea completed a set of exploratory discussions, which North Korea's envoy, Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye Gwan, characterized as positive.  Speaking of his meetings with United States Ambassador Stephen Bosworth, the Obama administration's leading representative on North Korean affairs, Kim Kye Gwan said, ""Yesterday and today we discussed comprehensively, with Mr. Bosworth, matters of mutual interest. The talks were very constructive and businesslike and we continue to maintain contacts.""  For his part, Ambassador Bosworth said, ""These discussions are designed to explore the willingness of North Korea to take concrete and irreversible steps toward denuclearization."" These bilateral talks were intended to be a precursor to the resumption of multilateral denuclearization  negotiations.  To that end, Ambassador Bosworth said that his country would enter consultations with  South Korea and other countries involved multilateral negotiations that have been ongoing for years, to consider how to proceed further with North Korea.

Later in August 2011, though, prospects for a return to multilateral talks were dimmed when an imbroglio ensued between North Korea and South Korea.  The situation was spurred when shells from North Korea were fired close to the maritime border with South Korea.  In response, the South Korean navy  fired warning shots towards North Korea. According to South Korean sources, artillery shells from North Korea landed in the Yellow Sea close to Yeonpyeong Island, which is under Seoul's jurisdiction.  Further rounds were fired on the same day.  Defense officials from South Korea  surmised that the initial firing of shells may have been due to training exercises by North Korea.  Nevertheless, South Korea wasted no time in responding with warning shots. It should be noted that Yeonpyeong Island was in the global purview in late 2010 when North Korea fired shells in that direction, leaving four people dead and triggering the outrage of South Korea and its allies. As the month drew to a close, tension increased when five South Koreans were arrested for spying on behalf of North Korea.  South Korean prosecutors said that the five individuals conveyed sensitive  military and political information to the North over a period of two decades.  Among the sensitive material were satellite images of major military installations, as well as field manuals of United States forces in South Korea.  All five individuals were accused by South Korean authorities of violating the country's  national security law, engaging in espionage, and communication with an enemy. 

The Death of Kim Jong-il On Dec. 19, 2011, it was announced that North Korea's mercurial and autocratic leader, Kim Jong-il, had died. Blamed for keeping North Koreans on the brink of starvation, the nation on the edge of economic collapse, and the global community in a state of anxiety over the country's nuclear program, Kim Jong- il was believed to have suffered a stroke in 2008. Since then, his health was regarded to be in a state of decline.  The North Korean leader's actual death took place two days earlier on Dec. 17, 2011, when Kim Jong-il was reportedly on a train trip -- his preferred means of transportation.  His death was described as being due to ""great mental and physical strain"" as the North Korean leader was participating in a field guidance tour. Known as ""Dear Leader"" to the North Korean people, the rule of Kim Jong- il can well be viewed as one of the remaining ""cults of personality"" in the modern world.

Attention quickly turned to who would fill the power chasm. To that end, the known ""great successor"" to stand at the helm of the country was Kim Jong- un -- the son of Kim Jong-il, whom had been promoted to the rank of general in the Korean People's Army more than a year earlier. At that time in September 2010, the companion news involved Kim Jong- il's sister, Kim Kyong Hui, who had also been promoted and was regarded as a possible caretaker leader after in post- Kim Jong-il era. Of course, in December 2011, there was almost no mention of Kim Kyong Hui; instead, the international media was focused on the little-known Kim Jong-un. Educated in Switzerland and believed to be in his late 20s, Kim Jong Un was Kim Jong-il's third son; Kim Jong-un had been chosen as a successor partially because his disposition was regarded as more suitable for the post of leader than his older brothers.

At home in North Korea, citizens were urged to hold steadfast in their loyalty to Kim Jong-un. North Korean television broadcast images of news anchors, school children, and citizens weeping uncontrollably over the news that the ""Dear Leader"" had passed on.  There were some suggestions by international analysts that the flamboyant expressions of grief over the death of KimJong- il might be contrived unlike the death of the earlier North Korean leader, Kim Sung-il, who had been a beloved figure among the North Korean citizenry.  By contrast, most North Koreans would not be able to divorce their feelings of a long-standing leader from the reality of living in a country where starvation and dire circumstances characterize everyday life.

As the world community wondered about the effects of Kim Jong-il's death on the matter of international security, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported that North Korea test-fired a missile off its eastern coast; South Korean officials apparently believed the missile launch was unrelated to the news ofKim Jong- il's death, although there was no official statement from South Korea's defense ministry.

That being said, South Korea wasted no time placing its armed forces on high alert and the country itself was placed on a crisis footing. Likewise, the government of Japan held an emergency security meeting and expressed hopes that the news of Kim Jong- il's death would not have an ""adverse effect on peace and stability on the peninsula."" The Chinese government expressed distress and ""deep condolences"" over the news, and reaffirmed Beijing's close ties with Pyongyang. From Russia, the foreign ministry said it did not expect changes in bilateral relationship with North Korea. Across the Pacific in the United States, President Barack Obama reportedly discussed the situation with South Korean President Lee Myung-bak and promised that its commitment to stability on the Korean Peninsula remained intact. A statement from the White House read as follows: ""We remain committed to stability on the Korean peninsula, and to the freedom and security of our allies.""

Ironically, news of Kim Jong-il's death came only days after a bilateral deal was forged between the United States and North Korea to exchange 240,000 tons of food from the United States for North Korea's pledge to move towards denuclearization . The agreement was brokered during talks in China between Robert King, United States special envoy on North Korean human rights, and Ri Kun, director general for North American affairs at North Korea's Foreign Ministry, and was intended to set the tone for forthcoming multilateral nuclear negotiations. Six-party talks -- involving North Korea, South Korea, Japan, China, Russia, and the United States -- have stalled since late 2008.

According to South Korea's Yonhap news agency, Washington and Pyongyang ""reached the agreement based on North Korea's pledge to implement initial measures of denuclearization that include a suspension of its uranium-enrichment program."" North Korea, which has been plagued by chronic food shortages, would soon received shipments of food aid, including biscuits and nutritional supplements for infants, rather than rice, which was requested by the North Koreans. United States officials have apparently been concerned that rice would be given to the country's military rather than used to alleviate the dire circumstances of the North Korean general populace.

There was some speculation about the late Kim Jong-il's involvement in  forging this agreement, given the timing of the death announcement.  If Kim Jong-il's health was devolving to the extent that he had died from ""great mental and physical strain,"" then was it possible for him to be involved in such significant negotiations?

Such speculation was only heightened when, on Dec. 20, 2011, South Korean authorities began to express skepticism about the public details pertaining to the death of Kim Jong-il  during a field guidance tour.  Indeed, the leader of South Korea's intelligence service said he had doubts about the time and location of  the North Korean leader's death. National Intelligence Service head, Won Sei-hoon, reportedly told the members of a parliamentary committee that the very train Kim Jong-il used for travel -- and which was supposedly the venue of the North Korean leader's death -- was identified at Pyongyang's train station.  As reported by the Korean Herald, Won Sei-hoon noted, ""There were no signs the train ever moved."" Certainly, if the train was not used for any travel, it was not possible that Kim Jong- il could have died aboard it while participating in the aforementioned field guidance tour, as officially declared by the North Korean authorities.

The quasi-mystery surrounding the actual details of Kim Jong-il's death aside, North Korea was concentrating its efforts on shoring up the image of Kim Jong-un as the undisputed new leader of the secretive communist nation. As reported by the New York Times, North Korean television broadcast images of the country's senior military leaders saluting Kim Jong-un  as he received mourners at a mausoleum, where the body of Kim Jong-il laid in state.  The particular imagery was ostensibly intended to show that Kim Jong-un had gained the allegiance of North Korea's powerful military. Meanwhile, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported that  Kim Jong-un had carried out one of his first measures of supreme power by ordering all North Korean troops to cancel their field exercises and return to their barracks.

His military influence notwithstanding, Kim Jong-un had yet to assume leadership as the general secretary of North Korea's Workers' Party  -- the political power base of the country.  Since 2010, Kim Jung-un held the position of vice chairman of the Central Military Commission of the ruling party.

Ultimately, Kim Jong-un would have to consolidate his power both symbolically and practically, or he could be relegated to a figurehead role at the helm of a ruling  military cadre.  But speculation on that score came to a close at the end of the year when  Kim Jong-un was offically named supreme commander of the country's armed forces. That particular appointment was made in accordance with provisions set forth in Kim Jong-il's will.

It was yet to be seen how Kim Jong-un would relate to international powers, who were  themselves anxious to see North Korea would move substantially in the direction of denuclearization at a time of sensitive geopolitical tensions across the globe. Following the funeral for the late Kim Jong-il on Dec. 28, 2011, state media in North Korea delivered a message from the powerful National Defense Commission of that country making ot clear that there would be no change in foreign policy orientation from Pyongyang in the post Kim Jong-il era.  The statement read as follows: ""We declare solemnly and confidently that the foolish politicians around the world, including the puppet group in South Korea, should not expect any change from us."" Indeed, during the memorial funeral service for Kim Jong-il,  the North Korean head of state, Kim Yong-name made it clear that the country -- now under new leadership -- intended to ""march firmly along the path of Songun taught by great leader Kim Jong-il.""  The term ""Songun"" refers to  North Korea's ""military first"" policy. Clearly, the military imperatives of North Korea would prevail even in the post Kim Jong-il era.

Developments in 2012On Feb. 29, 2012, North Korea formalized its ""denuclearization for food""  agreement with the United States.The terms of the bilateral deal included  the exchange of 240,000 tons of food from the United States for North Korea's pledge to move towards denuclearization.  The agreement included provisions for a North Korean moratorium on nuclear tests, long-range missile launches and uranium enrichment at its Yongbyon nuclear center,  and acceptance of  United Nations inspectors who would monitor the implementation of the terms.  North Korea's acquiescence on this matter  raised the possibility of ending the diplomatic impasse, which had allowed its nuclear program to continue for years without international oversight.

Of course it should be noted that the agreement was not a new one; in fact it first came to light in the days prior to the news of the death of former North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il late in 2011.  The agreement was brokered in December 2011  during talks in China between Robert King, United States special envoy on North Korean human rights, and Ri Kun, director general for North American affairs at North Korea's Foreign Ministry.

At the time, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported that  Washington and Pyongyang ""reached the agreement based on North Korea's pledge to implement initial measures of denuclearization that include a suspension of its uranium-enrichment program"" in exchange for much-needed food. North Korea, which has been plagued by chronic food shortages, would soon received shipments of food aid, including biscuits and nutritional supplements for infants, rather than rice, which was requested by the North Koreans. United States officials have apparently been concerned that rice would be given to the country's military rather than used to alleviate the dire circumstances of the North Korean general populace.

The agreement  was intended to set the tone for forthcoming multilateral nuclear negotiations. Six-party talks -- involving North Korea, South Korea, Japan, China, Russia, and the United States -- have stalled since late 2008.For its part, the United States welcomed the North Koreans' movement on the breakthrough deal, deeming it ""important, if limited.""  The United States Department of State spokeswoman, Victoria Nuland, took a cautiously optimistic saying,  ""The United States still has profound concerns regarding North Korean behavior across a wide range of areas, but today's announcement reflects important, if limited, progress in addressing some of these.""

Striking a similar tone, the director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Yukiya Amano, characterized the announcement ""an important step forward."" He continued, ""Pending further details, we stand ready to return to Yongbyon to undertake monitoring activities upon request and with the agreement of the agency's board of governors.""In the aftermath of a  ""denuclearization for food"" agreement with the United States, there were high hopes that the deal would facilitate progress in multilateral negotiations on North Korea's nuclear program.  Those high hopes were somewhat dashed by news that North Korea intended to launch a satellite into orbit.

Pyongyang announced on March 16, 2011, that it would launch an ""earth observation"" satellite, or the Kwangmyongsong-3, using a long-range rocket.  The event was intended  to mark the 100th birthday of its late leader Kim Il-Sung.  Of course, such a move would be contrary to the prevailing United Nations resolutions, which prohibits North Korea's use of long-range intercontinental ballistic missile technology,  as well as the aforementioned ""denuclearization for food"" agreement, the latter of which requires North Korea to adhere to a moratorium on nuclear tests and long-range missile launches.

Not surprisingly, all the other countries involved in multilateral negotiations -- South Korea, Japan, China, Russia, and the United States -- expressed dismay over this plan by North Korea.  United States Department of State spokesperson, Nuland,  pointed to this concurrence and urged North Korea to rethink the satellite launch saying, ""Obviously, we were heartened that every single one of the six-party talks participants made clear that they think that this would be an extremely bad idea and a violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions, so we are hoping and expecting that the DPRK will take that to heart.""  The United States also noted it would be ""very hard"" to go forward with its planned food assistance if North Korea moved ahead with the plan to launch a satellite into orbit.

The geopolitical complexity of the Korean peninsula became more complicated on March 21, 2012, when the White House in the United States announced that President Barack Obama intended to visit to the world's most heavily militarized border -- the  Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ).  The White House explained that the trip to the DMZ was intended  to convey the president's support  for the  30,000 United States troops stationed in South Korea, and to augment bilateral relations between Washington and Seoul.  In a press briefing, Daniel Russel, Asia director for the White House National Security Council, said: ""The DMZ is the front line of democracy in the Korean Peninsula, and it's the symbol of the U.S. and [South Korean] resolve, as well as solidarity. So a visit by the president there to see and to thank the U.S. and the South Korean service members makes perfect sense.""

After his visit to the DMZ, President Obama was set to attend a global summit  aimed at reducing the risk of nuclear terrorism in the South Korean capital of Seoul.  Ahead of the Nuclear Security Summit, President Obama reiterated his call for  ""a world without nuclear weapons"" and advanced his foreign policy agenda that advocates  non-proliferation and the reduction of  nuclear weapons through increase diplomacy.

In a speech to students at South Korea's Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, President Obama said the United States -- the only nation to have ever used nuclear weapons -- was fully committed to  reducing its stockpile of nuclear arms.  The United States leader said his country had a""moral obligation"" to pursue strategic arms cuts.  President Obama also drew thunderous applause from the audience of students when he said that, as a father, he did not wish to see his daughters growing up in a world with nuclear threats. 

""I say this as president of the only nation ever to use nuclear weapons,"" Obama said. ""I say it as a commander in chief who knows that our nuclear codes are never far from my side. Most of all, I say it as a father, who wants my two young daughters to grow up in a world where everything they know and love can't be instantly wiped out.""

President Obama acknowledged his country's unique position in the world, but he noted that ""serious sustained global effort"" was needed to achieve his expressed hope for a nuclear weapons-free world.

The issue of nuclear proliferation has been at the forefront of the international purview given the ongoing concerns about North Korea's nuclear arsenal.  Addressing the matter of North Korea's nuclear ambitions, President Obama made it clear that the United States held ""no hostile intent"" to that country, but warned that there would be ""no rewards for provocation.""

The United States president said:  ""The United States has no hostile intent toward your country...We are committed to peace. And we are prepared to take steps to improve relations, which is why we have offered nutritional aid to North Korean mothers and children.""  President Obama continued, ""But by now it should be clear, your provocations and pursuit of nuclear weapons have not achieved the security you seek -- they have undermined it. Instead of the dignity you desire, you're more isolated. Instead of earning the respect of the world, you've been met with strong sanctions and condemnation. You can continue down the road you are on, but we know where that leads. It leads to more of the same -- more broken dreams, more isolation, ever more distance between the people of North Korea and the dignity and the opportunity that they deserve.""

President Obama reiterated the warning already issued by his government that the long-range missile launch to place a satellite in orbit would only result in isolation for Pyongyang.He said,  ""With respect to North Korea, we are going to be both sending messages to North Korea that they should not go forward with this missile launch, which would violate existing U.N. Security Council resolutions. And our hope is, is that we can resolve these issues diplomatically.""President Obama also joined South Korean President Lee Myung-bak in noting that North Korea would be subject to further sanctions if it did not cancel its launch plans. Making clear the options available for North Korea, President Obama addressed the leadership of that country saying, ""You can continue with the road you are on but we know where that leads...Today, we say: Pyongyang, have the courage to pursue peace.""For his part,  Kim Jong Un -- North Korea's new leader -- appeared to be following his father's footsteps in the realm of rhetoric as he deemed the  nuclear summit to be  ""a childish farce.""  Earlier, Pyongyang asserted that  denunciations of North Korea  would amount to a ""declaration of war.""

Pyongyang was also signaling that it had no intention of pulling back from its missile launch to sent a satellite into orbit. Instead,  South Korean sources were reporting that North Korea  moved a long-range rocket to a launch pad close to the Chinese border.  As well, satellite imagery appeared to depict preparations for the launch, which Pyongyang had said would take place between April 12-16, 2012.  The guidance was that the rocket would follow a  trajectory that would take it close to south-western Japan.

Accordingly, Japan's defense ministry made it clear that it had ordered the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) to intercept North Korea's rocket launch, if necessary, using its missile shield.  Japanese authorities also alerted rescue personnel that they would be mobilized to deal with potential disasters, should the  veer off course. Already, the South Korean government had said that it would  shoot down any North Korean rocket that strayed into its territory. As well, the United States was sea-based X-band radar into the Pacific to monitor the launch. Upset about the prospect of rocket debris affecting countries of the Pacific, President Benigno Aquino III of the Philippines called on Pyongyang to abandon the launch plans.

It should be noted that the Obama administration in the United States canceled its food aid program to North Korea due to that country's decision to move forward with the satellite launch.  An official from the Pentagon was cited as saying: ""Why we're not providing that food assistance at this point is because our confidence in their ability to meet their agreements has been diminished. We do not use it as a lever to change their policies.""

A week ahead of the timeline expected for the North Korean missile launch, President Kim Jong Un warned that any country that dared to interfere with its plans  would face ""immediate, resolute and merciless punishment.""  In a statement published by  the Korean Central News Agency, the North Korean leader asserted: ""(Any country that) intercepts the satellite or collects its debris will meet immediate, resolute and merciless punishment.""  Pyongyang also warned South Korea against intercepting the rocket booster, should it stray into South Korean territorial waters.  Pyongyang promised that an interception by Seoul would bring about ""the end of everything in South Korea.""

On April 10, 2012, the United States was reiterating its warnings to North Korea that the launch of a new missile would be ""a clear and serious violation"" of international agreements.  White House press secretary Jay Carney said in an interview with journalists: ""The proposed missile launch, if conducted, would represent a clear and serious violation of North Korea's obligations under two United Nations Security Council resolutions that explicitly prohibit North Korea from testing ballistic missiles.""  Carney said the United States intended to work allied countries on implementing consequences for North Korea, should it proceed with its provocative missile launch; Carney noted that United States food aid to North Korea could be cut off.

By April 13, 2012, news emerged from North Korea that although that country attempted to launch its satellite into space, the long-range rocket failed to reach orbit.  Despite the spectacular failure of the mission, the attempted action was nonetheless widely condemned by the international community.  Notably, members of the Group of Eight industrial nation states issued a joint condemnation, noting that the launch was in clear violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions prohibiting intercontinental missile deployments.

In a related development, South Korean officials were noting that new satellite imagery suggests that North Korea was preparing to carry out a nuclear test. The imagery depicted piles of earth and sand at the entrance of a tunnel at a nuclear site, where previous nuclear bomb testing was carried out in 2006 and 2009.  An anonymous source was quoted by Agence France Presse as saying: ""Recent satellite images led us to conclude the North has been secretly digging a new underground tunnel in the nuclear test site... besides two others where the previous tests were conducted.""  Given the aforementioned launch failure, there were some suggestions that North Korea might try to ""save face"" by moving forward with an even more provocative act -- quite possibly, a nuclear test.  Of course, such an act would be regarded as a clear move down the path of confrontation by North Korea's regional neighbors as well as Western powers.

By the third week of April 2012, presumably as a cautionary move, South Korea  announced that it had deployed missiles with a range of 625 miles. The weapons would be able to strike nuclear targets inside North Korea.

As April 2012 entered its final week, North Korea was ratcheting up the militaristic rhetoric as it threatened to  initiate military action against South Korean targets and characterized South Korean President Lee Myung-bak a ""traitor"" and ""scum."" In a statement, Pyongyang issued the following threat: ""The special actions of our revolutionary armed forces will start soon to meet the reckless challenge of the group of traitors.  Once the … special actions kick off, they will reduce all the rat-like groups and the bases for provocations to ashes in 3 or 4 minutes ... by unprecedented peculiar means and methods of our own style.""

Meanwhile, reports suggested that North Korea was close to completing preparations for a  nuclear test. This move -- if successful -- would constitute North Korea's third nuclear test after two in 2006 and 2009. The global community was watching events unfold in North Korea closely as  Pyongyang may now have the capacity to conduct a test using highly enriched uranium for the very first time.  This development would presage North Korea's possible ability to  significantly build up its stocks of weapons-grade nuclear material.  As well, it would facilitate the manufacture of a nuclear warhead to mount on a long-range missile.  Should North Korea go forward with its third nuclear test, it would be a clear example of the limits of China's influence on the paranoid  regime ruling North Korea today.On July 25, 2012, news emerged from North Korea that the country's new leader, Kim Jong-un, was  married to a woman seen in his company at a number of public events. North Korean state media finally confirmed that the country's leader Kim Jong-un was married and identified the leader's spouse as  ""Comrade Ri Sol-ju.""  There was no sense of when their marriage actually took place, although South Korean media suggested it was not a new development. The news of the marital status of the North Korean president, who succeeded his father Kim Jong-il at the start of the year, came weeks after a military shakeup. The military shuffle was interpreted as an attempt by Kim Jong-un to place his own stamp of authority on North Korea's most powerful institution.  Now, with news of his marriage being made public and given his public appearances with his wife, some analysts were additionally suggesting that the new North Korean leader was also trying to establish his own, more accessible, image in the North Korean context.

That accessible image, however, did not necessarily augur a reformist inclination in the realm of government and politics.  As July 2012 drew to a close, Pyongyang dismissed the notion of reform. A spokesperson for North Korea's Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea, which directs relations with South Korea, put the idea of reform to rest, insisting that Kim Jong-un would maintain the ""military first"" policy of his father, the late Kim Jong-il. The spokesperson also spoke derisively of reports of possible changes in orientation from the North, which had emanated from the South, saying: ""The puppet group (South Korea)... tried to give (the) impression that the present leadership of the DPRK (North Korea) broke with the past. This is the height of ignorance. To expect policy change and reform and opening from the DPRK is nothing but a foolish and silly dream, just like wanting the sun to rise in the west."" On Jan. 1, 2013, North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un, delivered arare new year's message on state television.  His address -- the first new year's  speech in almost two decades --  focused on the imperatives of economic development and reunification of the two Koreas.  The call for a unified Korea came only weeks after Park Geun-hye was elected as the first female president of South Korea.  In power since 2011 himself, Kim Jong-un may have been attempting to establish better relations with South Korea, which was now coming under new leadership itself.  Notably, Kim Jong-un warned that confrontation had only resulting in war. That being said, he continued to emphasize the military element as a national priority for North Korea. To that end, he said: ""The military might of a country represents its national strength. Only when it builds up its military might in every way can it develop into a thriving country.""  Of course, North Korea has long been suffering from a famine and only a month prior (s discussed below) carried out a long-range rocket launch that was certain to elicit consequences from the United Nations  Security Council. Meanwhile, at the start of December 2012, North Korea announced plans to carry out a new satellite launch.  A failed attempt to launch an ""earth observation"" satellite ensued in April 2012 when the long-range rocket crashed into the sea after traveling only a short distance.Now, in December 2012, North Korea was planning to launch a second version of Kwangmyongsong-3 (called the Unha-3) into space from the Sohae Space Center in  North Phyongan Province. The official North Korean state news agency said the satellite launch was set to occur roughly between Dec. 10, 2012, and Dec. 22, 2012. The United States issued a warning that the long-range missile launch to place a satellite in orbit  would threaten global peace and security, and  only result in isolation for Pyongyang. The United States also noted, as it did in April 2012, that such a move would be contrary to the prevailing United Nations resolutions, which prohibits North Korea's use of long-range intercontinental ballistic missile technology.  In a written statement, United States Department of State spokesperson Victoria Nuland declared:  ""A North Korean 'satellite' launch would be a highly provocative act that threatens peace and security in the region...Any North Korean launch using ballistic missile technology is in direct violation of UN Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs) 1718 and 1874.""  Nuland also noted that her country would be consulting with key partner countries, such as South Korea, Japan, China, and Russia, to discuss further steps in regards to these proposed moves by North Korea.  By Dec. 7. 2012, there were more signs that the rocket launch plan was going forward as fuel-injection work  was reported to be taking place, according to South Korean media. Days earlier on Dec. 4, 2012, North Korea confirmed its plans to go forward with the rocket launch as it conveyed plans to the International Maritime Organization -- the United Nations' shipping agency.  Typically, such notification to the International Maritime Organization in such instances. Further details about the launch were released including the news that the three-stage rocket was expected to fly on a southward path and would drop into the sea off the west coast of South Korea, ultimately  landing in waters to the east of the Philippines. Since the flight path would take the rocket close to Japan's Okinawa island, the government of Japan was  positioning missile defense interceptors in order to be prepared  for the rocket charting off course.  It should be noted that this long-range rocket has sufficient range to reach the western part of the United States.  On Dec. 9, 2012, North Korean authorities announced that the rocket launch -- due to take place between Dec. 10, 2012 and Dec. 22, 2012 -- was being delayed due to technical difficulties.  However, by Dec. 11, 2012, those technical difficulties were apparently resolved as international news media outlets reported that North Korea had fired its long-range Unha-3 rocket rocket from its west coast. According to the South Korean Yonhap News Agency, some debris from the rocket fell into waters off the Philippines after passing over the Japanese city of Okinawa, consistent with the expected trajectory.  The firing of the rocket was supposedly  intended to launch a satellite into space.  North Korea announced that its goal had been achieved and a satellite was placed in orbit.The North Korean state news agency claimed success in its goal, declaring: ""The launch of the second version of our Kwangmyongsong-3 [Unha-3] satellite from the Sohae Space Centre... on December 12 was successful. The satellite has entered the orbit as planned.""It should be noted that while United States officials confirmed there was an object launched into orbit, it also noted that the object appeared to be wobbling off course.  South Korean defense sources had a somewhat different view and suggested that the satellite  was not necessarily  wobbling off course or out of control.  The South Koreans said that the satellite may have been intended to be in a circular orbit but was instead an elliptical orbit.There were also some questions about the level of success achieved in this exercise by the North Koreans.  Some experts, such as Vassily Mikheev of Russia's Institute for World Economy and International Relations, have pointed to the fact that North Korean engineers used old technology to launch the satellite into orbit. Mikheev noted that Scud technology  was intended for small missiles, and therefore  not particularly reliable  for firing a three-phased operation.Of course, the conventional wisdom was that the entire exercise was a pretense, and intended to demonstrate North Korea's technological capacity to deliver a nuclear warhead on a intercontinental ballistic missile.Regardless of actual motivation, the move by North Korea was made in defiance of international warnings that Pyongyang refrain from such provocative activity, and certainly in clear violation of prevailing United Nations Security Council resolutions.  Accordingly, the United Nations Security Council wasted no time in condemning North Korea for its actions, and making note that the launch was""a clear violation of Security Council resolutions.""  China -- North Korea's closest ally -- expressed ""regret"" over North Korea's decision to fire the rocket while calling for restraint on the part of the international community in response.  But  the United States was already  warning that Pyongyang would face consequences for its ""highly provocative act that threatens regional security.""  There were suggestions that a new resolution by the United Nations Security Council was in the offing, but with China's position on such a measure unknown.Meanwhile, all expectations were that North Korea was likely going to carry out a nuclear test.  In 2009, following a rocket launch that year, North Korea carried out its second ever nuclear test.North Korea's first nuclear test was carried out in 2006.  Two rounds of sanctions were imposed on North Korea in response to those provocative actions. Now, with another rocket launch accomplished, it was anticipated that North Korea would again follow that path and carry out a third nuclear test. Of course, it should be noted that North Korea was pursuing expensive  nuclear development and rocket delivery technology even as most of its population lived in a state of abject poverty.  Thus, the notion of further economic sanctions was unlikely to deter the paranoid and reclusive regime, which has long privileged its military agenda ahead of domestic concerns.

2013 Special Report:    North Korea - A Threat to Global Security?   Summary:   On Feb. 12, 2013, North Korea carried out its third nuclear test, earning the wide and vociferous condemnation of the international community.  North Korea cast the test as a restrained response and warned of further actions in the face of ""U.S. hostility.""  The nuclear test was not unexpected, coming on the heels of a rocket launch in December 2012, which led to the United Nations'  early 2013 decision to tighten sanctions against North Korea.  North Korea under its new leader, Kim-Jong-un, has increased the anxiety of the international community by intensifying its rhetoric and threatening even more provocative actions.   In the face of such provocation, the United Nations Security Council  convened an emergency meeting to consider measures against North Korea -- a country that has, to date, been undeterred by international action or prevailing international law.  Indeed, the very existence of sanctions has not stopped North Korea from repeatedly violating the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.  North Korea's lack of concern for international opinion was displayed in high relief in mid-February 2013 when the state-controlled newspaper declared the country's need for intercontinental ballistic missiles.  Anxieties over global security reached new heights as news reports began to emerge about Iran playing a role in North Korea's nuclear development program.   In March 2013,  the United Nations Security Council acted against North Korea by  unanimously adopting Resolution 2094, which censured North Korea for its February 2013 nuclear test and imposing an even stricter sanctions regime on that country. At that time, tensions were increasing on the Korean peninsular, with North Korea using sharp rhetoric to issue threats against South Korea, even ending its armistice with the South that brought an end to the hostilities between the two Koreas, and ultimately declaring it was in ""a state of war"" with South Korea.  North Korea also cut off its emergency hotline with South Korea; by April 2013, North Korea  decided to re-open its nuclear complex at Yongbyon  and ceased border crossing access for South Koreans into the jointly-administered Kaesong industrial zone, which has often been viewed as a symbol of cross-border cooperation. North Korea, meanwhile, declared its enmity with the United States, warning that strikes on American interests might be in the offing, and pointing to United States military interests in Japan and Guam, presumably indicated they might be on Pyongyang's target list.  The North Korean military additionally claimed to have ""ratified"" a possible attack on the United States.   

But by May 2013, the political climate appeared to have cooled and North Korea withdrew  two intermediate range missiles it had placed earlier on its east coast.  Nevertheless,  North Korea went onto to carry out four short range missile tests in mid-May 2013.  It was not known if North Korea was trying to re-ignite geo-political tensions or if the tests were routine exercises intended to simply show military might.  A month later in June 2013, there was a bizarre mix of progress and retreat on the diplomatic front as the two Koreas  planned and then cancelled bilateral negotiations; however, North Korea then proposed direct talks with the United States.In August  2013 through September 2013, the two Koreas finally agreed to re-open operations at the jointly-administered Kaesong industrial zone. But in the second week of September 2013, signs pointed to the fact that operations were being restarted at North Korea's Yongbyon reactor.  It seemed that regardless of calming of tensions, North Korea was going forward with the threat made in April 2013 about re-opening its Yongbyon facility.Background:On Jan. 22, 2013,  the United Nations Security Council unanimously approved a resolution authorizing tighter sanctions against North Korea over its December 2012 rocket launch, which  at the time spurred international condemnation.North Korea angrily responded  to the move by promising further rocket launches and nuclear testing, and also warning of retribution against the United States, which it described as a ""sworn enemy.""  The following statement was issued via the official Korean Central News Agency: ""We do not hide that a variety of satellites and long-range rockets will be launched and a nuclear test of higher level will be carried out in the upcoming new phase of the anti-U.S. struggle, targeting against the U.S., the sworn enemy of the Korean people.""  Pyongyang soon expanded its threats to note that it would take action against South Korea if it participated in the United Nations sanctions regime.  China's  official Xinhua News Agency also reported that Pyongyang intended to walk away from multilateral six-part talks since ""the U.N. Security Council has been reduced into an organization bereft of impartiality and balance.""North Korea has not been a stranger to strong rhetoric, and since the December 2012 rocket launch, all expectations were that North Korea would follow its previous pattern of behavior and carry out a nuclear test.  To that end, South Korea's Yonhap News referenced  South Korean intelligence sources in reporting that North Korea had completed technical preparations for a nuclear test.  Thus, the nuclear test and belligerent threats against the United States  and South Korea were, in many senses, not surprising reactions from North Korea.  The decision to brand the United Nations Security Council an impartial entity and walk away from multilateral talks was perhaps the more unexpected path taken by Pyongyang, since China -- North Korea's closest ally -- is a veto-wielding member of that body.But  by the end of January 2013, North Korea took its rhetoric to another level when it promised action at an even ""higher level"" than a nuclear test.  The position of the North Korean leadership was reported in the Rodong Sinmun state newspaper as follows:  ""It is the people's demand that we should do something, not just a nuclear test, but something even greater. The U.N. Security Council has left us no room for choice.""This bellicose language continued in February 2013 when  Pyongyang again threatened ""stronger measures""  than simply a third nuclear test in response to ""hostile"" sanctions by the international community.  A statement by North Korea's state news agency read as follows: ""The DPRK (Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea, or North Korea) has drawn a final conclusion that it will have to take a measure stronger than a nuclear test to cope with the hostile forces nuclear war moves that have become ever more undisguised.""  There was no indication as to what form those ""stronger measures"" might entail although there was some suggestion that North Korea might use enriched weapons grade uranium, rather than plutonium,  in an explosion of some sort.The use of uranium  could indicate North Korea's intent to expand its nuclear arsenal through uranium enrichment.It would also incur a high level of risk.  As noted by  Siegfried Hecker, former director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico  and a professor at Stanford University in California, in  Foreign Policy magazine: ""If a next test is well contained, then we may learn nothing about the device. However, one of the risks Pyongyang takes in trying to demonstrate a test at a higher level is that they may produce fissures that allow radioactive seepage or possibly cause a major blowout from the tunnel.""North Korea's bellicose language was matched with provocative visual imagery.  At issue was the release of a  three-minute video on YouTube depicting a North Korean man's dream sequence in which the city of New York is destroyed, with the 1985 song ""We are the world"" playing in the background.A caption, which was translated from Korean in The Guardian newspaper, reads as follows: ""Somewhere in the United States, black clouds of smoke are billowing.  It seems that the nest of wickedness is ablaze with the fire started by itself.""It continues:  ""Despite attempts by imperialists to isolate and crush us … never will anyone be able to stop the people marching towards a final victory."" The video was reported to have been released by  North Korea's state-run media and while of amateur quality in some regards, it nonetheless represented a sharp threat against the United States and/or the interests of its allies.Two dates that North Korea might be considering for a nuclear test were Feb. 16, 2013, the birthday of former leader, Kim Jong-il, or Feb. 25, 2013, the inauguration date of Park Geun-hye of South Korea.North Korea's third nuclear testOn Feb. 12, 2013, seismic activity in North Korea suggested that officials may have selected an even earlier date to go forward with a third nuclear test.  The seismic shock activity emanated from the same area where North Korea had conducted its 2006 and 2009 nuclear tests. Kim Min-seok of the South Korean Defense Ministry indicated that country's belief, saying, ""We believe that North Korea has conducted a nuclear test.""  Meanwhile, the United States Geological Survey indirectly confirmed that the test had taken place as it noted the shock appeared to be one kilometer underground and was consistent with a nuclear blast.  According to Lassina Zerbo, the director of the international data center of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test Ban Treaty Organization, the magnitude of the test was twice as large as the 2009 nuclear test.  It should be noted that initial reports suggested the use of  plutonium in this nuclear test, which tends to be suited for use as a missile warhead.North Korea itself soon confirmed that it had carried out  its third underground nuclear test, which it said involved a ""miniaturized"" nuclear device. As reported in a statement by the state-run  KCNA news agency: ""It was confirmed that the nuclear test that was carried out at a high level in a safe and perfect manner using a miniaturized and lighter nuclear device with greater explosive force than previously did not pose any negative impact on the surrounding ecological environment.""North Korea claimed its third nuclear test  was an act of self-defense against ""U.S. hostility"" and warned that further  moves might be in the offing.  Via the state-controlled KCNA news agency, Pyongyang claimed  that the nuclear test  ""was only the first response"" taken ""with maximum restraint.""  Pyongyang warned that further actions were in the offing, saying: ""If the United States continues to come out with hostility and complicates the situation, we will be forced to take stronger, second and third responses in consecutive steps.""International ResponseThe chorus of condemnation from the international community was broad and vociferous. United Nations  Secretary General Ban Ki-moon wasted no time in condemning North Korea's nuclear test, which he emphasized was a ""clear and grave violation"" of United Nations resolutions. NATO cast the nuclear test as an ""irresponsible act"" that posed a serious threat to world peace.  Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov demanded that North Korea  abandon its nuclear program and return to the negotiating table. China, North Korea's closest ally, demanded an audience with the North Korean ambassador in Beijing, while Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi said China was ""strongly dissatisfied and resolutely opposed"" to the nuclear test.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe declared the nuclear test to be a ""grave threat"" and vowed that it could not be tolerated.  In a statement, United States President Barack Obama argued for a swift response, asserting: ""The danger posed by North Korea's threatening activities warrants further swift and credible action by the international community. The United States will also continue to take steps necessary to defend ourselves and our allies.""  But perhaps the most scathing response came from Denmark's  Foreign Minister Villy Sovndal, who said: ""This [nuclear test] deserves only one thing and that is a one-sided condemnation.  North Korea is likely the most horrible country on this planet.""The United Nations Security Council convened an emergency meeting later on Feb. 12, 2013 to discuss future measures. During that meeting, the permanent and rotating member nations of the United Nations Security Council  unanimously condemned North Korea's latest nuclear test and warned that ""appropriate measures"" would be in the offing.Clearly, North Korea would be faced with the prospects of international action.  Even its closest ally, China, via its state-controlled media, had urged North Korea not to go forward with such a provocative action  and warned that North Korea would pay a ""heavy price""  if it proceeded with the test.  Of course, in the realm of international jurisprudence, heavy costs have come in the form of harsh sanctions by the United Nations Security Council, which have done little to curtail North Korea from going forward with its missile  program and nuclear development agenda.  Indeed, the very existence of sanctions has not stopped North Korea from repeatedly violating the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.Belligerence and BrinkmanshipNorth Korea's lack of concern for international opinion was displayed in high relief when the state-controlled newspaper declared the country's need for intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).  Only two days after carrying out  its third nuclear test, North Korea displayed its brazen stance by declaring that it should own ICBMs since the  ""imperialists""  -- an apparent reference to the United States -- had a nuclear arsenal. According to a review in Rodong Sinmun, North Korea's main newspaper and an apparent mouthpiece for the North Korean government --  the country required ICBMs to augment its self-defense.  The article in Rodong Sinmun also declared that North Korea would be a formidable enemy in the face of adversity or any challenge, and warned that there ""can be no compromise in the last fight to herald the victory for independence for humanity.""  The diatribe also included the promise to  ""strike a blow to end imperialism.""The North Koreans' efforts to develop  ICBM capacity were apparently  not being undertaken in isolation. According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, there  were suggestions that the Iranians might be assisting the North Koreans with the development of a rocket program.  Blog 38  at Johns Hopkins University noted that its analysis of satellite imagery taken in early 2013 showed that  preparations were being made for an impending test of a liquid-fueled rocket.  That satellite imagery  further showed that North Korea could conceivably test rockets larger than the size of the rocket deployed in late 2012 from a new launch pad.  As stated in the report published in Blog 38: ""Analysis of construction activities around the new launch pad has revealed evidence that Pyongyang's rocket program may be receiving assistance from Iran.""Since Iran was already ensconced its its own controversial nuclear development program -- to the great consternation of the international community -- the news of a possible connection between Pyongyang and Tehran was being  met with alarm across the world.  Indeed, there was a growing sense of anxiety about global security as a result.  That being said, the general consensus was that North Korea had not, to date,  developed the ability to deploy a nuclear warhead on an ICBM.In the last week of February 2013, researchers at Johns Hopkins University -- via  Blog 38 -- said that satellite imagery of the nuclear test facility show possible signs of human activity there, even after the third nuclear test.  They suggested that North Korea might be preparing for a fourth nuclear test.  As stated in Blog 38: ""It remains unclear whether renewed activity at the site is normal for the days after a nuclear detonation or if it is an indication of Pyongyang's intention to conduct another test in the near future.""  Sources from the Chinese government suggested that Pyongyang was waiting for possible action from the United Nations Security Council  before it makes a decision ona fourth nuclear test.ConsequencesWith news circulating in the first week of March 2013  that a draft  of a United Nations Security Council resolution against North Korea had been crafted, Pyongyang wasted little time in registering its anger.  On March 5, 2013, North Korea warned that it would end its 1953 armistice (ceasefire) that brought a conclusion to the conflict with South Korea, without officially ending the Korean War.  North Korea also demanded that the United States and South Korea end its ongoing military drills in the region, referring to them as a ""dangerous nuclear war targeted at us.""  Furthermore, the Korean People's Army warned that it would carry out stronger actions  in response to the ""hostile"" policies of the United States and South Korea. It was apparent that North Korea was prepared to take an aggressive stance in the face of international pressure.On March 7, 2013, the United Nations Security Council unanimous adopted Resolution 2094 censuring North Korea for its February  nuclear test and imposing an even stricter sanctions regime on that country.Included in those new sanctions were provisions to target the financing sources of North Korea's nuclear and missile technology, but there were additional penalties imposed on North Korea in the realm of banking, travel, transportation,  and trade.As stated by United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Susan Rice, ""The strength, breadth and severity of these sanctions will raise the cost to North Korea of its illicit nuclear program. Taken together, these sanctions will bite and bite hard.""  South Korea's Ambassador to the United Nations, Kim Sook, said the time had come for North Korea to ""wake up from its delusion"" of becoming a nuclear state. He continued, ""It can either take the right path toward a bright future and prosperity, or it can take a bad road toward further and deeper isolation and eventual self-destruction.""  Meanwhile,  United Nations  Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the unanimous adoption of the resolution delivered a strong message to North Korea that its pursuit of nuclear weapons would not be tolerated by the international community.In  addition to scrapping its non-aggression agreements with South Korea, North Korea responded to the news of international action by saying that it would be  cutting off the North-South hot-line. Installed in 1971, the hot-line was created to provide direct communication at  times of increased tensions and also to organize the transfer of persons and goods through the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone.  Clearly, the disabling of the hot-line was not only symbolic of the breakdown in bilateral relations between the two Koreas, there were also practical and security implications.It should be noted that North Korea has also shockingly threatened to  launch pre-emptive nuclear attacks on the United States and South Korea in response to the joint military drills, which it said were proof of the United States' intent to go to war.  A belligerent North Korea said via its Foreign Ministry that the United Nations' action would ""compel"" that country to take ""countermeasures"" in short order.Furthermore, it declared in a statement: ""Now that the U.S. is set to light a fuse for a nuclear war, the revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK will exercise the right to a pre-emptive nuclear attack to destroy the strongholds of the aggressors and to defend the supreme interests of the country."" North Korea even threatened to transformWashington and Seoul into ""a sea in flames"" with ""lighter and smaller nukes.""For its part, South Korea was undeterred and moving forward with the very joint military drills (with the United States) that earned outrage and threats from Pyongyang. Still, South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se said on March 11, 2013, that his country would try to re-engage with North Korea with an eye on shifting the climate from tension and threats to cooperation. In an address, Yun said his goal was to ""turn this era of confrontation and mistrust into an era of trust and cooperation with North Korea.""  Yun further asserted: ""The security situation on the Korean Peninsula for now is very grave as the unpredictability surrounding North Korea is rising following its third nuclear test.""Escalating TensionsAs March 2013 was drawing to a close, North Korea increased its belligerent rhetoric and said that missile and artillery units were combat-ready and aimed at United States and South Korean targets.  In a statement broadcast on the  state-controlled Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), the Korean People's Army's Supreme Command said: ""From this moment, the Supreme Command puts all of its field artillery including strategic rocket units and long-range artillery units into the No. 1 combat ready  posture.""  The statement further delineated targets in South Korea and the United States -- from its military installations in the Pacific to Hawaii and the mainland.  Indeed, a North Korean spokesperson was on the record saying, ""The U.S. should not forget that the Anderson Air Force Base on Guam, where B-52s take off, and naval bases in Japan proper and Okinawa, where nuclear-powered submarines are launched, are within the striking range of [North Korea's] precision strike means.""  North Korea said that its motivation was driven by the priority ""to safeguard our sovereignty and the highest dignity [of leader Kim Jong Un] through military actions.""The United States responded with its own statement as follows: ""North Korea's bellicose rhetoric and threats follow a pattern designed to raise tensions and intimidate others. While the United Nations Command, Combined Forces Command and U.S. Forces Korea continue to maintain the armistice, North Korea continues its provocative behavior and rhetoric. The Republic of Korea-U.S. alliance is strong and we remain committed to the defense of [South Korea].""Then, on March 30, 2013, North Korea declared it was in a ""state of war"" with South Korea and that its the long-standing truce with the South had ended.  A statement from Pyongyang read as follows: ""From this time on, the North-South relations will be entering the state of war and all issues raised between the North and South will be handled accordingly. The long-standing situation of the Korean peninsula being neither at peace nor at war is finally over.""In response, the South Korean defense ministry denounced the war threat and issued its own statement, which read as follows: ""Our military is maintaining full preparedness to leave no blind point in safeguarding the lives and safety of the people.""  As well, South Korean President Park Geun-hye noted that her country was taking the  threats from North Korea ""very seriously.""  She said, ""If there is any provocation against South Korea and its people, there should be a strong response in initial combat without any political considerations.""For its part, the United States military command in South Korea dispatched a statement that read as follows:  ""North Korea will achieve nothing by threats or provocations, which will only further isolate North Korea and undermine international efforts to ensure peace and stability in Northeast Asia.""Matching its words  with concrete illustrations, the United States was also displaying its military versatility by deploying B-2 and B-52 planes with nuclear capabilities over South Korea, while also flying F-22 Raptor fighter jets from Japan to South Korea's Osan Air base. As well, as noted below, the United States said it would deploy additional ballistic-missile interceptors along the country's Pacific Coast, with an eye on protecting the United States from a potential attack from North Korea.  As well, the United States  moved its  sea-based  X-Band radar platform, normally based in Hawaii, closer to the North Korean coast, with the intent of monitoring  potential attempts from North Korea to launch a long-range missile.  By April 2013, the United States  additionally decided to deploy an anti-missile system to Guam.Tensions on the Korean Peninsular escalated on April 2, 2013 when  the state-controlled Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) of the North Korea announced that it would be re-opening its main nuclear complex at Yongbyon and restarting its nuclear reactor there.The Yongbyon complex was home to both a uranium enrichment facility and a nuclear reactor; it  was closed as a part of a 2007 agreement between North Korea and a multilateral cadre, including China and the United States.  The agreement mandated the closure of the reactor at Yongbyon  in lieu of one million metric tons of heavy fuel oil as well as humanitarian aid benefits.The agreement was only really in effect for a couple of years since  North Korea resumed the reprocessing of  fuel rods stored at the site in 2009, complaining that it did not receive the desired level of energy assistance.This 2013 decision to open the Yongbyon complex and restart operations of the nuclear reactor was illustrative of  the intensification of dissonance on the Korean peninsular ongoing since late 2012.  But it was also a disturbing development as it showed that the new leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un, was prepared to take increasingly provocative actions.  As a result, the international community was now regarding the paranoid and alienated nation state of nuclearized North Korea through the valence of anxiety.Reflecting this sentiment, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he was ""deeply dismayed"" by North Korea's decision to re-open the main nuclear complex at Yongbyon and restart the nuclear reactor.  He further condemned the provocative actions declaring: ""The current crisis has already gone too far. Nuclear threats are not a game. Aggressive rhetoric and military posturing only result in counter-actions, and fuel fear and instability.""Secretary General Ban urged all partied to engage in urgent talks as  ""the only way to resolve the current crisis."" However, with North Korea cutting off its military hot-line with South Korea, canceling its armistice with that country,  using the rhetoric of war, and re-opening its Yongbyon facility, it seemed that authorities in Pyongyang were not in the mood for productive diplomatic engagement.Indeed, a day later on April 3, 2013,  North Korea has ceased border crossing access for South Koreans into the jointly-administered Kaesong industrial zone. Since Kaesong has been viewed as a tacit symbol of the state of geopolitical relations and the last significant arena of cooperation between the two Koreas, the cessation of cross-border access at the industrial zone was regarded as a disturbing development.By April 4, 2013, the state-controlled Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said the military had ""ratified"" an attack on United States interests.  The KCNA statement further noted that North Korean troops had been authorized to counteract American aggression with ""powerful practical military counteractions,"" including nuclear weapons, and involving ""cutting-edge smaller, lighter, and diversified nuclear strike means.""  The KCNA statement included the following warning: ""The moment of explosion is approaching fast. No one can say a war will break out in Korea or not and whether it will break out today or tomorrow.""  The expressed nuclear threat was the most blatant and belligerent exposition from the North Korean regime on global stability in recent memory.  Raising the  threat to another level, Pyongyang also told foreign embassies that it could not guarantee their safety in the event of conflict.In a speech to the National Defense University in Washington, United States Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel noted that the recent actions of the North Koreans ""present a real and clear danger.""  Meanwhile, Russian  foreign ministry spokesperson, Alexander Lukashevich, observed that North Korea's actions may very well foreclose the notion of multilateral negotiations .  He cast Pyongyang's attempts to violate decisions of the United Nations Security Council"" as  ""categorically unacceptable,"" and issued the following warning: ""This radically complicates, if it doesn't in practice shut off, the prospects for resuming six-party talks.""On April 5, 2013, Western officials were confirming reports that North Korea had moved a medium-range missile, known as a Musudan or Nodong B, to its east coast. It was unknown if the move was to be interpreted as a threatening gesture , with a warhead mounted on the missile, or part of the preparations for test firing.  There was growing suspicion  that North Korea might, in fact, be preparing to carry out yet another missile test. It should be noted that while this Musudan/Nodong B missile has a range of around 3,000 kilometers (1,875 miles), which would put all of South Korea, Japan, and possibly the United States' territory of Guam in its range; however, there was no test history to ensure precision. As noted by  Greg Thielmann, a senior fellow at the Arms Control Association,  ""A missile that has never even had a flight test is not an operational system and is not a credible threat."" Of course,  a missile launch might be in the offing for the purpose of acquiring that test history.By April 10, 2013, South Korean sources said that North Korea appeared to be preparing to launch the Musudan mid-range ballistic missile that had been moved to the east coast, and warned that North Korea might even be preparing the fire the Musudan simultaneously with shorter range Nodong and Scud missiles.  The missiles launch could conceivably coincide with the celebration of the birthday of Kim Il-sung, the country's founder.Meanwhile, the rhetoric from North Korea continued to be bellicose with North Korean state media asserting that the scenario on the  Korean Peninsula situation was ""inching close to a thermonuclear war,""  and authorities in Pyongyang warning foreign nationals in  South Korea to evacuate from that country.  The Obama administration in the United States, via White House spokesperson, Jay Carney, characterized North Korea's statements as ""unhelpful.""  Carney continued, ""This kind of rhetoric will only further isolate North Korea from the international community and we continue to urge the North Korean leadership to heed President Obama's call to choose the path of peace and to come into compliance with its international obligations.""It should be noted that the foreign ministers of the so-called G-8 countries -- the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy,  Canada, Japan, and Russia -- have condemned North Korea's recent actions, and warned of consequences in North Korea conducts either a missile launch or a nuclear test.  On April 12, 2013, United States Secretary of State John Kerry traveled to South Korea and accentuated this multilateral warning, saying ""If Kim Jong-Un decides to launch a missile, whether it is across the Sea of Japan or some other direction, he will be choosing willfully to ignore the entire international community.""A day later, Secretary of State Kerry  met with Chinese leaders to find ways to end the geopolitical crisis brewing on the Korean peninsular.  Following that meeting, Secretary Kerry said that the United States and China were both calling for North Korea to refrain from further provocative actions. It was clear that the international community was united in its stance against North Korea's recent acts of dangerous provocation.Secretary of State John Kerry ended his Asian trip with a call for negotiations to end the dissonance and emphasizing the imperative of finding  a diplomatic solution. He said, ""The United States remains open to authentic and credible negotiations on denuclearization, but the burden is on Pyongyang. North Korea must take meaningful steps to show that it will honor commitments it has already made, and it has to observe laws and the norms of international behavior.""Meanwhile, with an eye on decreasing the tensions between the two Koreas, South Korean President Park Geun-hye called for peaceful dialogue.  But North  Korea was quick to reject the overture, characterizing the offer of talks as a  ""cunning ploy.""  If that response was any indication, North Korea remained defiant in the face of international pressure.Latest DevelopmentsApril 15, 2013 -- the  anniversary of North Korea's founder's birth -- passed fairly quietly, without a continuation of the bellicose war threats and even free of a huge military parade showcasing North Korean military might.  The hopes that North Korea might be digesting the call for talks, and that the heated geopolitical climate had cooled for the moment, dissipated as Pyongyang issued new threats of war.  A statement via state-controlled media was issued as follows: ""Our retaliatory action will start without any notice from now.""It should be noted that South Korea  responded to the recent actions of North Korea by deploying two warships with  the Aegis missile defense systems on the east and west coasts.  As well, Japan deployed missile defense systems around Tokyo to defend against any missile threat by North Korea.In an interview with NBC News broadcast on April 16, 2013, United States President Barack Obama said that while the intelligence available does not suggest that North Korea has the ability to successfully arm a ballistic missile with nuclear warheads, he yet believed his country needed to be prepared for all possibilities.  He said,  ""Based on our current intelligence assessments we do not think that they have that capacity. But we have to make sure that we are dealing with every contingency out there.  That's why I repositioned missile defense systems: to guard against any miscalculation on their part.""Asked whether he believed the  North Korean leader, Kim Jung-Un, was mentally unstable, President Obama responded, ""I'm not a psychiatrist. And I don't know the leader of North Korea.""However, President Obama characterized  North Korea's exposition of bellicose and vituperative war rhetoric as being similar to a childish tantrum, and unlikely to yield productive results.  He said, ""You don't get to bang your spoon on the table and somehow you get your way.""President Obama seemed cognizant of the fact that the impasse was unlikely to end easily, although he did not foreclose the possibility of a diplomatic resolution.  He mused, ""All of us would anticipate that North Korea will probably make more provocative moves over the next several weeks... This is the same kind of pattern that we saw his father engage in, and his grandfather before that. If they want to rejoin the community of nations, that path is available to them.""On April 18, 2013, North Korea's National Defense Commission issued a statement via the official Korean Central News Agency, demanding that the United States and South Korea withdraw ""all nuclear war making capabilities from the region,"" with an eye on future dialogue.  North Korea also called for  Washington and Seoul to apologize for its  aggression.In response, a spokesperson for the  White House, Josh Earnest,  said that the Obama administration was committed to denuclearization of the Korean peninsular and was open to ""authentic and credible negotiations.""  Earnest noted that the  actions and rhetoric from North Korea ""actually indicate the opposite.""  He added, ""We also need to see some clear evidence that the North Koreans themselves are willing to live up to their international obligations, are willing to demonstrate their commitment to ending the nuclear program, something they've promised in the past.""By April 21, 2013, North Korea was reported to have moved  two short-range missile launchers to the east coast.  According to a South Korean military source in a report by the South Korean Yonhap news agency, satellite imagery showed the transfer of  two mobile missile launchers suitable for short-range Scud missiles to the South Hamgyeong province.  Earlier in the month, as noted above, two mid-range Musudan missiles were  place on launchers on the east coast.  Collectively, these actions indicated that a missile launch might be in the offing -- possibly to mark the  anniversary of the founding of the North Korean military on April 25.  However, that date passed without any show of force.In the last week of April 2013, South Korea called on North Korea to engage in  dialogue over the Kaesong industrial complex, which became a flashpoint in the ongoing crisis between the two Koreas.  Regarded as a symbol of cooperation between North Korea and South Korea, the decision by the North to block access to the jointly-run industrial complex was interpreted as a clear sign of deteriorating relations, devolving diplomacy,  and the slide towards confrontation.  That slide became more precipitous when  North Korea outright rejected the invitation to engage in  talks.  South Korea, therefore, responded by withdrawing its nationals from the  Kaesong industrial zone in the interests of safety.On May 6, 2013,  CBS News reported that the two Musudan medium-range missiles, which had been moved to the east coast of North Korea weeks prior, were now removed from the launch site. Those missiles, as discussed above,  had sufficient range to reach Japan as well as the United States territory of Guam in the Pacific.The movement of the missiles was being interpreted in some circles as a cooling of the heated tensions on the Korean Peninsular. Of course, with the start of the spring farming season, it was also possible that many members of the army were -- as they do each year --  necessarily turning their attention to the planting effort.Regardless of the rationale, the removal of the Musudan missiles from the launch site conceivably indicated that the threat posed by North Korea was reduced at this time, if only on a temporary basis.  Indeed, since the Musudan is a mobile missile, it could well be transported back to the launch site in short order.  As noted by a senior United States official from the National Security Council in an interview with BBC News, it was ""premature to celebrate it as good news,"" given North Korea's record of unpredictable behavior to date. Striking a similar tone, George Little, a Pentagon spokesperson,  characterized North Korea's most recent stance as ""a provocation pause.""May 2013 saw North Korea carry out a series of short-range missile tests from its east coast.  As global leaders attempted to bring down the level of tensions on the Korean Peninsular,  and even after North Korea pulled back its two medium range missiles from its launch pad, the firing of four -- albeit short range -- missiles was being regarded as a provocation.  It was not known if North Korea was trying to re-ignite geo-political tensions or if the tests were routine exercises intended to simply show military might. Regardless, United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon  urged North Korea to refrain from carrying out any further missile tests and ""resume dialogue.""Presumably in an effort to show that the United States was fully prepared to defend itself from the potential nuclear missile threat posed by North Korea or any other belligerent nation state, the Missile Defense Agency along with the United States Navy on May 16, 2013  completed a successful test of a missile defense system as it destroyed a target launched in the Pacific Ocean.  According to reports from the  Department of Defense, a short-range ballistic missile target was launched  from the Pacific Missile Range Facility on the Hawaiian island of Kauai;  the USS Lake Erie was able to  detect and track the missile, then launch a blocking missile with a kinetic warhead, which successfully destroyed the target.  United States officials said the test operation in Hawaii demonstrated that the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense system was fully functional.Negotiations Planned and CanceledOn June 6, 2013, North Korea proposed convening talks with South Korea over the jointly-administered Kaesong industrial zone, which had been shut down months earlier amidst heightened tensions.  The proposal  also included a provision to restart tours at the Mount Kumgang resort, which was suspended when a South Korea tourist was shot by a North Korean guard in 2008.In regards to the more recent closure of the industrial complex,  more than 50,000 North Korean workers at Kaesong were withdrawn and South Koreans and supplies were banned entry as part of North Korea's illustration that it was in a ""state of war"" with South Korea.  As intimated above in the ""Background"" note, the Kaesong complex has often been viewed as a symbol of cross-border cooperation between the two Koreas and its closure augured negatively as regards the overall geo-political security on the Korean Peninsular. But with North Korea's Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea offering the overture of dialogue on Kaeosong and Mount Kumgang,  it was believed that an effort was being made to de-escalate tensions and move to a more constructive footing.North Korea's Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea issued the following statement outlining its proposal of dialogue: ""We propose holding talks between authorities of the North and South for the normalization of operations at Kaesong and the resumption of tours to Mount Kumgang on the occasion of the anniversary of the June 15 joint declaration.""  South Korea's Ministry of Unification, which administers inter-Korean affairs, said the government in Seoul was ""considering the proposal in a positive light."" Earlier, South Korea made it clear that given the precipitous and dangerous decline in bilateral relations during the first part of 2013, it would not only consider government level engagement with North Korea.One day later on June 7, 2013, South Korea accepted North Korea's offer of bilateral talks but insisted that rather than have them take place in the  North Korean border town of Kaesong, that the dialogue site be in the  truce village of Panmunjom in the demilitarized zone between the countries.  South Korea also  noted that it was interested in taking up a range of issues, including the Kaesong Industrial Complex, the tourist center at Mount Kumgang, and the notion of family reunions.  The North reacted to South Korea's stance in a rare show of cordiality  asserting the following via a statement: ""We appreciate the fact that the South side promptly and positively responded to the proposal made by us for holding talks between the authorities of both sides.""It should be noted that the North Korean government in Pyongyang also said that if Seoul accepted its proposal, it would also re-establish the emergency hotline channels, which were severed earlier in the year, as noted above.But optimism about diplomatic progress between the two Koreas plummeted on June 11, 2013, when despite the fact that preliminary talks on technical and administrative details were reported to have gone smoothly.  By June 13, 2013, more details emerged related to the cancellation of the negotiations.  The cause was attributed to the composition of the respective delegations at the negotiating table in the first ministerial level talks since 2007.Originally, South Korean Unification Minister Ryoo Kihl-jae was slated to lead South Korea's delegation.  When South Korea requested that North Korea send Kim Yang-gon, an adviser to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un,  to the talks, North Korea declined.  Seoul then decided to dispatch  Vice-Unification Minister Kim Nam-shik to lead its delegation instead.  North Korea took offense to the apparent ""downgraded"" level of South Korean officials present  at the talks  and decided to withdraw completely.  North Korea placed the blame on South Korea for ""arrogant obstruction"" and ""deliberate disturbance"" resulting in the aborted negotiations.  North Korea further characterized South Korea's decision to change the composition of its delegation in this manner as ""the height of discourtesy and disrespect unprecedented in the history of the North-South dialogue"".For its part, South Korea  said it was disappointed with North Korea's response.  South Korea also made it clear that  it would not be offering to participate in negotiations with North Korea at any point in the near future.  As noted by South Korean Prime Minister Chung Hong-won: ""In the past, we have made infinite concessions to the North, but the time has come to hold talks where both sides are represented by officials of the same level.""At the start of July 2013, relations between the two Koreas seemed to be moving in a more productive direction when North Korea agreed to hold talks on the Kaesong industrial complex, only hours after South Korea suggested  the meeting.  It was hoped that this overture would end more positively than the situation in June 2013 when the proposed Kaesong discussions were halted over procedural disagreements, as discussed just above.  However, as of mid-July 2013, there was no immediate agreement reached on resuming operations at their joint Kaesong industrial complex.With relations between the two Koreas at a stalemate of sorts in mid-June 2013 (subsequently improved in early July 2013, as discussed above), it came as something of a surprise when North Korea proposed direct talks with the United States.  North Korea's  National Defense Commission, headed by North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un, said it hoped for ""serious discussions... to secure peace and stability.""  The United States responded to this overture by saying it looked towards  ""credible negotiations,"" made clear that North Korea had to be compliant with United Nations resolutions and travel down the path of denuclearization.At the start of July 2013, North Korea renewed its push for engagement with the United States when Choi Myung-nam, an international affairs director at the North Korean Foreign Ministry, said Washington should take Pyongyang's diplomatic offers seriously. It should be noted that while representatives of the United States and North Korea have held meetings sporadically, the two sides have not  engaged in high-level talks since 2009.Meanwhile, in the third week of June 2013, North Korea was apparently building on its sudden appetite for diplomatic engagement as it expressed an interest in restarting international nuclear negotiations.  According to  China's foreign ministry, North Korean officials were now indicating that they wanted to ""peacefully resolve the nuclear issue.""  It should be noted that multilateral talks between North Korea, South Korea, China, Japan, Russia, and the United States over North Korea's controversial nuclear program collapsed in 2008.  North Korea's renewed interest in diplomatic engagement at the multilateral level came as a result of high-level strategic talks with Chinese officials in Beijing. It was to be seen if an actual return to the multilateral negotiating table was in the offing.In mid-August 2013,  the two Koreas were  able to successfully reach an agreement to re-open the jointly-administered Kaesong industrial complex.  The accord between the two countries included a provision ensuring that Pyongyang would never again shut the industrial complex -- often viewed as a symbol of cross-border cooperation --  ""under any circumstances.""  Another key provision of the accord was the move to  ""internationalize"" the Kaesong industrial complex by hosting foreign visitors at the factory park. This element would effectively make it harder for  North Korea to take any unilateral action involving the facility.  Left unspecified at the time was a precise date for the reopening of the facility and the resumption of regular operations.By September 2013  the two Koreas agreed on a ""trial"" start date of Sept. 16, 2013.  It should be noted that agreement was also forged in regard to exempting South Korean firms from taxes for the rest of 2013  to offset losses incurred during the period of months when the complex was closed.  Agreement was also made to facilitate easier access to the complex for South Koreans carrying out commercial responsibilities, and for the purpose of attracting foreign investors to the Kaesong Industrial Complex.Nuclear site activity --In mid-2013, despite the overtures of diplomatic engagement to the United States, and a stated interest in returning to multilateral talks, satellite imagery depicting a North Korean test site indicated possible preparations for a possible test of a nuclear device in the future.  Researchers at John Hopkins University's North Korean Blog 38 Forum reported that satellite imagery of the Punggye-ri nuclear test site showed that some construction was being carried out the site where  North Korea conducted nuclear tests in 2009 and 2013. Researchers at John Hopkins University said: ""This activity appears to have begun by late April 2013 and gathered momentum over the next few months.""  While there was no conclusive sense of what the increased activity at the Punggye-ri nuclear test site really meant, the researchers suggested that the construction could simply be a matter of repairs, or preparations for a future test.  As stated in the Blog 37: ""These activities do not appear to be part of preparations for a nuclear test in the near-term. Rather, they seem to be long-term projects ... that may be necessary for the conduct of future tests.""In September 2013,  signs pointed to the fact that operations were being restarted at North Korea's Yongbyon reactor.  Of note was the fact that white steam was seen rising from the Yongbyon nuclear facility.  According to the Blog 38 North website of the United States-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University, the color and volume of the steam signaled that the reactor was getting close to being operational.  The blog entry read as follows: ""The white coloration and volume are consistent with steam being vented because the electrical generating system is about to come online, indicating that the reactor is in or nearing operation,"" said the Washington-based institute.""  It seemed that regardless of calming of tensions, North Korea was going forward with the threat made in April 2013 about re-opening its Yongbyon facility.As stated by Jeffrey Lewis of Blog 38 in an interview with BBC News, ""The reactor looks like it either is or will within a matter of days be fully operational, and as soon as that happens, it will start producing plutonium."" He continued, ""They really are putting themselves in a position to increase the amount of material they have for nuclear weapons, which I think gives them a little bit of leverage in negotiations, and adds a sense of urgency on our part.""Still, that sense of urgency was a relative one with the Institution for Science and International Security issuing a report in which it would yet take time before North Korea could use new plutonium in nuclear weapons.  The institute's report issued the following finding: ""Given that North Korea will likely need two-three years before it discharges irradiated fuel containing plutonium and another six to 12 months to separate the plutonium, there remains time to negotiate a shutdown of the reactor before North Korea can use any of this new plutonium in nuclear weapons.""*** Note:  See below for  information on North Korea's nuclear test history, nuclear capability, and the United States' reaction to the threat posed by North Korea to its national security. ***Special Report:North Korean ship carrying Cuban weapons intercepted by Panamanian authoritiesAn international imbroglio was in the making in mid-July 2013 when a North Korean ship carrying Cuban weapons was intercepted by Panamanian authorities. According to  Panamanian President Ricardo Martinelli, the ship was targeted by drug enforcement officials as it  traveled from Cuba and approached the Panama Canal. Of concern to the Panamanian authorities was the fact that the ship disappeared from satellite tracking systems after it left the Caribbean side of the Panama Canal. This situation raised the suspicions of Panamanian authorities who wondered why the ship's crew would de-activate the tracking system that conveys details of the vessel's location.As stated by Panamanian President Ricardo Martinelli, ""We had suspected this ship, which was coming from Cuba and headed to North Korea, might have drugs aboard so it was brought into port for search and inspection."" When the vessel, Chong Chon Gang, was taken into port and subject to search and inspection, its  cargo of suspected missiles was uncovered. Of note was the fact that the weapons were discovered amidst a shipment of sugar.The drama in the Panama Canal reached new heights, according to Panamanian President Martinelli, when the North Korean ship captain had a heart attack and tried to commit suicide, while a riot involving the ship's crew of 35 ensued.  The entire crew was subsequently taken into custody while the vessel and its shipments were seized. As well, President  Martinelli posted an image via his Twitter account depicting a large green object inside a cargo container, which he characterized as the suspected ""sophisticated missile equipment.""Soon after the fracas unfolded, Cuba admitted that this stash of weapons was included in its shipment of 10,000 tonnes of sugar to North Korea.  Cuba explained that the weapons were obsolete Soviet-era arms from Cuba  being sent for repair in North Korea.  That explanation was plausible since North Korea possesses some expertise in the weapons arena. However, Panama called on the United Nations to lead an inquiry into the weapons materials to determine precisely what was stashed in the shipment.Under the aegis of prevailing  United Nations sanctions, the transportation of all weapons to or from North Korea is prohibited.  Moreover, even a benign matter such as the transportation of weapons for repair to North Korea  would, nonetheless,  require a waiver from the United Nations Security Council.  It would seem that no such waiver was procured by Cuba or North Korea.As well, regulations pertaining to the transfer of shipments through the Panama Canal required the declaration of military cargo, including  so-called ""obsolete"" weapons. Thus, an investigation into the matter was  underway, while the North Korean crew was faced with the prospect of charges of illegal weapons smuggling in Panama. As noted by President Martinelli, ""The world needs to sit up and take note: you cannot go around shipping undeclared weapons of war through the Panama Canal.""It should be noted that North Korea issued a demand that its ship be returned and the crew of the Chong Chon Gang be released.  Panama was not acquiescing to this demand and, instead, was moving forward with the aforementioned investigation.By the close of July 2013, woes for Cuba and North Korea over the infamous ship carrying weapons cargo only increased.  At issue was the report by Panamanian authorities that four new undeclared containers were found aboard the  Chong Chon Gang, quite likely in  violation of United Nations sanctions.  That determination, however, was yet to be made.In February 2014 ,  Panama had released the  Chong Chon Gang and the  ship's owner was forced to pay a fine totalling almost $700,000 for violating navigation regulations (specifically those attending to the transporation of weapons).  As well,  three crew members were facing weapons trafficking charges, although the charges against the other 32 crew members were dropped.At issue for the Panamanian government was the fact that the weapons  being smuggled were not ""obsolete defensive weapons"" as claimed by Cuba, but in fact several sophisticated weapons in perfect condition.  Indeed, it was soon revealed that the stash of weapons included two MiG-21 aircraft, 15 MiG engines and nine anti-aircraft missiles.A preliminary report  by a panel of experts to the Sanctions Committee at the United Nations Security Council concluded that the Chong Chon Gang  violated prevailing United Nations sanctions against North Korea, which ban the transfer of weapons to that country.Yet to be determined would be the type of penalties the United Nations Security Council would levy against Cuba.Special Entry:North Korean leader Kim Jong-un executes uncle referring to Chang Song-thaek as a ""traitor"" --In December 2013, Chang Song-thaek -- the uncle of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un -- was removed from his top military post as  the vice-chairman of the  National Defense Commission.  South Korean media reported that in addition to Chang's dismissal, two of his close aides were also executed for corruption.Less than a week after the news broke about Chang's dismissal,  the official Korean Central News Agency took the unprecedented step in this secretive and hermetic country of announcing that a military trial had been held and Chang had been put to death.  Chang  was branded both a ""traitor"" and ""human scum,"" and executed for ""acts of treachery.""  The state media went the extra mile by detailing those acts of treachery.During his military trial, Chang supposedly admitted that he attempting to overthrow the state via the formation of his own  reformist faction or ""little kingdom.""  A central element of Chang's agenda, according to the state, was a scheme to drive the economy into  ""an uncontrollable catastrophe.""  According to the official report, which was cited in the North Korean state media: ""Chang dreamed such a foolish dream that once he seizes power by a base method, his despicable true colors as a reformist would be  known to the outside world  and would help his new government get recognized by foreign countries in a short span of time."" Clearly, if such a plan was really part of Chang's agenda, it had not ended successfully and the man at the center was now eliminated.At the level of political strategy,  the removal of Chang from a position of power, followed by  his quick military trial and execution  marked the most significant signs of political upheaval in North Korea  since Kim Jong-un succeeded his father -- the late Kim Jong-il -- as the leader of the paranoid and secretive North Korean nation state.Chang has, in the past, been subject to political ""purges"" in  North Korea.  Despite being elected to the Central Committee of North Korea's Korean Workers' Party (KWP) in 1992, he disappeared from the public purview in 2004 with speculation abounding that he was under house arrest.  There were additional rumors that he was sent to a ""re-education"" camp.  Chang re-emerged in 2006 and has since he regarded as an economic reformer and an ally to Kim Jong-un. His dismissal was  viewed, at the time, as a major shake-up on the North Korean political scene.  Clearly, his execution signified an even more shocking shift on the North Korean landscape.  Since the position of the vice-chairman of the  National Defense Commission has long been regarded as the ""second in command"" position to the supreme leader, Chang's removal and execution was likely to create a seismic shift in the power hierarchy of North Korea.  Indeed, Kim Jong-un was  making his mark on the political structure and making it clear that he had full  control  and absolute authority over  the North Korean state.  Kim Jong-un  was further warning would-be antagonists, reformists, and dissenters that the price for disloyalty would be death.The White House in the United States reacted to the news of Chang's execution by with the following statement: ""If confirmed, this is another example of the extreme brutality of the North Korean regime. We are following developments in North Korea closely and consulting with our allies and partners in the region.""

Special Entry:

Satellite photos indicate North Korea producing fuel rods for nuclear reactor at Yongbyon --    On Dec. 24, 2013, the United States-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University in Washington D.C. reported that satellite imagery indicated that North Korea was producing fuel rods for its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon.     Months earlier in September 2013,  amidst progress on the diplomatic front as the two Koreas agreed to re-open operations at the jointly-administered Kaesong industrial complex, there was retrenchment on the matter of North Korea's nuclear program.  There were indications that operations were being restarted at North Korea's Yongbyon reactor. Of note was the fact that white steam was seen rising from the Yongbyon nuclear facility.      According to the Blog 38 North website of the United States-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University, the color and volume of the steam signaled that the reactor was getting close to being operational.  The blog entry read as follows: ""The white coloration and volume are consistent with steam being vented because the electrical generating system is about to come online, indicating that the reactor is in or nearing operation,"" said the Washington-based institute.""  It seemed that regardless of calming of tensions, North Korea was going forward with the threat made in April 2013 about re-opening its Yongbyon facility.    As stated by Jeffrey Lewis of Blog 38 in an interview with BBC News in September 2013, ""The reactor looks like it either is or will within a matter of days be fully operational, and as soon as that happens, it will start producing plutonium."" He continued, ""They really are putting themselves in a position to increase the amount of material they have for nuclear weapons, which I think gives them a little bit of leverage in negotiations, and adds a sense of urgency on our part.""       Still, that sense of urgency was a relative one with the Institution for Science and International Security issuing a report in which it would yet take time before North Korea could use new plutonium in nuclear weapons.  The institute's report issued the following finding: ""Given that North Korea will likely need two-three years before it discharges irradiated fuel containing plutonium and another six to 12 months to separate the plutonium, there remains time to negotiate a shutdown of the reactor before North Korea can use any of this new plutonium in nuclear weapons.""    But as of late December 2013, clearly no ""shutdown"" of the reactor was in the immediate offing.  Instead, the United States-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University was  reporting that satellite imagery showed that North Korea was producing fuel rods for its Yongbyon nuclear reactor.  The United States-Korea Institute  further concluded that one building at Yonbyon had been renovated to produce fresh fuel rods for the reactor, which appeared to be operational.  As well, another building was identified which could be used to produce fuel for a light-water reactor.      Via the Blog 38 North website, the United States-Korea Institute offered the following  assessment: ""The identification of these facilities indicates a more wide-ranging, extensive effort by North Korea to modernize and restart the Yongbyon complex."" The institute continued, ""Based on this analysis, it appears the North Koreans anticipated that future requirement before 2009 and knew the lead times required to produce the necessary fresh fuel. Once international inspectors were expelled in 2009, they moved forward with the renovation of the main pilot plant building as part of what was likely their contingency plan for reactivation.""    The ""good news"" for neighboring countries anxious about a nuclear-armed North Korea was the belief that Pyongyang holds possession of only 25 percent of the fuel rods necessary for the reactor to reach full power.    Special Entry    North Korea and South Korea exchange fire following North Korean threat of another nuclear test    On Feb. 27, 2014, North Korea fired four short-range missiles over the sea off its eastern coast -- essentially to the north of the border with South Korea. The South Korea Yonhap News Agency speculated that the missiles were Scud short-range missiles with a  capacity of traversing 125 miles and thus capable of reaching targets in South Korea but not as far as Japan.    On March 2, 2014, North Korea fired another two short-range missiles into the sea off the eastern coast of the Korean peninsula.  The South Korea Yonhap news Agency reported that the missiles likely flew about 300 miles and were believed to be  Scud-C models -- this time capable of reaching targets in both South Korea and Japan.    In the third week of March 2014, North Korea fired  a series of 30 short-range rockets into the sea off the eastern end of the Korean peninsula. The rockets were thought to be Soviet-era FROG rockets that have been in North Korea's possession since the 1960s, and seemingly flew for more than 35 miles before landing in the sea.  This launch of the 30 FROG missiles came after other such missile tests in the weeks prior, as discussed above.    In the last week of March 2014, North Korea test fired two medium range Nodong missiles, which landed in the ocean between North Korea and Japan.  The action essentially triggered a condemnation from the United Nations Security Council, which noted that the missile launches were a violation of prevailing United Nations resolutions, such as  Security Council Resolutions 1718  and  1874 that prohibit North Korea from carrying out ballistic or nuclear activity.  The United Nations Security Council also warned  of an ""appropriate response"" to come.  Undeterred, North Korea lashed back at the United Nations Security Council, characterizing its condemnation as  ""absolutely intolerable"" and justifying its own action as being a ""self-defensive"" move.    There were suggestions that North Korea was reacting to the  annual joint military exercises by United States and South Korean forces, which Pyongyang typically characterizes as acts of war and aggression.  Fueling the fire for North Korea was the flight of a United States nuclear-capable B-52 bomber  over South Korea.  South Korean authorities have put forth the theory that North Korea's missile launched constituted an ""armed protest"" against the joint South Korean-United States military drills that were taking place.    Perhaps exasperated by North Korea's provocative acts and  saber rattling, which were manifest most recently by the missile launches, China had already entered the equation.  Even before the launch of the medium range missiles in the last week of March 2014,  China hard earlier  declared a ""red line,"" saying that it would not allow  war or chaos on  the Korean peninsula, and  asserting that peace was possible only  via  denuclearization. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi was on the record saying, ""The Korean peninsula is right on China's doorstep. We have a red line, that is, we will not allow war or instability on the Korean peninsula."" Wang demanded that  all parties  ""exercise restraint"" and noted that ""genuine and lasting peace"" on the Korean peninsula was only possible with denuclearization.  He said, ""Confrontation can only bring tension, and war can only cause disaster.""  The Chinese foreign minister also endorsed the resumption of multilateral nuclear talks, saying, ""Some dialogue is better than none, and better early than later.""    This stance by China -- North Korea's most  important diplomatic and economic supporter -- suggested that Beijing was no longer willing to accept Pyongyang's theatrics on its doorstep.   Pressure on North Korea had already begun to intensify a month earlier in February 2014 when the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, urged global powers  to refer North Korea to the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court following a report that documented horrific crimes against humanity in that country.   While China was unlikely to join the human rights chorus against North Korea, it certainly seemed prepared to use its influence to compel  North Korea to return to the nuclear negotiating table.  Adding to the suggestion that dialogue might be at hand, Japan and North Korea were scheduled to engage in their first high level talks in years.    However, the nuclear negotiating table appeared to be a distant notion as March 2014 came to a close, and as North Korea threatened to go forward with a nuclear test.  As reported by the North Korean Central News Agency, North Korea said it would not foreclose the possibility of testing a ""new form"" nuclear weapon in defiance of international condemnation and in contravention of prevailing international law. While Pyongyang did not specify the type of nuclear weaponry it intended to test, the conventional wisdom has long been  held that North Korea was attempting to develop small and sophisticated nuclear devices that could be delivered by intercontinental ballistic missiles.    South Korea warned that if its neighbor to the north went forward with a nuclear test, there would be consequences in the offing.  As noted by South Korea Foreign Ministry spokesman Cho Tae-young, ""North Korea should bear in mind that if it ignores the stern demand from the neighboring countries and the international community and carries out a nuclear test, it will have to pay a price for it.""    On March 31, 2014, tensions on the Korean peninsula exponentially increased as North Korea and South Korea exchanged fire across its western maritime border.    According to South Korean authorities, this exchange of fire was presaged by North Korea's announcement that it would hold ""live fire"" military drills along its border zone with South Korea.  South Korea warned that there would be immediate retaliation if any ordinance touched its jurisdiction.  North Korea then fired more than 500 artillery rounds, some 100 of which landed in South Korean territorial waters.  As promised,  the South Koreans responded by firing  more than 300 rounds into  North Korean waters and scrambling F-15s on its side of the maritime border.    Known as the Northern Limit Line, the maritime border has been a well known flashpoint region between the two Koreas, and its very existence is a matter of dispute from the point of view of the North Koreans. The boundary was established after the end of the Korean War in the 1950s by the United Nations, but the line of demarcation has been accepted by North Korea.   It should be noted that North Korean artillery fire killed four South Koreans on the Yeonpyeong border island in the same disputed area in 2010.  In another egregious incident in 2010, North Korea torpedoed a South Korean warship in the disputed border region, sinking the vessel and killing 46 people.  Now, in 2014, it was again the locus of dissonance between the two Koreas as a result of the North's decision to hold military drills in this hotspot region.    It was to be seen if these were actions by North Korea were aimed at improving Pyongyang's negotiating position for the future as it attempted to stave off further sanctions that were likely to come, or, if they were intended to be blatant and irrational acts of provocation.  South Korean Defence Ministry spokesperson,  Kim Min-seok, intimated that Pyongyang's actions were being motivated by both factors as he said, ""We believe the North's maritime firing is a planned provocation and an attempt to test our military's determination to defend the Northern Limit Line and to get an upper hand in South-North relations.""    *** Note:  See below for  information on North Korea's nuclear test history, nuclear capability, and the United States' reaction to the threat posed by North Korea to its national security. ***    Special Entry    North Korea test fires missiles ahead of South Korean visit by Chinese president    On July 2, 2014, North Korea fired a series of short-range rockets into the sea off its east coast. While the type of rockets could not be confirmed by South Korean sources that reported the event, they surmised that they were likely 300 mm rockets. Days earlier, North Korea fired two short range ballistic missiles.  It should be noted that while the short range rocket launch were not in violation of prevailing United Nations Security Council resolutions against North Korea, the firing of short range  ballistic missiles were, indeed, in violation of international law.    The apparent display of military might by North Korea came ahead of a visit by  Chinese President Xi Jinping to South Korea.  It was not known if the test firing of missiles was intended to intimidate China, which is North Korea's only major ally and home to a own far more sophisticated military. But with China being pressured by South Korea and the West to use its influence to curb North Korea's provocative actions, and return to the negotiating table as regards its nuclear and missile program, it was possible that North Korea was delivering the message that it would not be swayed by its closest ally, especially when that ally's leader was on a formal visit to South Korea.  In truth, Chinese   President Xi Jinping  was returning the courtesy of a visit to China by South Korean President Park Geun-hye; however, it was not likely that paranoid Pyongyang would interpret the visit in the most benign manner.    Note that in the second week of July 2014, Jon Pyong Ho -- a  former North Korean missile expert  who played a central role in his country's nuclear weapons and missile  programs -- died.  The news of his death occurred even as  North Korea launched a fresh volley of short-range missiles into waters off its eastern  coast.  Although Ho was sanctioned by the United Nations because of his nuclear development work, including his direction of the infamous 2006 nuclear test, he had more recently entered retirement.  As such, his death was not likely to impact North Korea's nuclear and missile development program. A state funeral was in the offing.    North Korea fires three short-range rockets ahead of Pope Francis' visit to South Korea    In mid-August 2014, North Korea fired three short range rockets from the port city of Wonsan; the rockets landed in the sea off the east coast of the Korean peninsula.  The incident coincided with Pope Francis' arrival in South Korea for a five day visit and ahead of scheduled joint military exercises between South Korea and the United States.  North Korea objects to those drills, charging that they are intended to prepare for war.  As such, North Korea has typically taken some sort of provocative action to protest the joint military activity.  In this case, North Korea reacted with the firing of the rockets as well as the issuance of a statement that read as follows: ""Given that the U.S. and the puppet forces of South Korea continue staging nuclear war exercises against us in particular, we will take countermeasures for self-defense which will include missile launches, nuclear tests, and all other programs.""  It was to be seen if North Korea would indeed follow up the rocket launches with nuclear tests, as indicated.     *** Note:  See below for  information on North Korea's nuclear test history, nuclear capability, and the United States' reaction to the threat posed by North Korea to its national security. ***    Special Note    No ""Game of Thrones"" in North Korea as Kim Jong-un returns to spotlight    With North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un out of the public spotlight for several weeks, speculation began to rise in the early autumn of 2014 about his health and / or whether he remained in control of the country.     Most of the speculation  has focused on the matter of Kim Jon-un's health.  Some of the last footage of the North Korean leader indicated his leg may have been injured and thus prevented him from taking part in state activities.  Still, there were questions as to why a leg or foot injury, quite possibly caused either by gout or a broken ankle, may have kept Kim Jong-un cloistered for such an extended period of time.    Accordingly, speculation was slowly moving in the direction of whether Kim Jong-un was embroiled in -- and perhaps even sidelined by --  a power struggle.   Indeed, a spate of reports emerged at the start of October 2014, ruminating as to whether the North Korean leader had been deposed in a secret coup. The absence of Kim Jong-un on Oct. 10, 2014, at the annual commemoration of the foundation of the Korean Workers Party only added to the mounting suggestions that a power shift might be underway.    Of significance, according to Remco Breuker, Professor of Korean studies at Leiden University in the Netherlands, was the deployment of three leading political officers in the North Korean military to the closing ceremony of the Asian Games in South Korea. Referring to these individuals at that event, Breuker said: ""They have sent out high ranking officials before but never in the capacity of representing the supreme leader.  This may well be the first time.""  Defectors from North Korea also commented on the presence of the three leading political officers at the ceremony in South Korea, drawing attention to the fact that they were accompanied by bodyguards (a measure typically reserved for the North Korean president), and that they exhibited odd behavior (specifically, they were shown smiling, made no mention of Kim Jung-un, and delivered no letter from the North Korean leader, as is the typical practice).    Meanwhile, in an interview with the publication, The Telegraph, Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor at  Waseda University in Japan, observed that a recent ban on travel passes might be a sign that either a coup had taken place or that a coup polot may have been uncovered.  Other North Korea experts have suggested that a low key power shift or transfer of power might be underway.  Still others have indicated that a battle for control -- something akin to a ""game of thrones"" -- was evolving in the isolated and secretive east Asian country.  To this end, one prevailing theory was the Kim Jung-un was removed from the leadership position.  With no obvious ""heir"" to the metaphoric ""throne,"" North Korea could possibly be governed by the Organization and Guidance Department (OGD) of the Korean Workers Party.    It should be noted that some sources in North Korea have insisted that Kim Jong-un remained in ""total control"" of the country and attributed his absence from the public scene to an injury.  Likewise, the United States has said that it has not seen any signs of a transfer of power in North Korea.  United States National Security Adviser Susan Rice said in an interview with NBC News, ""Obviously we are watching very carefully what's happening in North Korea. We have not seen any indications of a transfer of power at this point in North Korea that we view as definitive but we'll continue to watch it carefully.""    That guidance turned out to be true as Kim Jong-un re-emerged in the public purview on Oct. 14, 2014.  According to North Korea's state media, Kim Jong-un  visited a residential district and a science academy.  The news of these public visits ended speculation over his health as well as the rumors of a transition of power.    Special Note

United States slaps sanctions on North Korea in response to alleged cyber-attack on Sony   At the start of 2015, the United States imposed new sanctions on North Korea in response to an alleged cyber-attack on  Sony Pictures Entertainment.  Of note was the fact that United States sanctions against North Korea were already in place as a result of Pyongyang's provocative and dangerous nuclear program.  This new tranche of sanctions was being imposed as a retributive  measure promised by the Obama White House in response to a cyber-attack on Sony Pictures, which the United States government charged was carried out by agents of North Korea. While some cyber-experts have cast doubts on the claim that North Korea was behind the cyber-attack, the United States government has held steadfastly to that claim.    The cyber-attack on Sony Pictures began when the so-called Guardians of Peace hacked and released data from Sony's computers, exposing embarrassing electronic mail correspondence. The group soon took its attack to new heights, threatening theaters intending to screen Sony's satirical comedy, The Interview, which featured a humorous assassination plot against the leader of North Korea. Those threats caused Sony to cancel its cinema release of the movie, ultimately earning the rebuke of United States President Obama who suggested that decision by Sony was ""a mistake.""  To that end, Sony later reversed its decision and   released the film in some theaters and in online formats.   Meanwhile, North Korea's response to the hacking drama plaguing Sony was confusing.  Powers in that country at first praised the cyber-attack, casting it as a ""righteous deed,""  and even implying it might be the work of its own agents; later,  they denied culpability altogether.  However, as noted above, the United States made clear that it placed the blame for the Sony cyber-attack on North Korea, with Obama administration officials warning of  a ""proportional response"" in the offing.   By late 2014, there was speculation that a disruption or ""blackout"" of Internet service in North Korea may have been part of the package of consequences promised by the Obama administration against North Korea.  However, the United States government refused to acknowledge whether or not it was responsible for cutting off Internet connectivity in North Korea.    By contrast, at the start of 2015, the Treasury Department in the United States was utterly forthright  when it publicly named  three entities as well as 10 North Korean government officials in its  sanctions announcement.  The United States Treasury's list of targets included  individuals working in Iran, Syria, China, Russia and Namibia. The three entities covered by the sanctions were as follows: The Reconnaissance General Bureau -- North Korea's primary intelligence organization; the Korea Mining Development Trading Corporation (Komid) -- North Korea's primary arms dealer; and Korea Tangun Trading Corporation -- a defense research  agency.  It should be noted that the targets of the new sanctions were not necessarily linked to the cyber-hacking attack on Sony Pictures.  Instead, it appeared that the United States was simply augmenting its sanctions regime already in place against North Korea.  The intent was to isolate North Korea's defense industry as a deterrent against future cyber-attacks.   For his part, President Barack Obama signed an executive order on Jan. 2, 2015, officializing the sanctions, while the White House released a statement that read as follows:  ""We take seriously North Korea's attack that aimed to create destructive financial effects on a U.S. company and to threaten artists and other individuals with the goal of restricting their right to free expression. Today's actions are the first aspect of our response.""  The White House added,  ""This step reflects the ongoing commitment of the United States to hold North Korea accountable for its destabilizing, destructive and repressive actions, particularly its efforts to undermine U.S. cyber-security and intimidate U.S. businesses and artists exercising their right of freedom of speech.""   Special Note   North Korea launches anti-ship missiles in latest display of belligerance   In the second week of February 2015, with joint military exercises looming between the United States and South Korea, North Korea launched anti-ship missiles from hoverships. North Korea's news agency  published images showing  the hoverships launching a so-called ""cutting-edge anti-ship rocket"" that would be used to secure the contested marine border with South Korea.   Some observers expressed alarm over what they thought to be signs of intensifying technical abilities by North Korea and thus raising the threat level to neighboring countries.  They also suggested that the anti-missile technology may have come from either Russia or China, thus raising questions about those countries' culpability in facilitating North Korea's menacing behavior.  Still others dismissed the event as simply an act of aggression ahead of the aforementioned joint military exercises looming between the United States and South Korea.  But a third contingent of observers have suggested that the so-called advances in North Korean military capabilities were actually overblown.  Peter Singer, a strategist at the New America Foundation, said ""North Korea has a long track record of exaggerating and outright faking its military accomplishments... This is not going to disrupt the balance of power in the region."" Indeed, the use of hovercraft vessels can hardly be regarded as a cutting edge or breakthrough technology. It has been in use for some time across the world.   That being said,  North Korea's use of new missiles from hoverships would still pose a threat to the region. Should they be deployed in the area of contested marine waters, the South Korean military would be compelled to respond.  As such, the chances of a situation escalating militarily remained high, making it clear that North Korea remained a regional menace.   Special Note   U.S. Ambassador to South Korea brutally attacked; North Korea calls the violence justified   In the first week of March 2015, United States Ambassador Mark Lippert was brutally attacked by a pro-North Korean activist in the South Korean capital of Seoul.    Ambassador Lippert, who was serving as the United States envoy to South Korea, was attending a breakfast aimed at a discussion of the reunification of the two Koreas. During the breakfast, the assailant pushed Lippert onto a table and slashed his face with a knife, seriously injuring him.  The ambassador was then rushed to the hospital and endured 80 stitches and several hours of surgery to close his facial wound. South Korean doctors later said that Lippert narrowly survived the injury.   The assailant was soon identified as as pro-North Korean activist,  Kim Ki-jong, who was known to authorities due to a previous attempt to attack Japanese Ambassador Toshinori Shigeie, for which he received only a suspended sentence. As well, there was a long record of Kim Ki-jong's participation in anti-American protests.   In South Korea, activists with pro-Pyongyang sensibilities are few in number; however, they hold passionate beliefs about the contribution of foreign powers to the divisions between the Koreas.      South Korean  President Park Guen-hye condemned what she cast as an ""attack on the South Korea-U.S. alliance.""  However, the incident did not reflect well on her, the South Korean government, or South Korean security authorities. Indeed, there were vital questions arising about (1) the level of security at the high-level breakfast, and (2) the fact that the assailant -- with his known history -- was not only free, but permitted to attend a diplomatic breakfast attended by high ranking officials.   Meanwhile, North Korea entered the fray, lauding the act of violence and characterizing it as ""just punishment for U.S. warmongers.""  On behalf of the United States, Secretary of State John Kerry asserted that his country  would not be ""intimidated or deterred by threats or by anybody who harms any American diplomats.""  For his part, Ambassador Lippert exhibited great resilience, writing after surgery via the social media outlet, Twitter,   ""Doing well and in great spirits... Will be back ASAP to advance US-ROK [Republic of Korea] alliance!""

Special Note  Talks between two Koreas ends in agreement to de-escalate tensions after exchange of fire and North Korean move to ""war footing""  On Aug. 20, 2015, North Korea shelled across the border, prompting South Korea to retaliate with several rounds of artillery fire.   Reports indicated that North Korea carried out the initial burst of shelling in retaliation for anti-Pyongyang rhetoric that has been broadcast on loudspeakers from South Korea.  The broadcasts have generally be regarded as a type of psychological warfare against Pyongyang and intended to counteract the North's nationalist propaganda.  South Korea responded to North Korea's shelling, as noted here, by firing rounds of artillery.  North Korea did not immediately return fire, opting instead to warn South Korea to cease its broadcasts, which it viewed as a declaration of war, along the border area within 48 hours. North Korea warned that if South Korea did not heed its warning, it would take military action.  However, South Korean authorities said that the broadcasts would not be stopped, thus prompting the exchange of multiple rounds of fire -- none of which ended at this time with  any casualties.  The exchange of fire came after two South Korean soldiers died in a landmine blamed on  North Korea earlier in August 2015, and before annual joint military exercises between the United States and South Korea that North Korea regularly condemns as an act of aggression. As a result of these incidents and the impending joint military exercises, tensions were now markedly intensified between the two Koreas.  Given this unstable landscape,  South Korea moved to evacuate residents from   Yeoncheon in  the western sea  border. South Korea's National Security Council was also set to convene an emergency session.  Then, on Aug. 21, 2015,  in a disturbing escalation of tensions, the  North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, placed his country on ""war footing."" North Korean state media reported that after an emergency meeting of the central military commission, King Jong-un had ordered that North Korean troops be ""fully ready for any military operations at any time.""  While North Korea has often indulged in fiery militaristic rhetoric, this instance was regarded as more alarming since an exchange of fire had just taken place.  On Aug. 23, 2015, South Korean President Park Geun-hye released a statement in which she said that the anti-Pyongyang broadcasts would continue unless North Korea apologized for the landmine incident that killed two South Korean soldiers.  She said, ""We need a clear apology and measures to prevent a recurrence of these provocations and tense situations. Otherwise, this government will take appropriate steps and continue loudspeaker broadcasts.""  The program of cross-border broadcasts actually ended in 2004 but resumed in recent times as a result of North Korean aggression.  It was to be seen  how North Korea would respond to the South Korean leader's demand, and if  high level bilateral talks between the two sides -- presumably with an eye on decreasing tensions -- would yield productive results.   A day later on Aug. 24, 2015, following marathon negotiations between the two Koreas in the in the so-called  ""truce village"" of Panmunjom inside the demilitarized zone (DMZ), the two Koreas released a statement indicating they had reached an agreement to de-escalate tensions.  According to the statement, North Korea expressed ""regret"" over the deaths of two South Korean soldiers in the aforementioned landmine incident, stopping just short of taking responsibility for the loss of life.  North Korea also agreed to end its war footing, which had actually commenced in earnest.  For its part, South Korea agreed to end its cross-border loudspeaker broadcasts.  Also of note was the fact that North Korea and South Korea agreed to future  discussions on a range of issues, with an eye on diffusing tensions and improving bilateral ties.  The agreement could only be regarded as a positive development on the Korean peninsula, especially given the volatile personality of nuclear-armed North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un.  But Pyongyang officially applauded the agreement, with the state news agency noting that it had moved the  inter-Korean relations from a catastrophic path  on to ""the track of reconciliation and trust."" North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un, also lauded the accord between the two Koreas, calling it  ""a landmark occasion.""   On the other side of the border, South Korean President Park Geun-hye enjoyed a political boost from her handling of the North Korean crisis, according to survey data that showed a spike in her job  approval rating.  Of significance was the fact that the 1950-1953 war between the two Koreas ended with an armistice and not a peace treaty . As such, any escalation of tensions or movement to military action is generally regarded with gravity and alarm by countries of the region of eastern Asia.  Further deterioration in relations between the two Koreas  Relations on the Korean peninsula deteriorated in the period in early 2016 when North Korea carried out a hydrogen bomb test and launched a satellite into space, the latter of which was generally regarded as a ruse for a ballistic missile test.   The two actions were regarded as virulent acts of provocation, committed in flagrant contravention of international law,  and thus constituted a threat to regional -- if not global -- security, .     Tensions on the Korean peninsula deteriorated further in February 2016 when South Korea decided to suspend operations at the  Kaesong industrial zone, which has been jointly administered by the two Koreas and viewed as a venue for cooperation.  South Korea made the move in response to North Korea's provocative and belligerent actions, as noted just above.  But North Korea itself reacted by evicting all South Koreans from the   Kaesong industrial zone  and accusing South Korea of effectively ""declaring war.""   The Democratic People's Republic of Korea's (DPRK)   Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea released a statement that read as follows: ""Unpardonable is the puppet group's act of totally suspending the operation in (Kaesong), finding fault with the DPRK's H-bomb test and launch of a satellite.""  Agreement on draft resolution expanding sanctions against North Korea over nuclear activities  In late February 2016,  in response to North Korea's provocative nuclear activities in contravention of international law, the United States and China arrived at an agreement  intended to expand United Nations Security Council sanctions against that country.  In the aftermath of North Korea's hydrogen bomb test in January 2016,  Washington D. C. and  Beijing have been ensconced in  rigorous negotiations aimed at drafting a  draft resolution.   The two sides were not in complete agreement about what types of initiatives should be undertaken,  with Beijing favoring dialogue and advocating non-proliferation, and with Washington D.C. pushing for more stringent punitive  measures, including curbs on Pyongyang's ability to access the global financial system.  Other provisions being explored included mandatory inspections on cargo passing from or to North Korea, a  ban on all supplies of aviation and rocket fuel to North Korea,  and a ban on the transfer to North Korea of any item that could be used for military purposes.  Despite the distance on some of these items, Washington D. C. and  Beijing were finally able to find concurrence and craft the draft resolution, which they hoped would be introduced and  voted on in the full 15-member United Nations Security Council at the start of March 2016.

",649378,"General Relations Ayatollah Khomeini's revolutionary regime initiated sharp changes from the foreign policy pursued by the Shah, particularly in reversing the country's orientation toward the West. In broad terms, Iran's foreign policy was based on eliminating outside influence in the region; exporting the Islamic revolution; supporting Muslim political movements abroad; and increasing diplomatic contacts with developing countries. Foreign relations, however, were frequently contradictory due to Iran's oscillation between pragmatic and ideological concerns. 

The reformist President Khatami, who came to power in mid-1997, has attempted to improve Iran's relations with other states and has achieved some success. In particular, ambassador-level relations have been re-established with the United Kingdom, although the United Kingdom's alliance with the United States in the war on terror has recently hindered diplomatic relations between Iran and the United Kingdom. In March 1999, President Khatami met with Pope John Paul II at the Vatican; he was one of the senior most Islamic leaders to have met with the Pope. It was hoped that if the fragmented Iranian regime played its cards cohesively and courageously, the reformists in Iran could benefit from a rare window of opportunity to gain more friends in the international community.  Such an end was not to be realized very quickly, though. Since coming to power as president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has reversed Iran's diplomatic status in the global community.  Ahmadinejad's tirades against Israel, peppered with denials of the holocaust, as well as his championing of  a  nuclear program, have served to strain Iran's relations with traditional allies, such as Russia, while exacerbating already-poor relations with traditional antagonists, such as the United States.  Meanwhile, Ahmadinejad's controversial positions have offended and repelled many other members of the global community. Editor's Note:  Since early 2009, it was yet to be seen how the nuclear issue and the broader matter of foreign relations between Iran and other countries would be handled given the new balance of power in the United States.  United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, as the top diplomat for the new Obama administration, has signaled the possibility of  talks with Iran.  However, as of 2012, bilateral relations between the United States and Iran have not improved and little progress has been made on the issue of Iran's nuclear program. Regional Relations  Iran's regional goals are dominated by wanting to establish a leadership role, curtail the presence of the United States (U.S.) and other outside powers, and build trade ties. In the Middle East, Iran's only significant ally has been Syria.  Iran's relations with many of its Arab neighbors have been strained by Iranian attempts to spread its Islamic revolution. In 1981, Iran supported a plot to overthrow the Bahraini government. In 1983, Iran expressed support for Shiites who bombed Western embassies in Kuwait, and in 1987, Iranian pilgrims rioted during the ""Hajj"" (pilgrimage) in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. Nations with strong fundamentalist movements, such as Egypt and Algeria, also distrust Iran. In 1991, Iran declared its neutrality in the Iraqi-Kuwait conflict and, at the same time, used the conflict to improve relations with Egypt, Tunisia, Jordan and the Gulf States.  Iran has no diplomatic relations with Israel, and does not support the Middle East peace process in its current form. Ayatollah Khamenei has repeatedly called for the dismantlement of the Zionist regime, and the repatriation of all Palestinian refugees to their homeland. Iran backs several hard-line forces in the Arab world, such as Hezbollah, Hamas, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command.  In January 2002, Israeli authorities intercepted 50 tons of weapons on the Karine-A, a ship allegedly en route from Iran to the Palestinian Authority. Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon claimed that had the shipment actually arrived at its intended destination, the tide of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict could have significantly turned in favor of the Palestinians. Iran has vehemently condemned the Israeli offensive in 2002 and even called for a symbolic oil embargo against the U.S. and Israel as the conflict escalated in April 2002. Although Iran halted oil exports temporarily, it found little support from its regional neighbors.Throughout, Iran has made incendiary comments about Israel's right to exist.  Such language took on far stronger tones since Mahmoud Ahmadinejad became Iran's president.  Indeed, the Iranian president has consistently challenged Israel's right to exist and called for the Jewish state to be removed from the map.  As such, Iran's burgeoning nuclear program sparked red flags for Israel and the countries of the West. Indeed, such a program could threaten the very existence of Israel.  With diplomatic efforts failing (as discussed below and as discussed in the ""Political Conditions,"" speculation arose in late 2007 and into 2008 about the possibility of an Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear facility targets.  Such an end promised to plunge the region into chaos.Nevertheless by July 2009, United States Vice-President Joe Biden said in an interview with ABC News that has  the Obama administration would not stop  Israel from striking Iranian nuclear facilities.  Biden said that the United States would not  ""dictate to another sovereign nation what they can and cannot do.""  Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has suggested that his country would deal with the nuclear threat posed by Iran, if the government in Tehran was unwilling to enter negotiations.  For its part, Iran has said that it would guarantee a strong response if its facilities were attacked by Israel.At the beginning of November 2009, the Israeli navy intercepted a ship and seized the 300 tons of arms it was transporting aboard. According to Israeli intelligence, the arms were tracked for 2,500 miles and originated from Iran's port of Bandar Abbas.  The port has been known to be a base of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and has been linked with Hezbollah. Israeli, Lebanese and Cypriot sources also asserted that  the arms had been shipped from Bandar Abbas on an Iranian cargo ship called the Visea, which was itself owned by the state-run Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines. The Visea reported sailed in the Arabian Sea, moved north up the Red Sea, then traveled via the Suez Canal before docking in the Egyptian port of Damietta.  There, 36 containers were offloaded; within them were 3,000 Katyusha rockets, as well as a significant  number of hand grenades, artillery shells and other ammunition.  After remaining at Damietta for a week, the containers were then transferred to a German-owned vessel called the Francop, which flew an Antiguan flag.  That ship was ultimately destined for the Syrian port of Latakia.  Israel said that the ship's crew and German owners were unaware that the weapons were hidden behind other cargo.Israel has alleged that the arms were to be moved from Syria over land and ultimately delivered to Hezbollah.  Israel has thusly argued that this was the latest evidence that Iran has been arming Hezbollah and Hamas -- the two extremist groups that have been responsible for rocket attacks from the Palestinian territory of Gaza into Israeli territory.  But there have also been reports that Israel was emphasizing the Iranian arms connection to Hezbollah and Hamas in order to deflect attention from a scathing United Nations report, which accusing both Israel and Hamas of committing war crimes during a conflict in Gaza less than a year earlier.  Meanwhile, both Iran and Syria  have denied the transportation of arms, as alleged by Israel.See ""Political Conditions"" for further details about poor relations between these two countries.Over the last few years, Iran has improved formerly hostile relations with Gulf Arab countries, and pursued a policy of gradual rapprochement in regional relations. In 1998, the two countries formed a joint ministerial committee, and signed numerous agreements. In April 2001, Saudi Arabia and Iran signed a security cooperation pact, and issued a joint communiqué declaring that the two countries are the foremost nations in the region to bear common responsibility in solving regional issues. The Saudi rapprochement toward Iran has come in defiance of American pressure.Algeria and Iran reestablished relations during the United Nations (U.N.)  Millennium Summit in December 2000. Relations had been broken off after Iran criticized Algeria for canceling the 1993 parliamentary elections where Islamic parties were believed to have gained a substantial majority. Morocco and Iran have also strengthened bilateral ties, and Morocco's prime minister visited Iran in January 2001.Syria allied itself with the Iranians in their war with Iraq. Damascus cultivated close ties with Tehran under the rule of Hafez al-Assad, and this relationship continues under the current rule of his son, Bashar al-Assad. Syria and Iran share similar views on the Middle East peace process and support for Hezbollah in Lebanon, a country where Syria is the main foreign broker. Both Syria and Iran have taken reconciliatory steps towards the former enemy, Iraq.Tension between Iran and Iraq escalated in September 1980, when Iraq invaded Iran. Much of the dispute focused on sovereignty over the waterway between the two countries, the Shatt al-Arab, although underlying causes included each state's desire for the overthrow of the other's government. Iran demanded the withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Iranian territory, as well as the return to the status quo for the Shatt al-Arab, as established under the 1975 Algiers Agreement signed by Iraq and Iran. After eight punishing years of war, in July 1988, Iran agreed to United Nations Security Council Resolution 598, which called for a cease-fire. The cease-fire was implemented on Aug. 20, 1988; neither state made any real gains in the war. Iran has worked to improve the hostile relationship with Iraq, as well as other Gulf Arab states.Since August 2000, Iran released prisoners of war from the Iran-Iraq war, and the two countries also exchanged bodies of soldiers. Thave been a number of attempts from both Tehran and Baghdad to reestablish ties. Nevertheless, relations remain tense between the two countries.  The closeness of United States forces in Iraq in a time following the invasion of that country in 2003 has hardly helped to thaw bilateral relations between the neighbors.Still, with a predominantly Shi'a majority coming to power in Iraq following the ousting of Saddam Hussein's regime there, Iran has actively courted a closer relationship with its neighbor.Indeed, in 2007,  Iran's ambassador to Iraq, Hassan Kazemi Qumi, delineated the details of a plan to strongly expand his country's economic and military ties with Iraq.  He noted that Iran was prepared to offer its neighbor military training, equipment and advisory staff in order to bolster Iraq's efforts in ""the security fight.""  As well, Qumi said that Iran was ready to bear greater responsibility as regards Iraq's economic reconstruction.  Qumi's remarks were made in an interview at the Iranian embassy in Baghdad, which was published by the New York Times.  Iran's desire to intensify ties with Iraq was not met positively by the United States.Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki  visited Tehran in early June 2008 and met with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as well as Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki. The Iraqi leader offered assuances  that his country would not be used to launch attacks against Iran.  The Iranian state-controlled media reported Maliki as saying, ""We will not allow Iraq to become a platform for harming the security of Iran and neighbors.""  Maliki also reportedly said, ""A stable Iraq will be a benefit to the security of the region and the world.""  On the other side of the equation, Ahmadinejad promised to assist with Iraq's security. Trade and economic issues also factored highly during the meeting.In the background of these developments has been the fact that the United States and Iraq were in the process of discussing the provisions of a treaty on the future of the United States military in Iraq.  While the Iranian leader did not directly discuss this issue during talks with his Iraqi counterpart, President Ahmadinejad presented an oblique reference to United States' influence in Iraq saying, ""Iraq must reach a certain level of stability so that its enemies are not able to impose their influence.""Thus, the meeting in Tehran was likely to have repercussions for Iraq-United States relations, given the already acrimonious nature of the relationship between its neighbor,  Iran, and its ally, the United States.  In addition to the possibility of a continued United States military presence in Iraq,  the United States has also accused Iran of supporting militants in Iraq.  Furthermore, the United States has been the leading voice against Iran's burgeoning nuclear program.  These issues have caused the already-poor bilateral relations between Iran and the United States to devolve into even more hostile territory.  As such,  Iraq has stood in the awkward position of being  an ally of the United States, while also strengthening its bonds with its Shi'a Muslim neighbor in the post-Saddam Hussein era.Iran has been locked in a territorial conflict with the United Arab Emirates over three islands (Abu Mussa, Greater and Lesser Tunbs) since 1971, when British colonial forces withdrew from the region. Iran currently controls the strategically located and potentially oil-rich islands. A committee consisting of the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Oman was set up in July 1999 in order to mediate the conflict but has achieved little as Iran refuses third party intervention. In December 2000, the Gulf Cooperation Council, or GCC, angered Iran by issuing a communique backing the UAE claim. The GCC encourage the two countries to solve the conflict peacefully and to refer the dispute to the International Court of Justice at The Hague. In August 2001, a high-level Iranian delegation visited the UAE in order to discuss the disputed islands and other bilateral issues. While no solution emerged, the overall climate between the two countries is positive, and both parties have committed themselves to a peaceful solution to the dispute.Iran had never formally recognized the Taliban regime of neighboring Afghanistan, and relations with the Sunni regime were hostile. In 1998, 11 Iranian diplomats were killed when Taliban forces captured the city of Mazar-e Sharif. The border between the two countries has been volatile. Iran hosts an estimated two million Afghan refugees at a large economic and social cost. Iran is a major transit route for drugs smuggled to the West from Afghanistan and Pakistan, and also has a large domestic drug-problem with an estimated two million drug-addicts. Over the last two decades, around 3,000 Iranian soldiers have been killed in actions to curb the drug smuggling. Iran had loathed the Taliban for its extremist version of Islam and welcomed the replacement of the Taliban regime. A more stable Afghanistan would hopefully calm the border between the two countries, stop the flow of refugees and reduce drug-trafficking.Iran has a high stake in the securing stability in Afghan and voiced its own view on how the Afghan interim government should be set up. Iran is uneasy about a Western influence in its neighboring country especially if the influence is drawn from the United States.Although Iran did not support the bombing campaign in Afghanistan it did lend support to the post-Taliban government. Iran was a constructive diplomatic player in the Bonn Accord and United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan highly commended Iran for its role. In early 2002, Iran pledged over $500 million over the next five years for the reconstruction of Afghanistan and it still continues to maintain its support for the people of Afghanistan.In 2007,  Afghan President Hamid Karzai was in the United States to meet with President George W. Bush.  The meeting was regarded as a ""strategy session"" regarding the resurgent Taliban and al-Qaida in Aghanistan. However, in the background of that objective was the issue of Iran.  Whereas the United States expressed anxiety about Iran possible involvement in the supply of weapons to the Taliban, Afghanistan has cast Iraq as an ally in its causes.  To that end, Karzai was reported to have characterized Iran as ""a supporter of Afghanistan, in the peace process that we have and the fight against terror.""On October 18, 2009, a suicide bombing left at least 35 people dead and another 30 injured in Iran.  Among the dead were five senior officers of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard Corps, including Nour Ali Shoushtari -- the deputy head of the Revolutionary Guard Corps' ground forces -- who was mediating talks between Iranian Shi'ites and Sunnis in Sarbaaz in south-eastern Sistan-Baluchistan.  That area of Sistan-Baluchistan has been predominantly inhabited by the Baluchi ethnic group -- a Sunni Muslim minority in Shi'a-ruled Iran.While some voices in Iran at first placed the blame on the United States for the attack, Iran later accused Pakistan  of being behind the suicide bombing.  Indeed, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  said that Pakistani agents were behind the violence and demanded that the Pakistani government arrest those responsible.  Emerging reports have suggested that the Sunni resistance group, Jundullah, might have carried out the attack. However, the Pakistani foreign office has denied claims by Iran that Jundullah's leader was in Pakistan.Other Significant RelationsRelations with Russia and the Newly Independent StatesIran maintains regular diplomatic and commercial relations with Russia and the other newly independent states of the former Soviet Union. Both Iran and Russia feel they have important national interests at stake in Central Asia and the Trans-Caucasus. Under a secret agreement from 1995, Russia was banned from selling destabilizing weapons and high technology to Iran. In November 2000, Russia announced that it no longer would observe the agreement. The Iranian and Russian defense ministers met in December 2000, and held serious discussions on security related issues. Tehran is believed to have been offered access to military hardware worth around $7 billion over the next three to five years. The meeting was the first visit by a Russian defense minister since the 1979 Iranian revolution. Russian sales of military equipment and technology and the close relationship between the two countries is perceived as threatening in the Gulf, as well as by America's European allies.Ongoing negotiations over dividing water, oil and gas rights in the Caspian Sea has led to controversy between Iran, Russia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. They all seek to gain access to the area holding billions of dollars worth of oil. Iran has also been angered by Russian naval war games staged in the northern part of the Caspian Sea.In early 2005, the nuclear issue took center stage as Iran and Russia signed an agreement by which Moscow would supply fuel for Iran's new nuclear reactor in Bushehr. Under the terms of the agreement, Iran must return spent nuclear fuel rods from the reactor, which had been designed and built by Russia. This condition was implemented in response to growing anxiety by the United States, Israel and others about Iran's nuclear ambitions.

Against the backdrop of this development was a meeting in Slovakia between Russian President Vladimir Putin and United States President George W. Bush in which both leaders agreed that Iran should not develop nuclear weapons. Russia, however, refused to acquiesce to United States's pressure to completely halt cooperation with Iran on nuclear power.       Two years later, there was little progress on the issue, with the United States growing more impatient with Iran's refusal to end its nuclear ambitions, and with Russia disinclined to take as strong a stand with Iran as the United States would have liked.       In 2007, Russian President Vladimir Putin was set to travel to Iran to attend a summit of the leaders of Caspian Sea countries despite of reports of a possible assassination plot against him there.  Russian media reported that suicide bombers were planning to kill the Russian head of state during his visit to the Iranian capital of Tehran. Some Russian sources acknowledged that the threats likely contained some degree of reliability.  However, the Iranian Foreign Ministry said that there was no basis in fact to the reports.  Nevertheless, during a news conference in Germany, Putin dismissed rumors that he might cancel his visit amidst the threats saying, ""Of course I'm going."" That said, the Russian leader's arrival in Iran for was delayed by one day to October 16, 2007.       Putin  also confirmed that the issue of Iran's controversial nuclear program would be on the agenda for discussion.  To that end, he urged a peaceful resolution to the matter and called for patience on the part pf the international community in resolving the dispute.  He noted that threatening Iran would be futile since Iran and its people were not scared.

Putin would be the first Russian leader to visit Iran since Stalin visited that country during the Soviet era in 1943.      

See below under ""Editor's Update"" for latest details related to relations with Russia.Relations with EuropeRelations with Western European nations have alternated between improvements and setbacks. French-Iranian relations were badly strained by the sale of French arms to Iraq. Since the war, relations have improved commercially but have periodically been worsened by Iranian-sponsored terrorist acts committed in France.In 1989, Ayatollah Khomeini issued a ""fatwa"" (edict) imposing the death sentence on Salman Rushdie for comments made about Islam in his book, ""The Satanic Verses."" This resulted in a worsening of relations between Iran and United Kingdom  (U.K.) and aneventual end to diplomatic relations between the two countries. It was not until September 1990 that the U.K. government made a statement saying that, indeed, the book by Salman Rushdie had insulted Muslims, and that the British government had no desire to insult either Islam or Iran. Consequently, diplomatic relations between the two states were re-opened, but only at the level of charge d'affaires.In 1993, talks took place between the U.K. and Iran to discuss the possibility of raising diplomatic relations to ambassadorial level, but in April 1994, relations again deteriorated when the British government claimed Iran had links to the Irish Republican Army. In 1997, talks began again in earnest between the European Community, the U.K. and Iran to try and come to a compromise about the fatwa against Rushdie, but no settlement was reached.In September 1998, however, the U.K. and Iran agreed to exchange ambassadors. This breakthrough in relations was largely due to Iran's rescinding of the $2.5 million dollar reward for Salman Rushdie and its assertion that, while it could not revoke the fatwa, it would not actively pursue it. (Iran cannot revoke the fatwa, because only the Ayatollah Khomeini has the authority to do so, and he has since passed away.) However, in February 2002, Iran rejected David Reddaway, who had been nominated as the new British Ambassador to Iran. Later, Richard John Dalton was named to that post.On Aug. 21, 2003, Iranian diplomat Hade Soleimanpour was arrested in the U.K. -- prompting Iran to temporarily recall its ambassador to Britain, Morteza Sarmadi. Soleimanpour's extradition was being sought by Argentina in connection with the bombing of a Jewish center in Buenos Aires in 1994, when he was Iranian ambassador there. The blast killed 85 people. Iranian president Mohammad Khatami demanded Soleimanpour's release and an apology from Britain.The dispute further strained relations between the two countries. In September 2003, British Embassy officials protested to the Iranian government over a shooting incident outside their embassy in Tehran. The embassy had closed the week before when six shots were fired into the building. Meanwhile British officials called the shootings a failure of Iran's duty under the Vienna Conventions on diplomatic missions.Around the same time as the criticism from the IAEA arose in 2004, according to Iran's Revolutionary Guards, three navy vessels from the United Kingdom entered Iranian territorial waters located close to the Iraqi border without permission.  The Iranian Foreign Ministry in Tehran said the vessels were seized and that eight of the sailors on board were arrested.  For its part, the United Kingdom's Ministry of Defense in London confirmed it had lost contact with three patrol vessels in the area but it did not confirm the identities of the persons arrested by the Iranian authorities.  Diplomats from the United Kingdom were in contact with Iranian officials for the purpose of resolving the matter.In 2007, this issue re-emerged when 15 members of the British Navy were captured by members of Iranian forces.  The incident occurred when the British Navy personnel boarded a vessel just off the coast of Iraq on the basis of suspected smuggling activities.  The servicemen from the HMS Cornwall were apparently seized by gunpoint by Iran's Revolutionary Guard.  British Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett demanded both the immediate and safe return of the servicemen, as well as a ""full explanation"" from Iran about its actions.

The Iranian government subsequently said that the British Navy had illegally entered Iranian waters.   However, the British government countered this claim saying that its Navy personnel were conducting routine patrols in Iraqi waters.  To this end, British Prime Minister Tony Blair said, ""It simply is not true that they went into Iranian territorial waters and I hope the Iranian government understands how fundamental an issue this is for us.""  Blair also characterized the detention of the 15 members of the Royal Navy as ""unjustified and wrong.""

It was yet to be seen how Iran would react, given the fact that the diplomatic climate abroad, as well as the political climate at home, were not particularly favorable in March 2007.  First, new sanctions were being imposed by the United Nations (U.N.) Security Council on Iran in regard to its nuclear program.  As well, students at home were reacting to the government's claims about the Royal Navy personnel entry into Iranian waters by calling for them to face trial.

Days later, Iranian authorities published excerpts of letters by Leading Seaman Faye Turney -- one of the Royal Navy personnel captured.  In the letters, Turney allegedly wrote that she was sorry that she and her fellow Royal Navy servicemen entered Iranian waters.  On March 28, 2007, Iranian state television showed an interview with Turney in which she said, ""Obviously we trespassed"" into Iranian waters.  Nevertheless, Iran said that Turney would be released within days.

British officials responded saying that they expected that Turney had been forced to express such a position, and they did not believe the letters or interview statements were willingly offered.  As well, Prime Minister Blair told the House of Commons that the time had come to ""ratchet up"" pressure on Iran.  Earlier, Blair warned of a ""different phase"" in diplomatic efforts if current initiatives to free the 15 crew members failed.  Meanwhile, the Royal Navy offered Global Positioning Systems (GPS) evidence making clear that the 15 crew members, who were functioning under a United Nations mandate, were 1.7 nautical miles inside Iraqi waters when they were seized.

On March 29, 2007, following a request by the United Kingdom (U.K.), the United Nations Security Council issued a statement conveying  ""grave concern"" for the capture of the British Navy personnel by Iran, and calling on Iran to ensure that the U.K. received consular access. 

For its part, Iran released video footage depicting the 15 British crew members being seized in what it has claimed to be Iranian waters.  Iran also announced that it was freezing the scheduled release of Leading Seaman Turney on the basis of the U.K.'s supposed ""incorrect attitude.""

A day later, Iranian state television aired an interview with a second British Royal Navy serviceman, Nathan Summers.  In that footage, Summer apologized for ""trespassing"" in Iranian waters.  Prime Minister Blair disparaged the footage, saying that the exploitation of the British crew would serve only to ""enhance people's sense of disgust with Iran.""

On the diplomatic front, Iran sent a formal note to the U.K. in which it condemned the Royal Navy's ""illegal act"" and called for guarantees that such trespassing would not be repeated.  Meanwhile, the European Union expressed ""unconditional support"" for the position of the U.K. and urged the ""immediate and unconditional release"" of the 15 Royal Navy personnel.

On April 1, 2007, two other Royal Navy servicemen were shown on Iranian state television.  Captain Chris Ayre and Lieutenant Felix Carman were respectively shown in front of an Iranian map of the Gulf.  Ayre noted that the Iranian maps depicted the area in which he and his associates were captured as Iranian territorial waters.  He said, ""Approximately about ten o'clock in the morning we were seized - apparently at this point here from their maps on the GPS they've shown us - which is inside Iranian territorial waters.""  Carman expressed understanding for the Iranian perspective about the ""intrusion."" 

On the ground in Iran, hard-line students hurled rockets and firecrackers into the compound housing the British embassy, presumably to protest the brewing dissention between the two countries.  As well, about 200 students took to the streets to demonstrate against the alleged trespassing by the British Navy personnel into Iranian waters. 

On the other side of the equation, the British Foreign Office decried the televised footage and characterized it as both ""a charade"" and ""unacceptable.""  The statement by the British Foreign Office included the following assertion: ""It is completely unacceptable for these pictures to be shown on television, given the potential to cause distress to their families."" A day later, the climate appeared to have calmed somewhat, despite the airing of new footage of the 15 who had been detained.Iran noted that a shift from the U.K. could help to resolve the crisis, and in so doing refined its hard-line tone.  Meanwhile, the U.K. Defense Secretary Des Browne said that diplomatic efforts to end the crisis were ongoing, and that London and Tehran were engaging in ""direct bilateral communication."" On  April 4, 2007, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmandinejad held a media conference in Tehran.  At that media event, which was held to present medals of honor to the Republican Guard who had detained the British crew members, he also announced that the British Navy servicemen would be given amnesty and released.  He intimated that the decision was gesture of goodwill to the British,  and that it was being offered in honor of two upcoming events -- the  birthday of the Islamic Prophet Mohammed and  the Christian celebration of Easter.  Iranian state television showed Ahmadinejad greeting the 15 servicemen in what appeared to be a climate of amity.Some analysts characterized the display as being ""a piece of theater.""Regardless, British Prime Minister Tony Blair reacted to the news saying that the release of the 15 Britons would be ""a profound relief"" to the crew and their families. On the diplomatic front, the Iranian leader said that no concessions or deals had been made with the British government to secure the release of the 15 servicemen, although the U.K. made it clear that such an incident would not be repeated.  Meanwhile, the British prime minister did not offer either an apology to Iran for the alleged intrusion into Iranian waters, or thanks for the release of the British Navy personnel.  However, Blair addressed the Iranian people saying,  ""We bear you no ill will. On the contrary, we respect Iran as an ancient civilisation, as a nation with a proud and dignified history. The disagreements we have with your government we wish to resolve peacefully through dialogue. I hope - as I've always hoped - that in the future we are able to do so."" Bilateral relations between London and Tehran have remained strained over human rights, nuclear proliferation as well as policies regarding the Middle East.  Relations took a particularly negative turn since the post-election crackdown in 2009, as discussed in the ""Political Conditions"" of this review.  Meanwhile, relations with Germany suffered a severe setback in 1997 when a German court ruled that senior Iranian officials were involved in the murder of Iranian Kurdish dissident exiles at a restaurant in Berlin in 1992. Later in 1997, a German businessman, Helmut Hofer, was arrested and initially sentenced to death for an alleged affair with an Iranian Muslim woman. Hofer was released in January 2000, and in July President Khatami went on a three-day trip to Germany. Khatami's visit was the first of an Iranian head of state to Germany since 1967. The visit was hoped to improve relations and trade with Europe, as well as Iran's image in the West.  European nations generally have not agreed with United States in considering Iran as part of the ""Axis of Evil,"" as designated by United States President George W. Bush. The European Union has been nurturing relations with Iran believing that, aside from economic and political gains from such a relationship, Iran is an important player in the fight against global terrorism. The United States does not necessarily share this view  and the development of nuclear abilities by Iran in recent years has done nothing to build Iran's standing with the West.  From 2004 to the present, the issue of  nuclear development was at the forefront of relations between Europe and Iran. In particular, the European Union has tried to strike the balance in negotiations with Iran whereby the country's need for nuclear energy is respected, while at the same time, the development of nuclear weaponry is discouraged.In September 2007,  French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said that the world should prepare for war over the Iran's atomic activities.  In a media interview, Kouchner observed that while negotiations with Iran should be fully exhausted before embarking on a new course, the world should be ready for a worst case scenario if such talks were ultimately unsuccessful.  To this end, he warned, ""We have to prepare for the worst, and the worst is war.""  He also noted that Iran armed with nuclear weapons would present ""a real danger for the whole world.""  Signaling that France had taken a position in the debate over Iran burgeoning nuclear program, Kouchner said that many French companies had been asked not to do business with Iraq.  Making clear that no prohibitions had been established, the French Foreign Minister noted that French enterprises have been advised not to do so.  As well, he made clear that France was in favor of European Union sanctions against Iran.

French President Sarkozy had earlier characterized war with Iran as ""catastrophic"" and French Prime Minister Fillon noted that all avenues would be exhausted in resolving the matter diplomatically. 

See ""Editor's Note"" below for latest developments related to Iran's controversial nuclear program and the international community's reaction.  Relations with Japan and China  Iran also cooperates closely with Japan, a large oil importer. In November 2000, the two countries signed a deal allowing Japan priority-bidding rights to develop Iran's largest oil field, the Azadeban oil field in southwestern Iran.  Sino-Iranian relations have gradually been strengthened since the 1979 revolution. Iran and China have signed cooperation agreements in the fields of culture, economy, trade, transportation, energy and telecommunications.  Relations with the United States  On Nov. 4, 1979, militant Iranian students occupied the American embassy in Tehran with the support of Ayatollah Khomeini. For 444 days, 52 Americans were held hostage. On April 7, 1980, the United States (U.S.) broke diplomatic relations with Iran, and on April 24, 1981, the Swiss government assumed representation of U.S. interests in Tehran.  The Pakistani government represented Iranian interests in the United States. In accordance with the Algiers declaration of Jan. 20, 1981, the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal (located in The Hague, Netherlands) was established for the purpose of handling claims of U.S. nationals against Iran and of Iranian nationals against the United States. U.S. contact with Iran through The Hague covers only legal matters.  In 1996 the U.S. Congress passed the Iran Libya Sanctions Act. The act gives the U.S. president discretionary power to impose sanctions on any individual or company anywhere in the world that invests more than $20 million or more in an Iranian or Libyan oil or gas project.  Commercial relations between Iran and the United States consist mainly of Iranian purchases of food and manufactured products. In 1999 the U.S. allowed import of Iranian caviar, pistachios and carpets. The U.S. government prohibits the export of military and dual-use items to Iran as well as items forbidden under anti-terrorism legislation; it prohibits all imports from Iran. In August 2000 Iranian and American legislators met for the first time in what was the highest level meeting between the two countries since 1979.  Iranian officials expressed optimism regarding the new Republican administration, due to its close ties to the oil industry. Iranian leaders hoped for a reversal of U.S. policies towards the country and stated that they were willing to adjust their policy towards the U.S. in return. Iran is in need of foreign investment, and would welcome American, as well as other foreign businesses. While it was widely expected that the Bush administration would ease the sanctions on Iran, this has not happened. On June 20, 2001, the U.S. Congress voted to extend ILSA for a second five-year period. The vote reflected continued skepticism toward Iran based on the country's continued support of terrorism (the U.S. State Department labeled Iran as the world's ""most active state-sponsor of terrorism in 2000""), Iran's presumed capability to develop weapons of mass destruction, its vocal opposition to the current form of the Middle East peace process, and support for the latest Palestinian Intifada.  Iran strongly condemned the attacks on New York and Washington D.C. on Sept. 11, 2001, but has not joined the U.S.-led coalition against terrorism. Iran strongly criticized the bombing of Afghanistan, and in an interview with CNN on November 12, President Khatami said that the ""roots of terrorism must be examined before it can be stopped,"" and urged the U.S to examine its policies.After President Bush's declaration of Iran as part of an ""Axis of Evil"" in January 2002, it appears highly unlikely that diplomatic relations will improve under the Bush administration. Bush's accusation not only shocked and offended Iran, it shocked much of the world, and many countries involved in the fight against terrorism do not support the United States' claims.While the U.S. has verbally extended an invitation for diplomatic talks between the two countries, Iran has officially expressed strong resistance to the idea. While there are some in the reformist camps who would still welcome a breakthrough in diplomatic dialogue, Iranian hardliners are adamant in their position. In May 2002, the Iranian Justice Department went as far as to declare it illegal for newspapers to print articles supporting the idea of U.S.-Iranian talks. In that same month, the U.S. Department of State accused Iran as being the world's most active sponsor of terrorism.By September 2003, the U.S. declared that Iran had clearly violated its United Nations nuclear safeguards obligations. However, the U.S. did say it was willing ""to give Iran a last chance to stop its evasions."" Iran continued to deny its uranium enrichment activities are part of an illegal weapons program. Meanwhile, the United Nations' International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was considering setting an October deadline for Iran to fully comply with its obilgations under the international nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT.)By late 2005 and into 2007, the nuclear issue had found no resolution.  Indeed, United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice applied harsh words toward Iran's nuclear development while Iranian officials continued to defend Iran's right to develop nuclear power for peaceful -- and if necessary -- defensive purposes.In early 2007, as noted above Iran's ambassador to Iraq, Hassan Kazemi Qumi, delineated the details of a plan to strongly expand his country's economic and military ties with Iraq.  The Iranian ambassador also addressed the detainment of Iranians by United States forces in Iraq, acknowledging that they were, indeed, security officials.Qumi explained that the Iranian security officials were in Iraq to meet with counterparts in the context of a bilateral agreement to resolve security.  As such, he argued that the Iranians should never have been detained in the first place.  Additionally, Qumi dismissed United States' claims that Iranians were involved in the orchestration of attacks against Iraqi and American forces.For its part, however, the United States has maintained the view that there is a mountain of evidence pointing toward Iran's support for militants inside Iraq, even providing bombs and weaponry.  United States President George W. Bush warned that his country's forces  would ""respond firmly"" in response to Iran's alleged activities in Iraq.  Bush also said, ""It makes sense that if somebody is trying to harm our troops or stop us from achieving our goal, or killing innocent citizens in Iraq, that we will stop them,""  His words appeared to be evidence  of the growing and very public standoff between Washington and Tehran.  Bush additionally responded to the Iranian ambassador's plan to expand ties with Iraq with skepticism.To date, the government of Iraq has expressed dismay that it has been caught in the metaphoric cross-fire of hostilities between Iran and the United States.  As such, Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki called on both parties to deal with their hostilities outside of Iraq.  To this end, he said, ""We have told the Iranians and the Americans, 'We know that you have a problem with each other, but we are asking you, please solve your problems outside Iraq.' ""September 23, 2007 saw Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad arrive in the United States to attend the meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, and also to speak at a forum at Columbia University.Ahmadinejad's visit was met with protests, most especially by opponents of his speaking engagement at Columbia University.  He had originally intended to lay a wreath at the site of the September 11, 2001 terror attack in New York, however, police cited security concerns in denying that request.

In a television interview on the American network CBS for the show, ""60 Minutes,"" the Iranian president took a measured tone  and said that his country was not building nuclear weaponry.  To that end, President Ahmadinejad said, ""Well, you have to appreciate we don't need a nuclear bomb. We don't need that. What need do we have for a bomb?"" He continued,  ""In political relations right now, the nuclear bomb is of no use. If it was useful it would have prevented the downfall of the Soviet Union.""  President Ahmadinejad also noted that Iran was not embarking on a path to war with the United States, saying,  ""It's wrong to think that Iran and the U.S. are walking toward war. Who says so? Why should we go to war? There is no war in the offing.""

These assertions were a departure from President Ahmadinejad's announcement several days prior in which he harshly issued a warning to any countries considering military  attacks against Iran.   Indeed, an Iranian air force official noted that if, in a worse case scenario, Iran was attacked by Israel, it had the capacity to respond with air and missile raids.

On the other side of the equation, the Bush administration in the United States repeatedly noted that although it intended to deal with Iran diplomatically, all possible options remained on the proverbial table.  Meanwhile, the head of United States Central Command, Admiral William Fallon, observed that the emotional rhetoric was not productive.  In an interview with al-Jazeera television, he said, ""This constant drum beat of conflict is what strikes me, which is not helpful and not useful.""

Iran and the United States have enjoyed poor relations over the years, and bilateral relations were at an all-time low over the United States' opposition to Iran's nuclear ambitions.  Adding to the tensions were the accusations by the United States that Iran was assisting Shi'ite militias in Iraq.  These allegations were disputed by the Iranian government, which assured its Iraqi counterpart that no such actions were ongoing.The United States (U.S.) Pentagon said on January 7, 2008 that five Iranian boats threatened five  U.S. navy ships in the Strait of Hormuz, which has functioned as a major oil transportation route. The Pentagon said that the Iranian vessels approached and threatened to blow up the U.S. ships in what the U.S. said were international waters.  When those U.S. ships prepared to open fire, the Iranian vessels -- believed to belong to the Revolutionary Guard -- withdrew.  The U.S. authorities said that Iran's  ""provocative actions""  could  very well ""lead to a dangerous incident in the future.""  For its part, Iran dismissed the incident as routine saying that the matter was resolved once both sides were able to identify one another.  In 2007, a similar incident resulted in the detainment of 15 British sailors for two weeks.Years after deeming Iran to be part of the ""axis of evil,"" the United States'  Bush administration in July 2008 offered no denial of reports that it would establish a diplomatic presence in Iran.  According to the British newspaper, the Guardian, the United States was set to open an interests section in the Iranian capital of  Tehran.Since the hostage crisis of 1979, the United Sates has not had a diplomatic presence in Iran.

The United States Department of State released a statement by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, which noted  that while the United States was not changing its policy in regard to the Iranian government, it was interested in outreach to ordinary Iranians.  That said, the United States was slated to convene talks with Iran in Geneva.  It would be the first time in three decades that a high ranking American diplomat would be involved in such a meeting with Iranian counterparts.  At that meeting, the United  States reinforced its position on Iran's nuclear program, noting that Iranian obstinacy on the matter would lead to a heightened sanctions regime.Relations between the two countries took a more difficult track following the post-election crackdown, as discussed in the ""Political Conditions"" of this review.Then, in July 2009, United States Vice-President Joe Biden said in an interview with ABC News that has  the Obama administration would not stop  Israel from striking Iranian nuclear facilities.  Biden said that the United States would not  ""dictate to another sovereign nation what they can and cannot do.""  Biden also said  that President Barack Obama's overture  of engagement with Iran remained on the table.  That offer for talks would end at the close of 2009.  Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has suggested that his country would deal with the nuclear threat posed by Iran, if the government in Tehran was unwilling to enter negotiations.  For its part, Iran has said that it would guarantee a strong response if its facilities were attacked by Israel.  In an interview with  the American television station, NBC News, in September 2011,  Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  said that two American hikers jailed for spying in Iran would soon be released. In a separate interview with the Washington Post, President Ahmadinehad explained that the release would be permitted  as ""a humanitarian gesture.""

The hikers -- Shane Bauer and Joshua Fattal -- have been in Iranian custdy since their arrest in 2009, and were sentenced to prison for eight years in mid-2011.  That harsh sentences for the two Americans raised already-poor relations between Iran and the United States, especially since the Obama administration has strenuously denied that Bauer and Fattal were involved in any  intelligence activities.  A third hiker, Sara Shourd, was arrested along with Bauer and Fattal, but was released  in September 2010 on medical and humanitarian grounds. Now a year later, the Iranian authorities were indicating that the two men could also be released after paying bail of $500,000 each.

In response to the news, United states Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that she was encouraged and noted, ""We hope we will see a positive outcome from what appears to be a decision by the [Iranian] government.""  The decision to release the two Americans came ahead of a visit by President Ahmadinejad to the United States for a meeting of the United Nations General Assembly on Sept. 22, 2011.On Nov. 24, 2011, according to the state-run IRNA news agency, Iran announced it had broken up an American spy network and that 12 individuals had been arrested. Iranian officials claimed that the 12 individuals were ""spies"" working on behalf of the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to undermine the country's military and its nuclear program. No information was available about the identity or nationality of the dozen so-called agents. Parviz Sorouri, an influential member of the  National Security and Foreign Policy Committee in the Iranian parliament, was reported to have said that the agents were working cooperatively with Israel's Mossad.  He was quoted in international media having said, ""The US and Zionist regime's espionage apparatuses were trying to use regional intelligence services, both inside and outside Iran, in order to deal a strong blow to our country. Fortunately, these steps failed due to the quick measures taken by Intelligence Ministry officials."" Iranian officials have further alleged that the United States has recruited spies from diplomatic missions in Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, and Malaysia.See ""Editor's Note"" below for latest developments related to Iran's nuclear program and engagement with the international community on this matter.Editor's Note on the Nuclear IssueIn early August 2008, only a day after the United States and the United Kingdom warned that Iran would face a heightened sanctions regime if it did not respond positively to prevailing proposals on how to deal with its controversial nuclear program, the government of Iran offered an ambiguous response to the European Union (EU).

At issue was a ""freeze for freeze""  offer put forth a week earlier by EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana that Iran halt its uranium enrichment program, while international powers would refrain from imposing further economic sanctions.  A deadline was set for a response by Iran, which Iranian chief nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili said his country would meet by tendering a formal response on Aug. 5, 2008.To that end, Iran did indeed sent a message to Solana.  However, it was unclear if that message was an actual response to prevailing proposals on Iran's nuclear ambitions.Solana's office confirmed that a letter from Iran had been received but did not furnish any details, saying instead that it would study the contents of the missive.

A spokesperson for the Iranian Supreme National Security Council told Agence France Press that the message did not pertain to the incentives package  that had been  offered by the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (the United States, the United Kingdom,  China, Russia, France) as well as Germany in June 2008,  which was aimed at halting Iran's  nuclear enrichment activities.Late September 2008 saw the United Nations  Security Council  unanimously approve a new resolution on Iran.  United Nations  Security Council  resolution 1835  reified previous demands that Iran halt its uranium enrichment activities but did not expressly impose new sanctions.Instead, the resolution asserts that Iran must ""comply, and without delay, with its obligations"" set forth in previous  resolutions; it also urges Iran to  co-operate with the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).  There were no new sanctions in the resolution due to Russia's objections to such a move.The resolution came a week after the IAEA said that it was unable to provide assurances about Iran's controversial nuclear development program due to a lack of information.

Iran responded to this action by the United Nations by disregarding the edict and, instead,  making it clear that it would not  stop enriching uranium.  Iran, as before, also maintained that its nuclear development activities have been for peaceful purposes.Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, Saeed Jalili, characterized the new resolution as unconstructive.  Moreover, Jalili warned that the new resolution would only create further ""mistrust"" and would hinder the fostering of international  peace,  security and productive cooperation at the global level.As of early 2009, it was yet to be seen how the nuclear issue and the broader matter of foreign relations between Iran and other country would be handled given the new balance of power in the United States.  United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, as the top diplomat for the new Obama administration, has signaled the possibility of  talks with Iran.That said, on February 20, 2009, a new report by the United Nations' nuclear watchdog entity, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), asserted that Iran was understating how much uranium it had enriched, and that it had built up a stockpile of nuclear fuel. According to reports by Reuters, the discrepancy in the amount of uranium believed to have been enriched and the amount enriched in actuality was not due to subterfuge by Iran, but rather, a result of a technical mistake.

The Obama administration in the United States expressed concern over these revelations and called on the international community to address the matter with urgency. White House spokesperson, Robert Gibbs said, ""The report represents another lost opportunity for Iran as it continues to renege on its international obligations.""On March 1, 2009, the United States senior military commander, Admiral Mike Mullen, said that Iran had enough nuclear material to manufacture a bomb. In an interview on the cable network CNN, the chairman of the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff said, ""We think they do, quite frankly. And Iran having a nuclear weapon, I've believed for a long time, is a very, very bad outcome for the region and for the world."" This assertion by Mullen came two weeks after the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in report that Tehran had increased its stockpile of fissile nuclear material.

There were some analysts, such as David Albright, president of Washington-based  Institute for Science and International Security, have said that the Iranian stockpile was enough to be converted into enriched uranium sufficient for building one bomb (reported by Agence France Presse). But that view was not shared by United States Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, who said on an interview on the NBC news show, Meet the Press, ""I think that there has been a continuing focus on how do you get the Iranians to walk away from a nuclear weapons program? They're not close to a stockpile. They're not close to a weapon at this point.""Amidst the rising tide of anxiety over Iran's nuclear ambitions, there were questions of how Israel -- a sworn enemy of Iran -- would respond. According to a report published by the Daily Telegraph of London, Israel has launched covert operations against Iran, which include plans to assassinate nuclear scientists.

Drawing upon both United States and other Western intelligence sources, the report in the Daily Telegraph of London noted that Israel was using ""hit men,"" ""double agents"" and ""front companies,"" in targeted efforts to sabotage Iran's nuclear program by eliminating ""key human assets."" The report made mention of the death of an Iranian scientist at the Isfahan uranium plant. It reported of rumors linking the Israeli intelligence agency, Mossad, with the gas poisoning death of Ardeshire Hassanpour in 2007.

Making good on a campaign promise, United States President Barack Obama offered the possibility of diplomatic engagement with Iran. In a videotaped message in the third week of March 2009, President Obama said, ""My administration is now committed to diplomacy that addresses the full range of issues before us.""

President Obama made a point of using the official name of the country when he said that he wanted ""to speak directly to the people and leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran."" President Obama also indicated that his administration was committed ""to pursuing constructive ties among the United States, Iran and the international community.""

President Obama's message was broadcast at the same time as the Iranian festival of Nowruz. The timing may have been orchestrated for its symbolic value since Nowruz is a significant celebration on the Iranian calendar marking the start of spring. Making clear that a new era of diplomacy was ahead, President Obama said, ""With the coming of a new season, we're reminded of this precious humanity that we all share. And we can once again call upon this spirit as we seek the promise of a new beginning.""

But President Obama also struck a warning when he noted, ""This process will not be advanced by threats. We seek instead engagement that is honest and grounded in mutual respect."" He continued, ""The United States wants the Islamic Republic of Iran to take its rightful place in the community of nations. You have that right - but it comes with real responsibilities.""

In response, an advisor to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad cautiously welcomed the United States President Obama's message but called for a fundamental shift in American foreign policy. Of particular concern to Iran was the United States' support for Israel, according to Ahmadinejad's advisor, Ali Akbar Javafekr, who also said that the sanctions against Iran had to end. He continued, ""By fundamentally changing its behavior, America can offer us a friendly hand."" Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued a less diplomatic reaction, instead demanding that the United States radically change its policies.

Tense relations between the Washington D.C. and Tehran have been ongoing for decades but took a particularly negative turn when President Obama's predecessor, George W. Bush, referred to Iran as part of the ""axis of evil."" Bilateral relations devolved further when Iran decided to pursue its controversial nuclear program.

To date, the United States and many other countries have expressed anxieties about Iran's nuclear ambitions, which the Iranian government has maintained is for peaceful purposes and not intended to build atomic weaponry. The United States, first under the Bush administration, and now under the Obama administration, wants Iran to abandon its nuclear enrichment activities. That said, analysts surmise that in advancing this overture, President Obama has signaled interest in building a more constructive relationship with Tehran before directly confronting the nuclear issue.

Indeed, Javier Solana, the foreign policy chief of the European Union, characterized Obama's overture as ""very constructive"" and called on Iran to heed the United States' president's core message.In April 2009, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad presided over the opening of the country's first nuclear fuel production facility at Isfahan. He also announced that the new facility could produce pellets of uranium oxide, which could potentially fuel a heavy-water reactor being constructed in Arak. Such an ability would suggest that Iran has made great strides in its nuclear development program. Indeed, at full capacity, the new facility could produce enough plutonium to produce two nuclear weapons a year, assuming the plutonium was separated from the nuclear reactor's spent fuel.

Meanwhile, the Iranian leader said his country had tested two new types of centrifuge with higher capacities at a uranium enrichment plant in Natanz. Gholam Reza Aghazadeh, the head of Iran's nuclear program, said the country had increased the number of centrifuges it was running to 7,000. This claim has yet to be verified since international inspectors had earlier noted that Iran had less than 4,000 functioning centrifuges.

Iran's nuclear program has been a source of controversy, with many Western powers accusing Iran of using its nuclear power program as a veil for ambitions to build a nuclear arsenal. For its part, however, Iran has insisted that its nuclear development program is for peaceful purposes. But in a speech given at the opening of the nuclear production facility, President Ahmadinejad went further in explaining Iran's nuclear ambitions by noting that Iran was moving ahead with its nuclear agenda because it was the only way to establish Iran's status on the world stage. Stated differently, he was emphasizing a national identity interest.

President Ahmadinejad also responded to an offer of dialogue with six world powers when he said that his country was open to the notion. That being said, the Iranian leader said that such talks would only be in the offing in the context of ""justice"" and respect."" He said, ""The Iranian nation has from the beginning been after logic and negotiations, but negotiations based on justice and complete respect for rights and regulations."" He continued, ""One-sided negotiations, conditional negotiations, negotiations in an atmosphere of threat are not something that any free person would accept.""

But Russia and China -- two countries who have urged restraint by the West in dealing with Iran, have urged the Iranian authorities to accept the invitation. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Iran had to ""convince us all of the exclusively peaceful character of its nuclear program."" The five permanent United Nations Security Council members and Germany also urged Iran to accept the invitation to participate in talks. In a statement, they called on Iran ""to take advantage of this opportunity to engage seriously with all of us in a spirit of mutual respect."" United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton indicated that the United States wanted to be a full participant in such talks, saying, ""Obviously we believe that pursuing very careful engagement on a range of issues that affect our interests and the interests of the world with Iran makes senses."" The United States' top diplomat also emphasized the imperative of the effort noting, ""There is nothing more important than trying to convince Iran to cease its efforts to obtain a nuclear weapon."" China applauded the United States' engagement on the matter. Jiang Yu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said that Beijing was ""glad to see an improvement in relations between the United States and Iran."" President Ahmadinejad  responded to an offer of dialogue with six world powers when he said that his country was open to the notion.  Perhaps in an effort to provide the  reassurance sought by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov (as noted above), President Ahmadinejad says Iran has prepared proposals aimed at resolving his country's nuclear dispute with the West.The Iranian leader said that his country's proposal package would ensure ""peace and justice"" for the world although he offered no details.  On national television, Ahmadinejad said, ""We have prepared a package that can be the basis to resolve Iran's nuclear problem. It will be offered to the West soon.""He went on to describe his proposal by saying, ""It respects rights of all nations.""  Analysts, however, warned that what may be viewed in Tehran as an overture of peace and resolution may not find the same resonance in the capitals of the West. Iran tested the patience of the Western community by test firing a medium range surface-to-surface missile during the third week of May 2009. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad hailed the successful missile launch, saying that the Sajjil-2 missile utilized ""advanced technology"" and had demonstrated accuracy by landing on its unspecified target. Separate reports from the United States confirmed that the missile launch had indeed taken place successfully.

The missile, whose solid fuel capacity is believed to increase accuracy, could potentually reach Israel as well as American bases in the region. As well, it could theoretically be used to deliver nuclear warheads. Accordingly, there was a growing sense of concern about an apparently provocative act by Tehran at a time when Western powers were looking for productive dialogue, aimed at resolving the ongoing dispute over Iran's nuclear ambitions.

But in another twist, however, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad signaled that he was open to meeting with United States President Barack Obama, if he was successful in his re-election bid in June 2009.  Ahmadinejad said he was open to debating international issues with  the American president at a forthcoming United Nations session scheduled for September 2009.  He noted that he would only be willing to discuss Iran's nuclear program within the context of International Atomic Energy Agency regulations.  For his part, President Obama maintained his openness to constructive engagement with Iran.In September 2009, the issue of Iran's controversial nuclear program came to the fore.  A report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) noted that Iran's Natanz nuclear plant registered a reduction in the number of centrifuges used to actively enrich uranium.  Nonetheless, the IAEA also charged that Iran was not cooperating in an investigation of allegations that Iran was on the path toward weaponization of uranium.

To that end, the United States envoy to the IAEA, Glyn Davies, asserted that Iran was continuing to enrich uranium in defiance of the United Nations Security Council and could already have garnered sufficient enriched uranium to eventually produce a nuclear bomb.  At a meeting of the IAEA in Vienna, Davies said, ""We have serious concerns that Iran is deliberately attempting, at a minimum, to preserve a nuclear weapons option.""

In response, Iran's envoy to the IAEA, Ali Asghar Soltanieh, argued that there had been false accusations about Iran's nuclear program  from the United States before.  He said, ""The world is observing curiously whether or not this [American] administration follows the same trend as the Bush administration - pursuing hostile political confrontation, using fabricated baseless allegations.""  Iran has maintained that its nuclear program has only a purposes ad that its rocket building activities would be oriented toward satellites alone.

But analysts warned that Iran's vociferous defense of its nuclear program could be a strategy intended to stall further international action that might be in the offing. Indeed, United States President Barack Obama had,  by this point,  warned Iran that its friendly overtures toward engagement with Tehran would expire by the end of September 2009. At that time, the United States president was prepared to pursue new sanctions  against Iran.

Mohamed El Baradei, the head of the IAEA, urged Iran to accept the United States' offer of dialogue. Ahead of the IAEA meeting in Vienna, he said, ""The U.S. is making an offer without preconditions and on the basis of mutual respect."" He continued, ""The offer by the U.S. is an offer that should not be refused, that cannot be refused, because it has no conditions attached to it. And I hope [the] response will be positive.""Such hopes of dialogue were somewhat complicated after Iran put forth its package of proposals to the five  permanent United Nations Security Council members and Germany.  According to the independent United States-based entity, ProPublica, the five-page proposal, Iran called for  ""comprehensive, all-encompassing and constructive"" negotiations on a range of security issues, including global nuclear disarmament.  However, the document detailing Iran's latest proposals on its nuclear ambitions conspicuously failed to mention Iran's own nuclear program.

The United States reacted by registering dissatisfaction with the proposal package.  Philip Crowley, the United States Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs, said that the proposed mesaures failed to address the status of Iran's nuclear program.  He said, ""Our concern is that the response itself did not really address what is the core issue of the international community and the core concern, which is Iran's nuclear ambitions.""Conversely, Russia reacted by suggesting that the Iranian proposals signaled positive progress. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said, ""Based on a brief review of the Iranian papers my impression is there is something there to use.""  Lavrov also indicated that there would be no  oil sanctions against Iran. ""Some of the sanctions under discussion, including oil and oil products, are not a mechanism to force Iran to co-operate, they are a step to a full-blown blockade and I do not think they would be supported at the UN Security Council.""The American and Russian responses showed divergent approaches to the Iranian nuclear issue, and suggested that consensus on the matter would  not be easily achieved. The controversy surrounding Iran's nuclear program took on greater significance after the IAEA meeting, as discussed above.  If Russia was indicating that  it would not support strong oil sanctions against Iran, then what options would be available to countries such as the United States, which has made clear that consequences were in the offing if Iran failed to resolve the international community's concerns about its nuclear ambitions?

In mid-September 2009, experts at the United Nations nuclear monitoring agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), indicated their belief that Iran could have the ability to manufacture a nuclear bomb.  In a report drafted by IAEA officials, the report titled, ""Possible Military Dimension of Iran's Nuclear Program,"" also intimated that Iran could well be trying to develop a  missile system capable of carrying an atomic warhead.  The document was based on intelligence provided by internal IAEA investigations, external nuclear arms experts, as well as IAEA member states.  Excerpts of this confidential report was made public by the Associated Press.

Of particular concern in the document were the following three findings by the IAEA:

- Iran worked on the development of an internal chamber of a ballistic missile, which would have the capacity to house a warhead payload described as ""quite likely to be nuclear""

- Iran may have engaged in ""probable testing"" of explosives used to detonate a nuclear warhead; this method is referred to as ""full-scale hemispherical explosively driven shock system""

- Iran may have enough technical knowledge to enable the design and production of  an implosion nuclear device (i.e. an atomic bomb) ""using highly enriched uranium as the fission fuel""

Moreover, the document concluded that while Iran was not yet capable of attaching nuclear warheads to its Shahab-3 medium-range missile, further research and development could lead to the production of a prototype system.  To that end, the Shahab-3 missile -- with a range of up to 1,250 miles (2,000 kilometers) -- would place Israel within striking distance. Thusly, the IAEA has called on Iran to remove all doubts about its claim of an exclusively peaceful civilian nuclear energy program.

There was some hint that IAEA head, Mohamed ElBaradei, was not keen on sharing the substance of the report, which some IAEA member states have called a ""secret annex.""  For its part, the IAEA has referred to the notions of a ""secret annex"" on Iran as misinformation. With the report now in the public purview, the IAEA did not deny the existence of the document detailing Iran's nuclear record.  Instead, it released a statement noting that the IAEA had ""no concrete proof that there is or has been a nuclear weapon program in Iran.""  This position was similar to ElBaradei's statement in 2007 in which he maintained that there was no ""concrete evidence"" that Iran was carrying out atomic weapons work.

Nevertheless, in recent times, ElBaradei has moved away from his typically restrained tone in regard to Iran's nuclear program.  He has forthrightly encouraged Iran to cooperate with IAEA investigations and has urged dialogue sought by the United States.  Perhaps more importantly, in a private meeting with IAEA board members, ElBaradei reportedly said that if the intelligence on Iran's alleged nuclear weapons experiments were true, then ""there is a high probability that nuclear weaponization activities have taken place - but I should underline 'if' three times.""

Earlier in 2009, the IAEA reported that Iran  had produced more than enough low-enriched or fuel-grade uranium for one nuclear weapon.  Clearly, it was plausible that  Iran's  enrichment capacities may have expanded since that time at the start of the year. Perhaps not surprisingly, that possibility -- in conjunction with this confidential report -- have fueled the prevailing anxieties of countries, such as the United States, Israel and France, who have  already expressed alarm over Iran's controversial nuclear program.  Indeed, despite Iran's enduring insistence that its nuclear development has been purely for civilian energy purposes, the United States has long argued that Iran's uranium enrichment program could not be simply understood in those terms.  Now, it would seem that the United States' allegations were being bolstered to some degree by the emerging intelligence, its actual accuracy notwithstanding.

On September 17, 2009, United States Defense Secretary Robert Gates expressed concern about Iran's apparent stalling tactic saying,  ""We are all concerned about Iran running out the clock on us on their nuclear program.""  He continued, ""And our view is there is still time for diplomacy and, I might say, sanctions to persuade the Iranians that their security will be diminished by going down the track of nuclear weapons.""

For its part, Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has continued to dismiss allegations that Iran has nuclear weapons ambitions.  In a speech broadcast on Iranian state television, Khamenei said, ""We fundamentally reject nuclear weapons and prohibit the production and the use of nuclear weapons.""  But he also took aim at the United States, describing the American government's claims of Iran's nuclear ambitions as being  ""false.""  He also accused the current Obama administration in the United States as hostile and anti-Iranian despite its seemingly friendly overtures of engagement.

In a separate interview with NBC, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said that his country had no need of nuclear weapons.  He noted, ""We don't need nuclear weapons.  Without such weapons, we are very much able to defend ourselves."" That said, Ahmadinejad insisted on Iran's right to pursue its own nuclear energy program.  He said, ""If you are talking about the enrichment of uranium for peaceful purposes, this will never be closed down here in Iran."" In this way, Ahmadinejad was making clear that Iran would not yield to pressure from the international community.

With the controversy surrounding the actual purpose of Iran's nuclear program still percolating, attention fixed on the fate of Israel -- a state Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has repeatedly stated should be ""wiped from the map.""  The aforementioned intelligence about the possibility of attaching a nuclear bomb to a ballistic missile capable of hitting Israel has only increased fears about regional stability.  Additionally, it certainly has posed existential questions for Israel. With no concurrence on international sanctions against Iran, what options could be deployed against Iran if it failed to satisfy global concerns about its nuclear ambitions?

Neither the United States nor Israel have ever actually foreclosed the possibility of targeted air strikes against Iran, which would be specifically aimed at preventing that country from obtaining a nuclear weapon.  Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin entered the fray, speaking against military action and  the imposition of new sanctions against Iran. Prime Minister Putin characterized any attack on Iran as ""very dangerous"" and warned that it would lead to ""an explosion of terrorism.""  That said, he also called on Iran to show ""restraint"" in its nuclear program and to be mindful of Israel's security concerns.  Prime Minister Putin said, ""This is a dangerous region and Iran should show responsibility, especially by taking into account Israel's concerns.""

On September 20, 2009, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said during an interview on CNN that Israel had no plans to attack Iran.  The Russian leader said that after talks with Israeli President Shimon Peres, he was assured that Israel had no such intent saying, ""My Israeli colleagues told me they were not planning to act in this way, and I trust them.""  President Medvedev, like his colleague, Prime Minister Putin, warned against military action.  He described the notion of strikes against Iran as  ""the worst thing that can be imagined,"" saying it would lead to a ""humanitarian disaster.""Two months later, though, there was a greater spirit of partnership between the United States and Russia on dealing with Iran. Notably,  United States President Obama's meeting with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit focused on nuclear disarmament and, particularly, on the crafting of a new treaty to replace the expiring 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START).  As United States-Russia sought cooperation on the matter of reducing nuclear proliferation, it was not surprising that Iran's controversial nuclear program also came to the fore.On this issue, President Obama pressed for more pressure on Iran to come to some resolution with the international community over its nuclear program, but warned that time was running out.  Referring to a compromise proposal on the table that would send low enriched uranium out of Iran for reprocessing, and thus, curtail that country's nuclear breakout capability,  President Obama said, ""Unfortunately, so far it appears Iran has been unable to say yes."" Also on the agenda was Iran's willingness to comply with inspections from the International Atomic Energy Agency, which were aimed at determining if Iran's nuclear program includes weaponization. President Medvedev addressed the current course of multilateral diplomacy saying, ""We are prepared to work further and I hope our joint work will reach a positive result. In case we fail, other options remain on the table."" Yet to be determined was whether or not ""other options"" included further sanctions against Iran.

Iran commenced five days of war  exercises spanning  230,000 square miles of territory.The central objective of these large-scale exercises was to practice thwarting potential aerial attacks on its nuclear facilities.  In an interview on Iranian state media, the head of Iran's air defense -- Brigadier General Ahmad Mighani -- explained that the war games were intended ""to display Iran's combat readiness and military potentials.""  In this way, Iran was extroverting an aggressive military stance in an effort to stave off strikes on its nuclear facilities.

Other Iranian officials warned of retaliation in response to any attempt by foreign entities to target its nuclear sites. To that end, Iran warned it would not hesitate to carry out a retaliatory missile strike on Tel Aviv if  its nuclear facilities were attacked by Israel. Mojhtaba Zolnoor, an aide to Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khomeini, issued the following statement: ""If the enemy attacks Iran, our missiles will strike Tel Aviv.""  In an interview with the Fars News Agency, Amir Ali Hajizadeh -- the commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards' air force wing -- offered his own warning to Israel as follows: ""Their [Israeli] F-15 and F-16 fighters will be trapped by our air defense forces and will be annihilated.""

It should be noted that such action by Israel -- or even the United States -- has never been foreclosed.  Indeed, both countries have reserved the right to launch targeted strikes against Iran's nuclear sites in order to crush Iran's nuclear proliferation capacity.

Meanwhile, Iran also failed to gain the goodwill of the main players in the global community when it rejected a prevailing proposal to transport some of its low enriched uranium outside its borders for processing into fuel rods for the Tehran Research Reactor.  The proposal (discussed above), which was brokered by the United Nations' nuclear watchdog entity, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), was intended to provide Iran with a means for its research reactor to produce medical isotopes, while also reducing Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium.  The evident benefit would be that Iran's uranium could no longer be enriched to the point that it could facilitate weaponization.Iran said that rather than comply with the IAEA compromise proposal, it was considering the purchase of enriched uranium instead.  In an interview with the Mehr News Agency, Kazem Jalali said: ""Purchase of uranium enriched to the level of 20 percent is the best option to supply the fuel needed for the Tehran reactor."" The spokesperson for the Majlis National Security and Foreign Policy Commission continued, ""Production of 20 percent enriched uranium inside Iran is another option on the table.""

Iran's rejection of the proposal that it had earlier embraced was a blow to the diplomatic process.  Consequently, a multilateral bloc composed of the United Nations Security Council's permanent members (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States) and Germany  called on Iran to  reconsider its position.  In fact, the United Nations Security Council urged Iran to work cooperatively on a resolution, given the fact that it had already approved three rounds of sanctions, should Iran continue its existing uranium enrichment activities.  As if to underscore this possible outcome, Russian President Dimitry Medvedev warned that Iran could face new sanctions if it failed to take quick action in assuaging global doubts and suspicions about its nuclear ambitions.

These recent actions by Iran -- its show of military force as well as the rejection of the IAEA compromise proposal -- came at a time when that country was faced with sharp pressure from the international community to prove its claim that its nuclear development program was oriented toward nuclear energy generation.  Despite Iran's insistence that its nuclear ambitions have had a peaceful purpose, its failure to comply with the IAEA compromise proposal, as well as the recent revelations about a clandestine nuclear facility at Qom in late September 2009, have only bolstered the United States' accusation that Iran seeks to build a nuclear bomb.

As of November 2009, Iran's nuclear facility at Qom was the central focus of the nuclear debate.  A report by the IAEA asserted  that  the underground nuclear enrichment facility was ""in an advanced state.""  While IAEA inspectors noted that no centrifuges were yet installed, they nonetheless confirmed that the Qom nuclear plant was designed to accommodate 3,000 centrifuges.  As aforementioned, this amount was sufficient for the production of one or two nuclear  weapons on an annual basis, yet insufficient to power a civilian nuclear reactor. These findings formalized the previous reports made in September 2009, however, the IAEA went further in noting that Iran's reluctance to disclose the existence of the Qom facility ""reduces the level of confidence in the absence of other nuclear facilities under construction, and gives rise to questions about whether there were any other nuclear facilities in Iran which had not been declared to the agency."" The IAEA Board of Governors was scheduled to meet on Nov. 26, 2009 to discuss these issues in the broader context of Iran's actions related to its controversial nuclear program.  Of central importance was Iran's rejection of a broad compromise agreement, which would theoretically allow Iran to continue nuclear development at the Tehran Research Reactor by transporting low enriched uranium outside its borders for processing, while simultaneously reducing Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium and curtailing nuclear breakout activity.  Analysts suggested that the IAEA  Board of Governors could very well conclude that Iran's clandestine Qom facility was constructed in violation of nuclear non-proliferation safeguards, effectively referring Iran to the United Nations Security Council, with serious consequences to follow. Such a move would likely trigger further Iranian defiance and would invariably contribute to the devolution of the diplomatic process.  Should Iran decide to reconsider the IAEA compromise proposal  for the Tehran Research Reactor, then it was possible that the anticipated referral of Iran to the United Nations Security Council could be offered in softer tone (i.e. without setting an absolute course towards sanctions). Meanwhile, in a move that could be viewed as a tactical maneuver, Russia  announced in November 2009 that a nuclear power plant that it developed in southern Iran would not be launched in 2009 as scheduled.  In an interview with BBC News, Russian Energy Minister Sergei Shmatko said, ""We expect serious results by the end of the year, but the launch itself will not take place. ""The engineers have to reach their findings."" While Russia offered technical explanations on the record for the delay, there was growing consensus that the protracted process was actually linked with ongoing  conflict over Iran's nuclear activities and ambitions. By late November 2009, the governing body of the IAEA passed a resolution condemning Iran for developing a clandestine uranium enrichment site at Qom.  The IAEA's governing body also demanded that Iran freeze its activities at Qom immediately. It was the first resolution to be passed against Iran in four year and had strong support from the vast majority of the board members.  Indeed, the resolution  passed by a 25-3 margin with six abstentions. The resolution gained crucial backing from China and Russia, who appeared to have been frustrated by Iran's intransigence on the nuclear development controversy and its refusal to assent to the aforementioned compromise proposal. Their support for the rebuke indicated possible -- albeit not guaranteed -- support for sanctions in the future.

British Prime Minister Gordon Brown warned that stiff sanctions were in the offing for Iran if it did not respond generatively to this rebuke from the international community.  Speaking from a Commonwealth summit in Trinidad and Tobago, he said, ""I believe the next stage will have to be sanctions if Iran does not respond to what is a very clear vote."" Russia's Foreign Ministry urged Iran to respond to this development ""with full seriousness"" to the resolution. Striking a similar tone, the White House in the United States warned that Iran would have to address ""the growing international deficit of confidence in its intentions.""

But rather that taking a moderating position to these developments, Iran's reaction was one of defiance instead.  Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Ramin Mehmanparast characterized the IAEA vote as ""a theatrical move aimed at pressuring Iran,"" which he promised would be  ""useless"", according to the IRNA state news agency.  Then, Iran threatened to reduce its cooperation with the IAEA, stopping just short of breaking ties completely.  Intensifying the stakes, Iran's government additionally announced that it intended to build 10 new uranium enrichment sites. These three moves were contrary to the desired response sought by the international community and made clear that negotiations on Iran's nuclear program had reached a stalemate.

Underscoring that stalemate, the head of the IAEA, Mohammed ElBaradei, noted that his inspectors had seen little cooperation from the Iranian authorities and, as such, the IAEA had made no progress in its attempts to verify the so-called peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear program. El Baradei also issued a rare and gloomy depiction of the negotiating landscape.  He said, ""It is now well over a year since the agency was last able to engage Iran in discussions about these outstanding issues. We have effectively reached a dead end, unless Iran engages fully with us.""

Editor's Note: The existence of Iran's nuclear facility at Qom is very likely a violation of international law. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), which dates back to 1968, has  189 signatories, including Iran. According to Article Three of the Treaty:  ""Each Non-nuclear-weapon State Party to the Treaty undertakes to accept safeguards... for the exclusive purpose of verification of the fulfillment of its obligations assumed under this Treaty with a view to preventing diversion of nuclear energy from peaceful uses to nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices. Procedures for the safeguards required by this Article shall be followed with respect to source or special fissionable material whether it is being produced, processed or used in any principal nuclear facility or is outside any such facility. The safeguards required by this Article shall be applied on all source or special fissionable material in all peaceful nuclear activities within the territory of such State, under its jurisdiction, or carried out under its control anywhere.""  Given this clearly set forth set of rules, Iran -- as a non-nuclear weapons state and party to the Treaty -- must comply with its safeguard agreements, which constitute the core of the agreement. Failure to declare activity related to enriching nuclear material would be an ostensible violation of the NPT. Additional Notes: On  Dec. 16, 2009, Iran said it had successfully test-fired an advanced variant of its Sajjil-2 ballistic missile.  If confirmed, this test would demonstrate an acceleration of Iran's missile development program, given the fact that the two-stage Sajjil-2 was powered by solid fuel, effectively affording it greater range and accuracy than the liquid-fueled Shehab-3 missiles typically used by Iran. The Sajjil-2 was also known to have a more advanced guidance system. It should be noted that Iran test-fired a Sajjil-1 missile  earlier, evoking similar fears about that country's intent and its advances related to the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles used to carry nuclear warheads.  For his part, Iran's Defense Minister Ahmad Vahid said that the test-firing exercise was intended to show Iran's deterrent capabilities.  Regardless, the missile test appeared to be a clear act of defiance against the West and Israel, which has become increasingly alarmed about Iran's nuclear ambitions.  The United States responded by saying that its Missile Defense Agency in the Pacific would  conduct a missile test of its own in January 2010. Special Report:  Iran's Nuclear Enrichment Program  Introduction  In mid-January 2010, attention was upon possible sanctions being placed on Iran in response to its intransigence over its controversial nuclear development program and its possible violations of international law in this regard.  There was a prevailing sanctions proposa being advanced by the United States, given the fact that the Middle Eastern country missed the Dec. 31, 2009, deadline to accept a compromise deal to transfer its low enriched uranium outside its terrain for processing into fuel rods with a purity of 20 percent.  Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki demanded that nuclear fuel be sold to Iran or swap nuclear fuel for Iran's low-enriched uranium.  He issued a one-month deadline of his own as well as an ultimatum as follows: ""Otherwise, Tehran will enrich uranium to a higher purity needed for the fuel. This is an ultimatum.""  Also at issue has been  the fact that Iran has not opened its clandestine uranium enrichment plant near Qom for international inspection.  Iran's Latest Moves --

In February 2010, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad called on his country's nuclear head, Dr. Ali Akbar Salehi, to intensify  uranium enrichment, in defiance of the international community.  The move was essentially a fulfillment of an earlier threat by Iran to enrich uranium at a higher purity level of 20 percent. At issue has been Iran's claim that it is entitled to carry out a civilian nuclear program, aimed at generating energy.  This claim has been disputed by several countries of the West, and Iran's case has been compromised by revelations of clandestine nuclear development facilities including the discovery of a secret nuclear facility at Qom. This move by Iran to intensify its uranium enrichment came after Iran rejected a compromise deal to transfer its low enriched uranium outside its terrain for processing into fuel rods and, instead, imposed an ultimatum of its own. Specifically, Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki warned that his country would enrich uranium at the higher purity level (20 percent) if the West did not meet its counter-demand that nuclear fuel be sold to Iran or nuclear fuel be swapped for Iran's low-enriched uranium.  Of significance has been the fact that civilian nuclear power requires uranium enriched to about only three percent, whereas weapons grade uranium has to be enriched to 90 percent.  Intensification beyond the three percent range has, therefore,  signaled alarm bells across the globe. 

Clearly, the situation marked a further deterioration of relations between Iran and the West, and prompted the British Foreign Office to issue a statement asserting:  ""This would be a deliberate breach of five UNSCRs [United Nations Security Council Resolutions].""  As well, the United States called for united global action in the face of a possible Iranian nuclear threat.  With sanctions in the offing, United States Defense Secretary Robert Gates said that while there was time for the proposed sanctions to work, the world would have to ""stand together.""  During a visit to Italy, Gates said, ""Pressures that are focused on the government of Iran, as opposed to the people of Iran, potentially have greater opportunity to achieve the objective.""

By February 11, 2010, Iranian President Ahmadinejad announced in the capital city of Tehran that his country had now enriched its first batch of uranium to 20 percent.  The declaration came during a celebration marking the 31st anniversary of the Islamic Revolution. President Ahmadinejad said that the ""first consignment of the 20 percent enriched uranium has been produced and handed over to the scientists.""  He continued, ""God willing, the work will continue until completely supplying the country's needs.""  The Iranian president appeared to issue a veiled warning to the international community by noting that while his country was capable of enriching uranium up to 80 percent -- the intensity level of weapons grade enrichment -- it would not move in that direction.  Left unstated was the possible corollary:  Iran would not yet move in that direction.

Meanwhile, according to the New York Times, Iranian officials claimed that the 20 percent uranium enrichment process occurred at the Natanz facility and in the presence of inspectors from the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).  However, the IAEA would not confirm these claims by Iran.  Indeed, a memorandum dispatched by IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano to member nation states noted that  when the inspectors arrived at the Natanz facility, they were informed that Iran had already commenced the procedure of feeding low-enriched uranium into centrifuges for enrichment.

Background on Sanctions --

As noted above, the attention of the world's leading powers has been upon possible sanctions against Iran since the start of 2010.  Sanctions would be imposed in response to its intransigence over its controversial nuclear development program and its possible violations of international law in this regard.  There was a prevailing sanctions proposal, given the fact that the Middle Eastern country missed the Dec. 31, 2009, deadline to accept the aforementioned compromise deal to transfer its low enriched uranium outside its terrain for processing into fuel rods.  Also at issue has been  the fact that Iran has not opened its secret uranium enrichment plant near Qom for international inspection.

Accordingly, five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council plus Germany met for several hours on Jan. 16, 2010, to discuss the matter.  The meeting, however, ended without a clear agreement.Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov explained that  the meeting was ""inconclusive in a sense that we didn't make any decisions right away,"" but he notably added that most of the discussions were focused on the ""second track"" - a reference to the path of sanctions.  Those sanctions were expected to be levied against the Iranian government, as well as the Revolutionary Guard Corps, which has seen increased influence within Iran in recent times. Robert Cooper, a senior European Union official who led the meeting, said:  ""We will continue to seek a negotiated solution but consideration of appropriate further measures has also begun.""

It should be noted that the new target of proposed sanctions -- Iran's Revolutionary Guard -- has emerged because of its growing significance as a power center within the country.  Analysts have drawn  attention to the accelerating transfer of power to the Revolutionary Guard Corps, which was originally established in 1979 to protect the ideals of the Islamic revolution.  The political power and influence of the Revolutionary Guard was on full display in the anti-government protests that have occurred in Iran following its 2009 contested presidential election, making clear that they have become more closely intertwined with the base of clerical power surrounding Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khameini.  Moreover, the Revolutionary Guard was believed to be the leading entity behind Iran's  nuclear ambitions.In addition to its political power and influence has been the fact that the Revolutionary Guard has also become a powerful economic force in Iran.  It controls construction and even companies, earning  billions in public contracts over a two-year span, as reported by the Washington Post.  In that report, the Washington Post quoted Mashallah Shamsolvaezin of the Center for Scientific Research and Middle East Strategic Studies in Tehran, who said:  ""They [the Revolutionary Guard Corps] have become the main, most faithful caste, to protect the system of Islamic government. In exchange, wealth, power and respect are being transferred to them at an increasing rate.""

United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has reportedly been discussing a sanctions proposal with allied nations aimed at placing pressure on the Iranian regime and the Revolutionary Guard. Indeed, Secretary Clinton emphasized the inclusion of the Revolutionary Guard in this proposal saying, ""We have already begun discussions with our partners and with like-minded nations about pressure and sanctions.  Our goal is to pressure the Iranian government, particularly the Revolutionary Guard elements, without contributing to the suffering of the ordinary people, who deserve better than what they currently are receiving.""

But certain voices have argued that such sanctions will do little to stem the tide of power emanating from this enclave.  Indeed, Iranian parliamentarian Kazem Jalali said, ""U.S. sanctions will have no negative effect since the Guard organization is self-sufficient.""

Latest Developments --

On February 10, 2010, the United States Treasury Department levied specific sanctions against Iranian Revolutionary Guard by  freezing the assets of one individual -- General Rostam Qasemi -- as well as four companies affiliated with the Corps. Qasemi was the head of the engineering arm of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, known as Khatam al-Anbiya Construction.  As noted by Stuart Levey, the  United States Treasury's Under-Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, the Revolutionary Guard ""is hiding behind companies like Khatam al-Anbiya and its affiliates to maintain vital ties to the outside world.""  Clearly, this move by the United States Treasury was just one indication of the types of actions that might be levied against Iran in the near future.

Indeed, United States President  Barack Obama noted that his administration would develop ""a significant regime of sanctions"" over the next several weeks (February 2010) targeting Iran. Striking a much different tone from his earlier conciliatory intonation in regard to Iran, President Obama expressed confidence that the international community would coalesce efforts against that country.  He said, ""The international community is unified around Iran's misbehavior,"" and suggested that global powers would work together to apply pressure on Iran.In particular, President Obama acknowledged the new stance being taken by Russia, which has previously been reticent about applying sanctions to Iran.  Indeed, the United States president said that he was pleased to see ""how forward-leaning the Russians have been on this issue.""

Bolstering this position was a statement by Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov  in the aftermath of Iran's announcement that it was enriching uranium at higher levels.  Ryabkov explained in an interview with Interfax that sanctions against Iran were now more likely saying, ""In this new situation, the question of sanctions, of drafting a resolution for new sanctions has become more relevant."" Russia seemed to yet maintain its hope for dialogue  and diplomacy with Ryabkov remarking, ""However the situation may develop, a platform must remain for talks and ways must be sought to mitigate international concerns about Iran's nuclear program by involving Iran in diplomatic efforts.""

Regardless of Russia's evolving position in regard to tough sanctions against Iran, China -- which wields veto power at the United Nations Security Council -- was still maintaining its negative resolve against such action.

For its part, Iran has been telegraphing contradictory signals in what could only be described as mixed messages.  Even as Iran rejected the compromise deal discussed above, followed by Iranian President Ahmadinejad's announcement of uranium enrichment at higher intensity levels, Iran was still signaling its interest in engagement with the West.  Indeed,  Ali-Akbar Salehi, the director of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, said that  his country was still open to discussions the possibility of sending Iranian uranium abroad for enrichment.  Specifically, Iran's nuclear energy chief said in an interview with Iranian state television that Tehran was open to exchanging its 3.5 percent enriched uranium for 20 percent enriched nuclear fuel.  Salehi said, ""If they [re: the global powers] come forward and supply the fuel, then we will stop the 20 percent enrichment."" He explained that the Tehran Research Reactor required 20 percent enriched uranium to produce medical radioisotopes, necessitating the imperative that the nuclear reactor not exhaust its supply of fuel.  Salehi continued, ""All we have asked the West or countries that have the capacity to produce the fuel is 'Please supply us with the fuel.' So the deal is still on the table.""

Whether or not the global powers were actually interested in entertaining this complicated positioning by Iran was yet to be seen.  Certainly the United States was not wasting any time in trying to shore up support for its plans for Iran.  To those ends, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was traveling to the Middle East to seek support from Arab countries for harsher sanctions against Iran.  The keystone of the United States' diplomatic offensive was a speech by Secretary Clinton at the United States-Islamic World Forum, which was being hosted by the Washington-based Brookings Institute and the government of Qatar.  The speech was being billed as a sequel to President Barack Obama's historic address in Cairo, in which he called for the cessation of ""the cycle of mistrust and discord"" between the United States and the Muslim world.  At the forum in Qatar, Secretary Clinton urged Iran to reconsider its nuclear program and what she described as  ""dangerous policy decisions.""

Also central to Secretary Clinton's diplomatic offensive was dialogue with Saudi Arabia.  At issue was Saudi Arabia's flourishing trading relationship with China, and the concomitant belief that Riyadh could entice Beijing into abandoning its opposition to the plan for harsh sanctions against Iran.Assistant Secretary of State Jeffrey Feldman explained this maneuver as follows: ""We would expect [the Saudis] to use their relationships [with China] in ways that can help increase the pressure that Iran would feel.""  Perhaps partially driving China's continued reticence against sanctions has been  a possible loss of revenue from investments in Iran and a disruption in oil supplies from that country.  Accordingly, Saudi Arabia could play a vital role in reassuring China that it could neutralize any disruptions emanating from Iran. Iranian Nuclear Summit In mid-April 2010, Iran convened a nuclear disarmament conference in the capital city of Tehran.  There, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei charged that ""Only the U.S. government has committed an atomic crime.""  He continued, ""The world's only atomic criminal lies and presents itself as being against nuclear weapons proliferation, while it has not taken any serious measures in this regard."" This assertion from the Iranian leadership appeared to have been driven, at least in part, by the newly-reviewed United States nuclear posture, and came after the United States and Russia forged an agreement to decrease their respective nuclear arsenals.  In an apparent bid to show that his country did not intend on using nuclear weapons -- its acquisition notwithstanding -- Khamenei also said that the use of nuclear weapons was prohibited by religion. Emphasizing his moral objection to the use of nuclear weaponry, Khamenei characterized the potential deployment of a nuclear weapon as ""haram""  -- a prohibition under Islam. At the conference, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad called for an independent body to oversee nuclear disarmament.  Presumably, Ahmadinejad did not view the existence of the nuclear watchdog agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), as such an institution, despite its expressed purpose.  However, he did call for United States and other countries in possession of nuclear weapons to be suspended from the IAEA.  Iran also demanded that Israel, which is believed to possess an undeclared nuclear weapons program, to join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, as a means of assuring a nuclear weapons-free Middle East. For its part, Israel made it clear that it viewed Iran as the main security threat, not just to the region, but to the whole globe.  Speaking at a war memorial ceremony, Israeli  President Shimon Peres declared that Iran was a threat to the entire civilized world.  Further Nuclear Moves  On April 19, 2010,  Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  approved  the construction of a new nuclear enrichment plant.A senior adviser to the president, Mojtaba Samareh Hashemi, said: ""The construction process of the new site will begin upon the president's order.""  The announcement came two months after Iran said that it commenced enrichment of  low-level uranium for a research reactor in Tehran.  At that time, Iran said that it intended to begin construction on at least two new enrichment facilities.  Hashemi also said that while Iran remained open to negotiations on the concept of  a nuclear fuel swap ( a reference to a proposed plan to send most of its uranium abroad for processing and conversion into fuel rods for use in the research reactor), it would  not stop producing its own fuel in the interim. Accordingly, many Western countries have observed that Iran's actions are consistent with that of a country determined to produce nuclear weapons, it claims to the contrary, and its declarations of the immorality of the use of atomic weaponry notwithstanding.  In May 2010, as Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan traveled to Tehran for negotiations on Iran's controversial nuclear program in that country, there were suggestions from Ankara that a compromise deal was at hand.  The Turkish leader, along with Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, were playing key roles in trying to persuade Iran's government to agree to a deal that would transport its nuclear material abroad for processing. There were hopes that the two countries, which have enjoyed relatively friendlier diplomatic terms with Iran than the Western powers and Russia, might be positioned to successfully make the case for compromise.

This plan has seen several iterations over recent times, including provisions for the transfer of stockpiles of low enriched uranium to Russia and France for processing. It should be noted that until this time, the proposal has never garnered Iranian concurrence. In this new arrangement, the low enriched uranium would be transferred to Turkey.  With Iran already trying to avert the prospect of new sanctions being imposed by the United Nations, it was possible that there would be greater receptivity to the resurrected compromise deal, albeit with a more neutral country as the partner state.  There were hoped that such a proposition would  allay the West's fears that Iran's nuclear ambitions include nuclear weapons proliferation.  These anxieties  have only been strengthened by revelations about secret nuclear facilities in Iran, and non-compliance with monitoring regulations set forth by the International Atomic Energy Agency.   

However, the United States dismissed the deal brokered by Turkey, and drafted its own proposal to levy new sactions against Iran. That United States-drafted proposal was tabled at the United Nations Security Council, prompting Turkey to call for a delay in the interests of further negotiations.Such a delay was unlikely, as United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that the strong draft proposal against Iran was already backed  by the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. For his part, United States President Barack Obama made it clear that his country intended to pursue the new sanctions against Iran, irrespective of the new nuclear deal with Turkey and Brazil.  President Obama reportedly informed Turkish Prime Minister during a phone call that the new agreement  failed to build ""necessary confidence"" that Iran would abide by its international obligations.  Further, the United States leader acknowledged Turkey's and Brazil;s efforts, but noted that the new deal left open a host of ""fundamental concerns"" about Iran's atomic ambitions and broader nuclear program..

From Tehran,  the head of Iran's atomic energy organisation, Ali Akbar Salehi, dismissed the prospect of looming sanctions and predicted that such a move by the international community would ultimately backfire.  Salehi said, ""They won't prevail and by pursuing the passing of a new resolution they are discrediting themselves in public opinion.""  Nevertheless, the draft resolution on sanctions against Iran was reported to be already circulating in the chambers of the United Nations Security Council.United Nations Security Council votes to impose harsh sanctions against Iran over its nuclear program

On June 9, 2010, the United Nations Security Council voted in favor of fresh sanctions to be imposed on Iran over its failure to end its controversial nuclear program.  The vote in the United Nations Security Council was 12 in favor of the new round of sanctions, two against the sanctions, and one abstention.

The detailed vote count was as follows:

""Yes"" votes from permanent (i.e. with power of veto) United Nations Security Council members --United States, United Kingdom, France, Russia, China

""Yes"" votes from non-permanent (i.e. without power of veto) United Nations Security Council members --Japan, Austria, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Mexico, Nigeria, Gabon, Uganda

""No"" votes from non-permanent (i.e. without power of veto) United Nations Security Council members --Turkey, Brazil

""Abstention"" (from non-permanent member without power of veto --Lebanon

The sanctions would constitute the fourth round of such punitive actions against Iran, and was regarded as the harshest set of measures to date. The main provisions included an arms embargo, which would prohibit Iran from purchasing heavy weapons, such as attack helicopters and missiles;  stringent rules regarding financial transactions with Iranian banks;  and a wider swath of Iranian individuals and companies to be subject to travel bans and asset freezes. In addition, a new system of cargo inspections would be established to detect and stop Iran from acquiring banned materials.

The new sanctions regime was based on a draft prepared by the United States, which was tabled at the United Nations Security Council weeks prior. At the time, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that the strong draft proposal against Iran was already backed by the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. For his part, United States President Barack Obama made it clear that his country intended to pursue fresh sanctions against Iran, as a consequence of the prevailing ""fundamental concerns"" about Iran's atomic ambitions and broader nuclear program. Now, with the imposition of the new sanctions regime, President Obama heralded the measure as an unmistakable message to halting the spread of nuclear arms. The United States position was mirrored by the United Kingdom with Foreign Secretary William Hague saying that the vote in favor of fresh sanctions delivered a ""strong statement of international resolve,"" and would increase the pressure on Iran.

Despite Iran's insistence that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, its failure to comply with the standards imposed by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and the revelations about clandestine nuclear sites, have fueled anxieties by the international community that Iran does, in fact, intend to manufacture a nuclear bomb.  Indeed, China took a rare stand against Iran, emphasizing the imperative to deal with the threat of nuclear proliferation.  China's ambassador to the United Nations, Zhang Yesui, characterized the sanctions regime as an attempt to prevent nuclear proliferation in Iran.  The Chinese diplomat also noted that the new sanctions were targeted and would not hurt ""the normal life of the Iranian people.""

Meanwhile, backers of the new sanctions regime were denied a unanimous vote in its favor due to the ""no"" votes from Turkey and Brazil, who managed to cobble together a compromise deal with Iran weeks earlier on the transportation of low enriched uranium outside of Iran for processing.  That deal was regarded by the United States as not sufficiently strong to curb Iran's nuclear goals.  Indeed, as reportedly detailed in letters dispatched to the IAEA by Russia and France, the deal brokered by Turkey and Brazil would only cover 1,200 kilograms of low enriched uranium and would leave Iran with enormous stocks in their possession. For their parts, Turkey and Brazil took a different view, pointing to the concessions made by Iran in their own (now abandoned) compromise deal. Turkey and Brazil concluded that further sanctions against Iran would be counter-productive, hence their ""no"" votes.

Critics have argued that as strong as the new sanctions regime may be in comparison to measures of the past, it nonetheless falls short of the heavy pressure favored by hardliners. For example, there was no call for an oil embargo, and there were no crippling economic actions that could deleteriously affect Iran's vital interests. That being said, an even stronger sanctions regime was not likely to gain support from veto-wielding members of the United Nations Security Council, such as Russia and China. Moreover, while average Iranians were not likely to experience the effects of the new sanctions, the powerful Iranian Revolutionary Guard would not be so lucky.  Indeed, this was one of the expressed objectives set forth by the United States when it first began to consider the fourth round of sanctions against Iran.

The aim of a new sanctions regime was to specifically target the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, which has emerged as a power center within that country.  Analysts have drawn attention to the accelerating transfer of power to the Revolutionary Guard Corps, which was originally established in 1979 to protect the ideals of the Islamic revolution.  The political power and influence of the Revolutionary Guard was on full display in the deadly anti-government protests that occurred in Iran following its 2009 contested presidential election, making clear that they have become more closely intertwined with the base of clerical power surrounding Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khameini.  Moreover, the Revolutionary Guard was believed to be the leading entity behind Iran's nuclear ambitions.

In addition to its political power and influence has been the fact that the Revolutionary Guard has also become a powerful economic force in Iran.  It controls construction and even companies, earning billions in public contracts over a two-year span, as reported by the Washington Post.  In that report, the Washington Post quoted Mashallah Shamsolvaezin of the Center for Scientific Research and Middle East Strategic Studies in Tehran, who said:  ""They [the Revolutionary Guard Corps] have become the main, most faithful caste, to protect the system of Islamic government. In exchange, wealth, power and respect are being transferred to them at an increasing rate.""  Thus, the intrinsic value of targeting the new sanctions in such a way as to strike at the core of the Revolutionary Guard Corps.

From Tehran, the head of Iran's atomic energy organization, Ali Akbar Salehi, dismissed the prospect of looming sanctions and predicted that such a move by the international community would ultimately backfire. Salehi said, ""They won't prevail and by pursuing the passing of a new resolution they are discrediting themselves in public opinion."" Now, with the sanctions a reality and not a theoretical measure, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad adopted a dismissive tone. In an interview broadcast on Iran's ISNA news agency, he said: ""I gave one of the [world powers] a message that the resolutions you issue are like a used handkerchief, which should be thrown in the dustbin. They are not capable of hurting Iranians.""  Clearly, Iran was trying to deliver the message that it would not be intimidated by the international community's punitive actions.

That being said, in mid-June 2010, both the United States and the European Union announced their own unilateral sanctions to be imposed on Iran.  In the case of the United States, the new sanctions by the Treasury Department targeted Iran's nuclear and missile programs, by concentrating on the financial sector, the shipping industry and Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.  The new sanctions imposed by the European Union included a ban on investments and technology transfers to Iran's key oil and gas industry.  Russia responded by criticizing these separate sanctions efforts, despite its support for the new round of sanctions imposed by the United Nations, as discussed above.  In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Russian President Medvedev said, ""We didn't agree to this when we discussed the joint resolution at the United Nations.""Iran prevents IAEA inspectors from entering the country

On June 21, 2010, Iran informed by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that two of its inspectors would not be allowed to enter the country.Ali Akbar Salehi, the head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, explained that the action had been taken because the IAEA  had published a report his country deemed to be  ""untruthful"" in regards to Iran's nuclear activities.  Salehi said, ""If an inspector makes a report contrary to the standing fact... we have the right to place a protest as we did in regard to the report by two inspectors.""  Salehi did not specify exactly what portion of the IAEA report was regarded as inaccurate by Iran.  That being said, general consensus that the issue at the core of the controversy probably involved Iran's claim at the start of the year that its scientists had carried out pyroprocessing experiments -- a process which potentially used to purify uranium for use in nuclear weapons.  The IAEA responded to the claim by requesting further information from Iran, but by March 2010, Iran was reversing its initial claims and saying that it never conducted such activities.  That scenario, clearly, left the IAEA somewhat suspicious of Iran's actual nuclear activities.  That suspicion was further stoked when in May 2010, IAEA inspectors visited the site of the claimed pyroprocessing experiments and found that an electrochemical cell had been ""removed,"" as disclosed in the IAEA report.Iran's provocative moves:On Aug. 22, 2010, Iran unveiled its newest addition to its military -- an unmanned bomber jet. While the Karrar drone was not expected to have a significant impact on the strategic balance of the Middle East, Iran's decision to procure the craft appeared to signify that country's desire to expand its conventional weapons capabilities. Not one to miss an opportunity to threaten geopolitical antagonists, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who was addressing the country's annual Defense Industry Day ceremonies, described the Karrar drone as a ""messenger of death for the enemies of humanity.""

Only days later, Iran remained in the international spotlight when it announced that it had successfully test-fired an upgraded version of a short-range surface-to-surface missile. The new version of the Fateh-110 missile, which translates into ""conqueror"" in Farsi, has been equipped with a guidance control system known for its accuracy. As well, its range has been increased as compared with earlier versions. According to Iranian Defense Minister Ahmad Vahidi, the solid-fuel Fateh-110 missile was developed domestically by Iran's Aerospace Industries Organization and held the potential of striking targets up to 120 miles away. On Iranian state television, Vahidi said, ""Employing a highly accurate guidance and control system has enabled the missile to hit its targets with great precision."" The upgraded missile was to be transferred to the possession of the Iranian military by September 2010.

While a short-range surface-to-surface missile was not evidence of a nuclear threat, it nonetheless recalled a report issued a year earlier by experts at the United Nations nuclear monitoring agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which indicated their belief that Iran could have the ability to manufacture a nuclear bomb. In that report titled, ""Possible Military Dimension of Iran's Nuclear Program,"" experts intimated that Iran could well be trying to develop a missile system capable of carrying an atomic warhead.  That document concluded that while Iran was not yet capable of attaching nuclear warheads to its Shahab-3 medium-range missile, further research and development could lead to the production of a prototype system. To that end, the Shahab-3 missile -- with a range of up to 1,250 miles (2,000 kilometers) -- would place Israel within striking distance. Clearly, the upgraded Fateh-110 would not have comparable range; however, it was clear that Iran was intent on publicizing its growing military weapons capacity to the outside world. This was the case in September 2009 when Iran test-fired two short-range missiles -- the Tondar-69 and the earlier incarnation of the Fateh-110 -- followed by the long-range Shahab-3 ballistic missile and the surface-to-surface Sajjil.  Once again, these unambiguous acts of defiance by Iran in 2010 were sure to raise the ire of the West.

Meanwhile, around the same period (August 2010), Iran announced it would commence building a new uranium enrichment plant in early 2011. The new facility would be only one of 10 new uranium enrichment facilities planned for construction in Iran. Ali Akbar Salehi, the head of Iran's nuclear program, said in an interview with Iranian state television that ""studies on finding locations for the construction of 10 new sites are going through their final stages."" He also confirmed that construction would commence on one of these sites ""by the end of the current Iranian year (in March 2011), or shortly afterwards.""

These moves have been part of Iran's insistence on pursuing a nuclear program in defiance of Western powers, who have accused Iran of having a nuclear weapons proliferation agenda. While Iran has denied these ambitions and insisted on a program for peaceful purposes, it has nonetheless violated international regulations by constructing a clandestine enrichment plant at Qom. The construction of the secret enrichment plan in Qom -- revealed in 2009 -- was in violation of the safeguard provisions set forth in the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), and effectively fueled global anxieties about Iran's true intent. In response, the United Nations, as well as the United States and European Union, have imposed sanctions against Iran in an effort to suppress that country's nuclear ambitions.

On Aug. 20, 2010, Iran launched its first nuclear reactor at the Bushehr nuclear power station in the southern part of the country. The plant, which took 35 years to construct due to a series of delays, was to be operated by Russia. Indeed, Russia was to be responsible for supplying nuclear fuel and removing the nuclear waste. Due to Russian involvement in the project, the opening ceremony of the Bushehr nuclear power station was witnessed by Iranian and Russian officials.

The Iranian government hailed the development as a victory over its enemies. However, because the power plan has taken more than three decades to construct, it was an older model with limited contribution to the national grid. As a result, despite the celebration surrounding the opening of the plant, which would begin producing electricity in four weeks from the launch date, the significance of the Bushehr power station was regarded as more symbolic than substantive. Moreover, the real issue within the international community has not been a matter of nuclear energy production, but fears that Iran seeks to build a nuclear weapon. Accordingly, Iran has been the target of four rounds of United Nations sanctions due to its uranium enrichment program, which was quite separate from this nuclear reactor project. That is to say, whereas the Bushehr nuclear power plant used uranium enriched by 3.5 percent, weapons-grade uranium must be enriched by more than 90 percent. Throughout, it has been Iran's uranium enrichment activities at levels higher than three percent that have sparked alarm bells across the West.

Nevertheless, as before, Iran appeared intent on defying the international community with the head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, Ali Akbar Salehi, saying that his country would continue uranium enrichment. To that end, a serious concern for the international community has been a pilot program to enrich uranium to 20 percent, which Iran contends is necessary for a medical research reactor. Clearly, this higher level of uranium enrichment has been a concern for Western powers more than Bushehr nuclear power station, sparking fears in Israel, which has a particularly hostile relationship with Iran and has suggested the notion of targeted military strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities.Israel's options in dealing with Iran's nuclear program --

With  Iran's nuclear moves dominating the geopolitical landscape, there was increasing speculation about Israel's own alternative options.  Indeed, the one country in the Middle East most likely to feel threatened by a nuclearized Iran was Israel, given the clear antipathy expressed by the Iranian regime against the Jewish state of Israel.  Speculation has abounded that Israel has been contemplating military strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities, not unlike the 1981 air strike Israel reportedly carried out against Saddam Hussein's nuclear reactor in Osiraq. That scenario has frequently been touted as a model of preventative military strikes to be used against looming nuclear threats.

But the landscape in 2010 was quite different from the situation almost three decades ago. Notably, in 1981, even though Iraq and Iran were embroiled in a war, Israeli F-16 jet fighters encountered little resistance as they carried out their mission. While there was limited anti-aircraft fire, there were no air patrols of surface-to-air missiles to contend with. Clearly, three decades later, Israel was not likely to have such an easy field of action in Iran.

Then there has been the matter of whether Israel can achieve the same objective in 2010 as it did in 1981. Almost three decades ago, Israel was able to land such a blow on Iraq's nuclear facility that Saddam Hussein's regime was never able to build nuclear weapons. As of 2010, there was no such confidence that Iran's nuclear breakout capabilities would be curtailed in similar strikes. Of significant consideration has been the fact that Iran's multiple nuclear sites are dispersed with some in remote areas and others underground. The revelation about the clandestine Qom facility only bolsters the belief that there may be other such nuclear facilities across Iran. Indeed, Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak acknowledged during a parliamentary meeting that facilities such as the Qom site ""cannot be destroyed through a conventional attack."" Accordingly, there is no guarantee that air strikes could do more than setback Iran's nuclear ambitions a year or two.

Nevertheless, there were clear signs that the military option remained on the table, given the Netanyahu government's decisions to increase the defense budget, distribute gas masks to all citizens, and simulate a biological attack. But there were also signals of Israel's awareness that the military options may not yield optimal results. Accordingly, Israel has shown support for the notion of sanctions against Iran, although its call for crippling sanctions may not coincide with the new impetus by the international community for targeting the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps in its sanctions. The international community, including the Obama administration in the United States, has not been keen to punish the Iranian people for the regime's ills, and has had to balance reticent powers, such as Russia and China, to even entertain the notion of sanctions. Thusly, targeted sanctions against the Revolutionary Guard and clerical elite have gained support. But Israel believes that only crippling, broad-based sanctions will have a sufficiently strong effect to stoke internal fissures, and possibly spur the collapse of the clerical regime.

By August 2010, around the same period that Iran launched a nuclear reactor at Bushehr and announced its plans to start building new uranium enrichment plant in 2011, the government of the United States reportedly tried to assuage Israel on the nuclear threat posed by Iran. According to a report by the New York Times, the Obama administration conveyed evidence to Israeli counterparts showing that problems within Iran's nuclear program meant that it would take at least a year for that country to actually build a nuclear weapon. That timeline, it was believed, would decrease the possibility that Israel would soon carry out a pre-emptive strike against Iran's nuclear facilities.

""Soon,"" though, has been a relative consideration. According to Jeffrey Goldberg of the Atlantic Monthly, Israel was biding its time to see if the non-military options could yield positive results; however, it was nevertheless prepared to carry out unilateral strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities. To that end, Goldberg contended that, at this time, it was Israel's belief that strikes against Iran's nuclear sites could halt progress on that country's nuclear development program for several years. That is to say, Israel now held the view that it could strike a blow at the nuclear breakout capability of Iran.

It should be noted that several strikes -- in the plural --would be needed to achieve such an end; among the likely targets would be the uranium-enrichment facility at Natanz, the formerly clandestine enrichment site at Qom, the nuclear-research center at Esfahan, and the Bushehr reactor.  Undoubtedly, flying multiple jet fighters through foreign air space would present Israel with a constituently complicated proposition.

The logistics of such a military operation by Israel notwithstanding, the cost of such an offensive endeavor might be determined to be too high. Certainly, the likely effects were forecast to be manifold ranging as they do from geopolitical chaos to economic turbulence due to a potentially drastic spike in the price of oil.  Iran and its allies could well retaliate by firing rockets at Israeli cities, which could effectively ignite a regional war.  As well, extremist terrorist enclaves in the region, such as Hezbollah and Hamas, would have an accentuated rallying cry. The result might be an even more imperiled Israel.

Yet the question of peril has been at the top of Israel's agenda, given the belief that Iran may gain the technological knowledge to construct nuclear bombs within a relatively short period of time. It may be Israel's calculation that potentially deleterious consequences are worth the effort, given the existential stakes for the Jewish nation state.  Those existential stakes were brought into high relief as a result of the vituperative threats uttered by Iran's leaders that Israel should be ""wiped off the map.""

Worth noting is the fact that a nuclearized Iran poses a threat not only to Israel but to other countries in the Middle East. Indeed, a nuclear-armed Iran would, itself, have a destabilizing effect across the Middle East, most obviously by potentially triggering a nuclear arms race in the region among other countries not willing to cede power to nuclearized Iran. But quite in contrast to the arms race of the Cold War, which actually functioned as a deterrent and managed to stabilize the international scene in some ""realpolitik"" sense, a modern arms race in a region known for suicide bombings could trigger catastrophic results.

For this reason, Israel may find some unlikely allies in its neighborhood in the form of certain powerful Arab countries, such as Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia, which is not keen on the notion of a nuclearized Shi'a-dominated Iran in their backyard. Israel may also find there is a geopolitical benefit to resolving the Palestinian issue, thereby minimizing its field of enemies.  But the very complexity of the Arab backyard may present yet another reason why Israel may decide that targeted strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities -- regardless of the risk -- are worth the effort. The smaller Arab states may be compelled to move from moderation and tacit pro-Western inclinations toward more hardline and pro-Iranian stances by virtue of the influence of a nuclearized Iran. That is to say, small Arab states may believe they have no choice but to throw their lot in with a nuclear Iran despite their past cooperation with the West. It was implausible that Israel -- and, indeed, the West -- would look positively on the prospect of a politically-strengthened and nuclearized Iran standing strong in the heart of the Middle East.

Update --With the prospect of strikes by Israel against Iran's nuclear facilities looming, on September 5, 2010, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad warned that any attack against his country would mean the end of the Jewish State of Israel. During  a visit to Qatar, Ahmadinejad said, ""Any offensive against Iran means the annihilation of the Zionist entity.""  Expressing his antipathy for Israel, he continued, ""Iran does not care much about this entity because it is on its way to decay."" Ahmadinejad also appeared to dismiss the notion of an attack by either Israel or the United States on Iranian nuclear facilities in the first place, saying that those two countries, ""know that Iran is ready and has the potential for a decisive and wide-scale response.""  But with an eye on shoring up support from smaller Arab countries that house United States military bases, Ahmadinejad said called for more cooperation between Muslim countries of the Middle East despite the sectarian schism between Shi'ites and Sunnis.On September 23, 2010, delegates from the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Costa Rica and 27 European Union countries walked out in protest during Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's address to the United Nations General Assembly.  At issue was the Iranian president's  statement that ""some segments within the U.S. government"" may have orchestrated the  September 11, 2001 terror attacks in the United States as part of an American conspiracy to protect Israel.

Mark Kornblau, a spokesman for the United States Mission to the United Nations issued a statement asserting that the Iranian president ""has yet again chosen to spout vile conspiracy theories and anti-Semitic slurs that are as abhorrent and delusional as they are predictable.""  The situation would not help efforts to bring Iran together with the six powers -- the United States, the United Kingdom, China, Russia, France and Germany -- for negotiations on the matter of Iran's controversial nuclear development program.  British  Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg  highlighted the pall cast on the hopes for renewed negotiations by Ahmadinejad's comments saying: ""An issue of grave global concern has been overshadowed by the bizarre, offensive and attention-grabbing pronouncements by President Ahmadinejad from this podium yesterday. His remarks were intended to distract attention from Iran's obligations and to generate media headlines. They deserve to do neither.""  Outside the United Nations compound in New York, thousands of demonstrators gathered to protest the presence of President Ahmadinejad there.

The controversy surrounding the multilateral walkout of Ahmadinejad's speech notwithstanding, the Iranian president hinted on September 24, 2010 that his country would consider ending uranium enrichment, if nuclear fuel could be sent to Tehran for a medical research reactor that produces medical isotopes for patients. He said, ""We will consider halting uranium enrichment whenever nuclear fuel is provided to us.""  Ahmadinejad explained that Iran had no need to enrich uranium at levels of three to 20 percent beyond medical research, but that his country was forced to do so out of necessity.  Indeed, such levels of enrichment, while still not as high as that needed for weapons-grade development, have nonetheless alarmed the West.  In an interview with the Associated Press, Ahmadinejad said, ""We were not interested to carry out 20 percent enrichment. They (the U.S. and its allies) politicized the issue. We were forced to do it to support the (medical) patients.""  President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad also said that Iran was interested in setting a date to re-open talks with the aforementioned six powers.  In this way, by the autumn  of 2010, Iran was indicating that it was ready to return to the negotiating table for discussions with world powers pertaining to that country's controversial nuclear program.

At issue has been Iran's insistence on pursuing a nuclear program in defiance of Western countries, who have accused Iran of having a nuclear weapons proliferation agenda. While Iran has denied these ambitions and insisted that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, it has nonetheless violated international regulations by constructing a clandestine enrichment plant at Qom. The construction of the secret enrichment plan in Qom -- revealed in 2009 -- was in violation of the safeguard provisions set forth in the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), and effectively fueled global anxieties about Iran's true intent. In response, the United Nations, as well as the United States and European Union, have imposed sanctions against Iran in an effort to suppress that country's nuclear ambitions.

Now, there seemed to be some multilateral efforts to see the nuclear talks resumed with Catherine Ashton, the security and foreign affairs chief of the European Union, suggesting that fresh negotiations be held in Vienna ""over three days in mid-November."" Such a meeting would presumably take place with the participation of the United States, Britain, China, France, Russia and Germany. This announcement came after a meeting between Ashton and United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in Belgium. Referring to Iran's main nuclear diplomat, Darren Ennis, a spokesperson for Ashton, said: ""Ashton hopes Mr. (Saeed) Jalili will respond positively and looks forward to constructively engaging with Iran next month."" For his part, Jalili was reported to have welcomed Ashton's overture during an interview on Iranian state television. Jalili reportedly said, ""We have always said talk for cooperation with Iran is the only suitable alternative for (the West).""

By  October 29, 2010, Iran said that it was prepared to participate in talks dealing with its controversial nuclear program. According to Ashton, a letter received from Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, Jalili, made clear that negotiations could resume at a date after November 10, 2010.  The announcement came at a time when the United States was reportedly forging a new fuel exchange deal (re: a proposed plan to send  Iran's uranium abroad for processing and conversion into fuel rods for use in the research reactor). Indeed, United States Department of State spokesman, P.J. Crowley reportedly confirmed the reports that his country, in collaboration with European allies, were working on a new nuclear exchange proposal for Iran.  A previous proposal, which was rejected by Iran, would have transported 2,650 pounds of uranium outside of Iran for enrichment; this new proposal would significantly increased the amount of uranium to be enriched externally ultimately for use in a medical research reactor.  Iran would also be asked to halt production of nuclear fuel at 20 percent enrichment levels; typically, higher enrichment levels denote weapons grade uranium and a cessation of nuclear fuel production at that level would indicate good faith toward Iran's claim that it has no nuclear weapons development agenda.

It was yet to be seen how Tehran would respond to these new conditions. Iran's willingness to return to the negotiating table could well suggest that the newest round of sanctions against Iran have had an effect on the country, effectively thrusting it into a position of flexibility. However, such presumed flexibility was not on display on Nov. 10, 2010 when Iranian President Ahmadinejad characterized his country's right to nuclear capabilities as non-negotiable. In a televised speech, he said, ""We have repeatedly said that our (nuclear) rights are not negotiable ... We only hold talks to resolve international problems ... to help the establishment of peace."" Diplomats from the European Union offered the most favorable interpretation of Ahmadinejad's statement, suggesting he was simply recapitulating Iran's expressed stance while not foreclosing negotiations on finding a resolution.

Around the same period, Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, Jalili, dispatched a letter to EU foreign affairs chief Ashton in which the dates November 23, 2010, and December 5, 2010, were mentioned in terms of scheduling the much-anticipated nuclear negotiations. With the November date passing, all eyes were on forthcoming nuclear negotiations to convene in December 2010. Meanwhile, on November 9, 2010, United States President Barack Obama renewed an existing freeze on Iranian government assets held in his country. That freeze has been in place since the Iran hostage crisis of 1979 and is subject to annual renewal.

By the start of December 2010, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  excoriated Iran for its non-compliance with international nuclear monitoring. The director of the IAEA, General Yukiya Amano, railed against Iran for failing to cooperate with IAEA inspectors.  He said, ""The agency needs Iran's cooperation in clarifying outstanding issues which give rise to concerns about possible military dimensions to its nuclear program."" This particular statement appeared to bolster Western fears that Iran does indeed possess nuclear weapons development ambitions, its protestations to the contrary notwithstanding. Indeed, areport released in February 2010 by the IAEA suggested that Iran was already working on the development of a nuclear-armed missile.

With the nuclear negotiations looming, on December 2, 2010, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany issued a joint statement that read as follows: ""There is no alternative: Iran must actively address the lack of confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear program.""  The statement noted that the aforementioned report on Iran's nuclear program by the IAEA ""paints a very disturbing picture"" of Tehran's actions.  The statement continued of the IAEA report, ""It again testifies that Iran continues down the path of non-compliance and confrontation.""  Accordingly, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany called on  Iran to move off the ""path of non-compliance and confrontation"" and, instead, act in a productive manner at the much-anticipated multilateral talks to be held in Geneva, Switzerland.

For its part, Iran agreed to meet with a representative of a six-party multilateral bloc [Catherine Ashton]  but emphasized that it would  not negotiate about its ""nuclear rights.""  The reference to ""nuclear rights"" has been regarded by Western powers as a  euphemism for Iran's nuclear weapons ambitions.  Indeed, Iran has been steadfast on its insistence that it should not have to limit or curb uranium enrichment.

Multilateral nuclear negotiations were scheduled to begin on December 6, 2010 in Geneva, Switzerland with Iran present to discuss its controversial nuclear program with the major powers -- the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia and China.All six countries would like to see Iran  suspend uranium enrichment in return for an incentives package.

To that end, the United Kingdom, France, Germany were hoping that the negotiations in Geneva would serve ""to engage Iran into a phased approach of confidence building which should lead to meaningful negotiations.""  The United States envoy to the IAEA, Ambassador Glyn Davies, struck a similar tone saying that his aspirations were for ""frank, constructive and meaningful"" negotiations with Iran.  He continued, ""We would like to arrive at an early negotiated resolution of international concerns with Iran's nuclear program."" Davies was also realistic about the difficulty of the goals at hand, noting, Iran nuclear program and uranium enrichment constituted ""a problem that will not go away absent meaningful and concrete steps by Iran.""

Perhaps indicating that the two sides were not viewing the agenda in quite the same way, Iran's ambassador to the IAEA, Ali Asghar Soltanieh, said that his country was ready for talks to resolve global and regional issues, described as ""conflicts of the whole world.""  But dealing with ""conflicts of the whole world"" was hardly  the stated goal of the nuclear negotiations and could indicate that Iran seeks to dilute the discussions at hand.

Another problem at hand has been Iran's skepticism about the intentions of the wider global community, manifest in a quasi-covert war against Iran.  Of concern for Iran have been the assassinations of two Iranian nuclear scientists, along with  the attempted murder of a third such professional. In addition, Iran's computer systems at the  Bushehr nuclear reactor was  subject to a computer virus, which was believed to have caused the temporary  shutdown of the Natanz centrifuges in November 2010.  In Iran, these incidences have been attributed to either Israel or the United States and was likely to fuel further intransigence by an infuriated Iran.

Such an end was not helped by the infamous ""Wikileaks"" revelations in which confidential government cables were publicized.  Of note was the  revelation that some Arab governments aligned with the United States actually encouraged the United States to  carry out targeted strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities.  While it would come as no surprise to find that Israel considers Iran's nuclear ambitions to be a threat, the revelation that Arab countries in the Middle East would find consensus with Israel on the matter of a nuclearized Iran could be seen as somewhat more surprising.  Nevertheless, as the Sunni-Shi'a schism escalates around the world, perhaps it is not so unlikely that Israel and Arab regimes might a shared anxiety about a nuclear-armed Iran in their collective backyard. The result of the ""Wikileaks"" revelations, though, was that smaller Arab countries in the Middle East might now seek to assuage infuriated Iran, effectively lessening the weight of global power against Iran's burgeoning nuclear program.

But another outcome of the ""Wikileaks"" revelations has been that the Obama administration in the United States expected its outreach to Iran to end in failure. The ""Wikileaks"" document deluge included evidence that the United States was quite prepared for Iran's intransigence and unwillingness to meet in the proverbial middle.  Clearly, that outreach to Iran was for the benefit of other world powers, in the hopes that by exerting all diplomatic avenues, countries such as France and Russia would be more amenable to the idea of harsh sanctions against Iran.  To that end, it would appear that the Obama administration was successful in applying the so-called ""carrot and stick"" approach to Iran's uranium enrichment activities, if its actual goal was the institution of a harsh sanctions regime.  But success in actually curtailing Iran's uraniumactivities was yet to be determined.  The talks set to commence in Geneva would be a step in the direction of progress, if the world powers are able to make progress on a fuel-swap deal for a Tehran medical research reactor.

On December 5, 2010 -- on the eve of the nuclear talks,  Iran announced that it had made strides in its efforts to produce raw uranium.  Iran said that it had not only produced raw or ""yellowcake"" uranium, but that it was ready for enrichment.  According to Iran's nuclear chief, Salehi, the batch of domestically-produced yellowcake uranium from the Gachin mine would be transferred to the Isfahan nuclear conversion facility, where it can be enriched.  Of course, enriched uranium at high levels is used for the production of nuclear bombs. By releasing this information ahead of the much-anticipated nuclear negotiations,  Iran to staking out a defiant position on the global landscape.  Clearly,  Iran wanted the world to know that they had access to raw uranium despite the general view that it was running low on such stocks.  In so doing, Iran was making to clear to the world that it was within its power to move forward with uranium enrichment.  Was this move intended to bolster Iran's negotiating power?  Or was it intended to provoke an international response? These are open questions yet to be determined as the wider global community closes ranks over the prospect of a nuclearized Iran. Note: At the close of the talks, Iran and the multilateral parties agreed to resume negotiations in January 2011 in the Turkish city of Istanbul. On January 8, 2011, the Wall Street Journal reported that Iran's weapons development capacity may have been curtailed by the more stringent sanctions regime championed by the West and imposed by the United Nations Security Council.  According to Israel's outgoing intelligence head, Meir Dagan,  Iran was unlikely to be able to build a nuclear weapon until 2015.  Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Moshe Yaalon was making a similar claim on Israeli Army Radio also that Iran was three years away from developing a nuclear warhead. This stance was quite a departure from an earlier timeline by Israel that suggested Iran was close to being able to build a bomb, thus raising speculation about a potential strike by Israel on nuclear targets in Iran. Now, Israel's position  appeared to be in line with the United States' claim that international sanctions have limited Iran from procuring materials needed for the building of a nuclear bomb.  Of course, the outgoing Dagan also pointed to ""covert activities"" as being an additional reason for the revised timeline.  In fact, officials across the world have noted that Iran's ability to deploy advanced centrifuge machines, which would be needed for the production of highly enriched uranium, has been stymied to some degree. That is not to say that concerns about Iran's nuclear ambitions have abated in any way.  Both Israel and the United States have maintained the view that Iran actively seeks to produce nuclear weapons and that it has sufficient stockpiled low enriched uranium to build up to four nuclear bombs, assuming that further processing was possible.  That being said, the revised timeline would suggest that Israel was unlikely to carry out targeted strikes on nuclear facilities in Iran in the near future.  As well, the United States was highly likely to champion the idea of continuing, and even intensifying, the harsh sanctions* imposed on Iran.  Note that multilateral talks on Iran's nuclear program resumed in late January 2011 in Turkey.

*The punitive  sanctions imposed in June 2010 were regarded as the harshest set of measures to date. The main provisions included an arms embargo, which would prohibit Iran from purchasing heavy weapons, such as attack helicopters and missiles;  stringent rules regarding financial transactions with Iranian banks;  and a wider swath of Iranian individuals and companies to be subject to travel bans and asset freezes. In addition, a new system of cargo inspections would be established to detect and stop Iran from acquiring banned materials.  This round of sanctions was intended to bypass affecting the lives of average Iranians while concentrating on the powerful Iranian Revolutionary Guard, which has emerged as a power center within that country, and which was believed to be the leading entity behind Iran's nuclear ambitions.At the close of February 2011, the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency, the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), expressed concerns about the ""possible military dimensions"" of Iranian nuclear agenda.  At issue was a report by the IAEA that reportedly included the following assessment: ""Based on the agency's analysis of additional information since August 2008, including new information recently received, there are further concerns which the agency also needs to clarify with Iran."" The IAEA then called on Iran to comply with the investigations into Iran's  weapons experiments -- requirements not met by that country since 2008. The report also noted that Iran was not cooperating in the effort to assure the IAEA that all nuclear material in Iran was for only peaceful purposes.  This has been the claim of Iran since the start of its nuclear development program, however, it cannot be verified without that country's cooperation in IAEA investigations.  Clearly, such investigations were unable to be carried out.  Of particular concern was the allegation that Iran was trying to develop nuclear payload for its missiles.

Yet even as these concerns by the United Nations were being expressed, Iran experienced a setback with its nuclear program when unspecified safety concerns compelled technicians to unload fuel rods from the nuclear power plant at Bushehr. Speculation arose as to whether or not the mysterious Stuxnet computer virus may have been to blame for this latest complication with Iran's nuclear development program. Stuxnet --a malicious computer virus believed to be developed either by the Israelis or the Americans --  already resulted in previous setbacks to Iran's overall nuclear program. Fot its part, Iran denied that Stuxnet was a factor. That being said, the plant at Bushehr has never been a concern for the IAEA since it was constructed by Russia under international approval and has been subject to the nuclear watchdog agency's supervision.  That being said, it was clear that Iran was placed in an embarrassing position on the world stage, since the Iranian authorities  have  wasted few opportunities to tout its nuclear success at the Bushehr plant.

As reported by Iranian news, Ali Asghar Soltanieh -- Iran's s ambassador to the IAEA -- explained the situation as follows: ""Upon a demand from Russia, which is responsible for completing the Bushehr nuclear power plant, fuel assemblies from the core of the reactor will be unloaded for a period of time to carry out tests and take technical measurements. ""After the tests are conducted, (the fuel) will be placed in the core of the reactor once again.""

By Feb. 28, 2011, Russia's nuclear energy shed further light on the situation in Iran by explaining that the  order to remove fuel from the nuclear plant was made as a result of concerns that metal particles might be contaminating fuel assemblies.

May 2011 saw the emergence of a report by the United Nations watchdog nuclear agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in which it was reported that Iran was continuing its efforts to build nuclear weapons, in defiance of United Nations sanctions. The IAEA asserted that Iran was stockpiling low-enriched uranium, pointing toward the fact that Iran's total output of low-enriched uranium since 2007 had reached 4.1 tons -- an increase from 3.6 tons earlier in the year, and indicating an amount that, if refined further, could potentially contribute to the development of at least two bombs. Throughout, Iran has claimed that its nuclear program is for civilian energy generating purposes, the actual evidence notwithstanding. The report by the IAEA, which was compiled ahead of a meeting of the IAEA board in June 2011, was expected to be delivered to the United Nations Security Council, where that body would have to consider how to respond to the nuclear developments in Iran. The key question to be addressed would be whether Iran would be regarded as meeting its international obligations in the context of nuclear development.In mid-June 2011, as reported by the Associated Press, Iran was set to install advanced  and efficient centrifuges  -- appropriate for higher grade uranium enrichment -- at its new uranium enrichment site at Qom.  That site at Qom had been constructed secretly, out of the eyes of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).  Ultimately discovered by Western intelligence, revelations about the existence of the Qom site undermined Iran's claims that its nuclear ambitions were peaceful.  Iran's endeavors to produce raw or ""yellowcake"" uranium at the Gachin,  ready for enrichment at the Isfahan conversion facility (publicized in late 2010), only served to further undermine Iran's claims.  A February 2011 by the IAEA further deepened worries about Iran's nuclear ambitions as it noted Iran was trying to develop nuclear payload for its missiles. Indeed, making matters even more intense, Iranian Vice President Fereidoun Abbasi said in June 2011 that his country intended to increased its output of higher enriched uranium threefold in 2011, and that the entire nuclear enrichment program was to be moved to the clandestine facility at Qom.  Of course, enriched uranium at high levels is used for the production of nuclear bombs.  These moves seemed to highlight Iran continuing intransigence about its controversial nuclear program.

By late June 2011, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard tested 14 surface-to-surface missiles as part of its  ""Great Prophet 6"" war games exercises, which were intended as a show of strength towards.  Among the missiles fired nine Zelzal missiles, two Shahab-1s, two Shahab-2s and one upgraded Shahab-3 missile.  It was not immediately known if any of the missiles tested were capable of carrying nuclear weaponry.  According to the Iranian state media, the surface-to-surface missiles had a maximum range of 1,250 miles ( 2,000 kilometers).  The head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards' aerospace division, Commander Amir Ali Hajizadeh, made a point of  noting that  Iran was prepared to retaliate against potential attacks by hostile nations, such as the United States (U.S.) and Israel. Indeed, he emphasized the fact that American military bases were located well within the range of several of the tested missiles, and were therefore vulnerable targets.  At issue for Iran have been suggestions from the U.S. and Israel that they would not foreclose military strikes on Iran if diplomatic overtures do not result in an end to that country's nuclear weapons  development activity.  For its part, the U.S. has noted that the prevailing United Nations Security Council Resolution 1929 levied against Iran prohibits that country from any activity related to ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear weapons.

In a related development, Russia decided to suspend the delivery of S-300 missiles to Iran after the U.S. and Israel conveyed  concern that Iran could use the anti-aircraft missiles as a means to protect its nuclear facilities, which were under scrutiny.

Note that as of mid-July 2011,  Iran's foreign ministry announced that it was installing advanced models of centrifuges for the purpose of  enriching uranium.  Since  the new centrifuges could significantly shorten the time needed to stockpile material used for both civilian and military purposes, the move aimed to accelerate Iran's nuclear development program and promised to raise alarm bells in the West. France quickly responded to the news by condemning Iran's action and casting it as  ""a clear provocation."" France said that Iran's actions clearly undermined that country's claims of a peaceful civilian nuclear program and dispatched a statement which read as follows: ""(It) clearly confirms the suspicions of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and of the international community about the finality of a program with no credible civilian application."" But for its part, Iran appeared undaunted, instead claiming that it had notified the IAEA of its moves to  install new centrifuges.  Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman, Ramin Mehmanparast, said,  ""The agency is aware that our peaceful nuclear activities are progressing ... the installment is a confirmation of the Islamic Republic's success in the nuclear field.""At the start of September 2011, the United Nations' nuclear watchdog agency expressed ""growing concern"" over Iran's controversial nuclear development agenda. At issue was the claim by the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that Iran shows signs of working on a clandestine nuclear weapons program.  The IAEA said that its concerns were based on  ""extensive and comprehensive"" information that had been provided by several countries.  According to extracts of the report detailed by Agence France Presse, the evidence pointed towards the development of a nuclear payload for a missile.  As well, the report indicated Iran's intent to enrich uranium at an underground bunker close to Qom.  It should be noted that  a nuclear facility at Qom was constructed secretly, out of the eyes of the IAEA some time prior.  Ultimately discovered by Western intelligence, revelations about the existence of the Qom site undermined Iran's claims that its nuclear ambitions were peaceful.

Now in 2011, with these concerns mounting on the part of the IAEA, the nuclear watchdog agency's  Director General Yukiya Amano had written to Iran's nuclear chief, Fereydoun Abbasi Davani, to remind that country that it should adhere to its international obligations.  Director General Amano urged Iran to chart the course of prudence in order to establish its credibility in the eyes of the global community, which largely does not believe Iran's claim that its nuclear agenda is peaceful.  Note that the the United Nations Security Council has imposed four rounds of sanctions on Iran due to its refusal to freeze its enrichment program.In the autumn of 2011, the United States was looking to parlay the allegations of attempted assassination and terrorism by the Iranian Quds Force (discussed below)  into international action against Iran's nuclear development program.  To this end, United States President Barack Obama pressured inspectors from the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), to release classified intelligence information illuminating Iran's continuing efforts to develop nuclear weapons technology.

There have been some hints of the evidence against Iran available via the claims of IAEA director, Yukiya Amano, who suggested in September 2011 that Iran was working on nuclear triggers and warheads. According to the New York Times, insiders familiar with the findings of the classified IAEA report have intimated that Iran has made efforts to develop specific  technologies related to the design and detonation of a nuclear device, including the mechanisms for creating detonators,  the method for turning uranium into bomb fuel,  and the formulas for generating neutrons to spur a chain reaction,  and also casting conventional explosives in a shape that could set off a nuclear explosion.

Clearly, coming after the revelations about a disturbing assassination and terrorism plot linked to the Iranian Quds Force, the  move  to declassify the IAEA's report was  oriented toward isolating Iran, now with accentuated political ammunition.  Indeed, the United States aimed to argue the point that Iran was a grave threat to global security,  therefore, the need to halt work on Iran's suspected weapons program was imminent. To this end, Tommy Vietor, a spokesperson for the National Security Council, said: ""The United States believes that a comprehensive assessment would be invaluable for the international community in its consideration of Iran's nuclear program and what to do about it.""

Of course, one of the risks of disclosing the findings of the classified report was that  Iran could move to eject IAEA inspectors from that country, effectively foreclosing one of the few avenues available to the international community to monitor Iran's nuclear activities.

Meanwhile, among the punitive measures being advocated by senior White House officials was a prohibition on financial transactions with Iran's central bank.  Another punitive measure  under consideration was the expansion of the prevailing ban on the purchase of petroleum products sold by Iranian companies under the control of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.

These options have not, in the past, gained traction due to  objections by China among other Asian countries.  In the case of China, as a significant buyer of Iranian oil, that country's energy interests could be affected.  At the same time, key United States allies, such as Japan and South Korea, are also buyers of Iranian oil but additionally handle transactions via the Iranian Central Bank. Complicating the scenario even further, oil and financial sanctions carry with them the threat of spiking the price of oil at a time when the economies of the United States, the European Union, and several other major global players, were enduring sluggish growth.

By the start of November 2011, the Washington Post reported that Iran had received development assistance from experts from Russia, Pakistan, and North Korea to build a nuclear weapon. David Albright, a former official with the IAEA and the president of the Institute for Science and International Security, was reported to have said that while Iran may have halted its nuclear agenda in 2003 due to international pressure, nuclear weapons development research has since kicked into high gear. As stated by Albright in an interview with the Washington Post, ""After 2003, money was made available for research in areas that sure look like nuclear weapons work but were hidden within civilian institutions.""

These allegations were expected to be outlined more fully by the IAEA itself in a new report.  Leaked information suggested that the IAEA report would  register Iran's clandestine nuclear weapons development program, which includes computer models of nuclear warheads.

Indeed, on Nov. 8, 2011, United Nations weapons inspectors released information indicating a  ""credible"" case that ""Iran has carried out activities relevant to the development of a nuclear device"" and arguing that such activities could well be ongoing.  United Nations nuclear inspectors gave no estimate of how long it would be until Iran would be able to produce a nuclear weapon; however, they confirmed the aforementioned claim that Iran had created computer models of nuclear explosions in 2008 and 2009, and conducted experiments on nuclear triggers.  The IAEA was emphatic in noting that the research would only be used to develop a nuclear bomb trigger. In this way, the report, which was published on the Institute for Science and International Security's website, was deemed the most harsh assessment by the IAEA of Iran's nuclear development program.

The IAEA then passed a resolution expressing ""deep and increasing concern"" about Iran's nuclear program, and demanded that Iran clarify outstanding questions related the country's nuclear capabilities. The resolution was adopted following a vote at the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency, with 32 votes inits favor and only Cuba and Ecuador voting against it. Iran's IAEA envoy,  Ali Ashgar Soltanieh , dismissed the development and  said the resolution would only strengthen Iran's resolve to go forward with its nuclear development.  He said, ""It will be business as usual... We will continue our work as before.""

While Iran was not on the verge of a declaration of its nuclear breakout capability, clearly, these revelations would serve to reinvigorate the debate about what method could be used to stop Iran from accessing a nuclear weapon. Under consideration would be options ranging from sanctions, to sabotage and military action.  Despite Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's assertion that the report made clear the need for global action to stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons, Russia wasted no time in foreclosing the possibility of its support for fresh sanctions.  With United Nations sanctions unlikely,  on Nov. 21, 2011, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada slapped fresh sanctions on  Iran's financial and energy sectors.

Iran has argued that its nuclear development program is strictly for civilian energy purposes, but which the West has insisted that Iran seeks nuclear weapons.  Ahead of the aforementioned IAEA report, Iran  rejected the already circulating charges. Indeed, Iran's Foreign Minister Ali-Akbar Salehi said the findings of the IAEA  were ""unfounded and baseless.""Special Report:

U.S uncovers plot by Iranian agents to assassinate Saudi envoy and bomb Saudi and Israeli embassies

Summary:

U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies uncovered a conspiracy plot by Iranian agents working on behalf of the elite Iranian Quds Force. The plot included plans to assassinate the Saudi Arabian ambassador to the United States, and to bomb the Saudi and Israeli embassies in Washington D.C. and Buenos Aires. The White House has promised to hold Tehran responsibility for its involvement in this elaborate plot of assassination and terrorism.  Meanwhile, a connection between the Iranian agents and Mexican drug cartels has been uncovered, effectively complicating the already-tangled web of complex geopolitics.  The U.S. wasted no time in attempting in leveraging these allegations to isolate Iran and place pressure on that country's nucleardevelopment program.

In detail:

Federal law enforcement authorities and intelligence agencies in the United States have reportedly uncovered and foiled a plot by Iranian agents to assassinate the Saudi ambassador to the United States, Adel Al-Jubeir, and to bomb the embassies of Saudi Arabia and Israel in Washington D.C. United States officials indicated there were discussions about extending the bombing targets to the Saudi and Israeli embassies in Buenos Aires -- the capital of Argentina.

According to court documents filed in federal court in the Southern District of New York, the individuals accused of conspiring to carry out this plot were two men of Iranian origin -- Manssor Arbab Arbabsiar and Gholam Shakuri.  One of the men, Arbabsiar, was a naturalized United States citizen holding passports from both the United States and Iran. He was arrested on Sept. 29, 2011, and was said to be in United States custody and cooperating with American authorities.  Indeed, Arbabsiar confessed his involvement in the plot, according to media reports. The other man, Shakuri, was apparently still at large, presumably in Iran where he was reported to be a member of Iran's Quds Force --  --  an elite division  of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.

Both defendants were charged with conspiracy to murder a foreign official; conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction (explosives); and conspiracy to commit an act of international terrorism transcending national boundaries. Arbabsiar was further charged with an additional count of foreign travel and use of interstate and foreign commerce facilities in the commission of murder-for-hire. Arbabsiar was due to appear in a federal court in New York; if convicted of all charges, he would face life imprisonment.

In a news conference on Oct. 11, 2011, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said: ""The criminal complaint unsealed today exposes a deadly plot directed by factions of the Iranian government to assassinate a foreign Ambassador on United States soil with explosives."" He continued, ""Through the diligent and coordinated efforts of our law enforcement and intelligence agencies, we were able to disrupt this plot before anyone was harmed.  We will continue to investigate this matter vigorously and bring those who have violated any laws to justice.""

Attorney General Holder explained that while payment for the operation had already been transferred via a New York bank, the conspiracy had not yet progressed to the point of the suspects acquiring explosives for the bombing aspect of the operation.  Attorney General Holder also confirmed reports that Arbabsiar and Shakuri were connected to the Quds Force --  the elite division of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, which has been accused of being responsible for operations in other countries, and which has been a major player in Iran's controversial nuclear development program.  Attorney General Holder additionally made it clear that the plot was ""conceived"" in Iran by the Quds force, effectively drawing a clear  line of connection to Iran's power base.

Attorney General was unrestrained in his characterization of the plot, which he said had been orchestrated from the spring of 2011 to October 2011.  He emphatically asserted that the conspiracy was  ""conceived, sponsored and directed by Iran,"" and warned that the White House would hold Tehran accountable for it alleged involvement in an elaborate plot of assassination and terrorism.  It should be noted that United States officials were tying the plot to high levels of the Iranian government, albeit not directly to the Iranian president or ayatollah.  It  should also be noted that the United States Department of State has listed Iran as a ""state sponsor"" of terrorism since 1984; now in 2011, this latest revelation of an international conspiracy would no doubt reify that classification.

A Justice Department report detailed Arbabsiar's recruitment by senior officials in Iran's Quds Force, which reportedly funded and directed the elaborate assassination and terror plot. Extracts from that Justice Department report also indicated that Arbabsiar had gone so far as to discuss a Washington D.C. restaurant frequented by the Saudi ambassador and United States senators, as a possible venue for the target of the assassination.  Those extracts suggested that high level Iranians were unconcerned about the additional collateral damage to American politicians or civilians in carrying out such an attack.  As the trusted and long-serving envoy of Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah, the assassination of United States-educated Adel Al-Jubeir, along with potential deaths of United States citizens, would undoubtedly cause international furor.

There was an additional international trajectory, reminiscent of a Hollywood movie script, as the Iranian agents were trying to secure the assistance of Mexican drug cartels in carrying out the assassination element of the plot.  Indeed, Arbabsiar was arrested as he attempted to travel to Mexico to meet with a Mexican drug cartel operative, allegedly to move forward with this plan.  The Mexican informant was, in fact, working on behalf of the United States Drug Enforcement Agency.  The involvement of Iranian agents, Mexican drug cartels, and terror targets on United States and Argentine soil, belonging to Israeli, and Saudi interests, effectively complicated the already-tangled web of complex geopolitics and international intrigue.

The mechanics of the plot notwithstanding, there would no doubt be questions about the motivation for the Iranian Quds Force to act against Saudi and Israeli interests on United States and Argentine soil.  Of course, Iran's government has never restrained its expression of enmity for Israel; its antagonism towards Saudi Arabia is more opaque.

In fact, the Middle East has become the terrain of an ethno-sectarian power struggle between Sunni Islamic Saudi Arabia and Shi'a Iran in regional countries with mixed and complicated demographic mixtures of Sunnis and Shi'ites.  According to United States authorities,  Iranian-backed militias have been responsible for the upsurge in sectarian violence in post-invasion Iraq, where Shi'a Iran hopes to extend its influence. United States authorities have also alleged that the Iranian Quds Force has been instrumental in attacking American troops in Iraq.

Likewise, in Bahrain, which has a similar Shi'a-Sunni demographic composition as Iraq, and which has seen its own episode of unrest in the so-called 2011 ""Arab Spring,"" Iran's desire to extend its influence was apparent.  Specifically, as Saudi Arabian troops aided the Bahraini government in cracking down on the predominantly Shi'a opposition in Bahrain, Iran was quick to condemn the presence of foreign forces there.  The scenario was a clear manifestation of the prevailing power struggle between the two sectarian power houses of the region -- Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shi'a Iran.  Thus, it was quite possible that this 2011 assassination and terror plot was another such manifestation of these tensions.

There was little doubt that the matter would be taken to the United Nations Security Council, where veto-wielding permanent seat holders, China and Russia, have been reluctant to take strong measures against Iran in regard to that country's controversial nuclear development program and its failure to abide with international conventions. Indeed, concurrence by China and Russia on the 2010 United Nations Security Council resolution against Iran was only reached due to Iran's unambiguous failure to comply with the standards imposed by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and the revelations about clandestine nuclear sites. Now, in 2011,  with news of this assassination and terrorism plot, and the implicating of the Iranian regime, heavy pressure would be placed  on China and Russia to again act in concert with the broader international community.

At the diplomatic level, the Saudi embassy in the United States released a strong statement of appreciation for the United States government for uncovering and foiling the plot. As well, during a news conference on Oct. 11, 2011, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton delivered a vociferous warning to Tehran that her country would be working with the international community to isolate Iran, and to ensure that it would be held accountable for its actions in violation of international norms.  Days later, United States President Barack Obama fortified his country's stance by confirming that Iran would pay a price for its involvement in this assassination and terrorism plot.  ""We're going to continue... to mobilize the international community to make sure that Iran is further and further isolated and pays a price for this kind of behavior,"" President Obama said.  The United States leader stopped short of accusing the uppermost leadership echelon of the Iranian government of being involved in the alleged plot; however, he noted that even if  Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei or President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  did not possess operational knowledge of the plot, ""there has to be accountability with respect to anybody in the Iranian government engaging in this kind of activity.""

For its part, the Iranian government has mocked any claims of its complicity in the conspiracy, suggesting that the entire situation had been a sensationalized scheme fabricated by the United States.  It should be noted that the Revolutionary Guards holds control over Iran's nuclear program, as well as being the over-arching authority at the helm of the Quds Force -- the very group believed to behind the assassination and terrorism plot discussed here.Special ReportIran under isolation  --As discussed above, due to revelations about Iran's nuclear development program,  the International Atomic Energy Agency passed a resolution expressing ""deep and increasing concern"" about Iran's nuclear program, and demanded that Iran clarify outstanding questions related the country's nuclear capabilities. The resolution was adopted following a vote at the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency, with 32 votes inits favor and only Cuba and Ecuador voting against it.

The resolution stopped short of directly accusing Tehran of the plot,  but nonetheless demanded that Iran ""comply with all of its obligations under international law"" and ""co-operate with states seeking to bring to justice all those who participated in the planning, sponsoring,organization and attempted execution of the plot.""

With international pressure being intensified against  Iran, the Iranian regime appeared to be reacting by lashing out at the Western world.  With hostilities already high between Iran and the United States, Tehran appeared to be taking aim at the United Kingdom.  To this end,  by the close of  November 2011, Iran's  Guardian Council of the Constitution unanimously voted to reduce diplomatic ties with the United Kingdom. The change would downgrade diplomatic ties with the United Kingdom from the ambassador level to the level of charge d'affaires within a two-week timeframe. Ratification by the Guardian Council came after a vote in the Iranian Majlis or parliament, approving  this move.  Iranian radio reported that during the vote, several members of parliament changed ""death to Britain.""  Iran was reacting to pressure from Western countries, including the United Kingdom, to place greater political and economic pressure on Iran, and particularly, the Central Bank of Iran,in the wake of the aforementioned report by the IAEA.With international pressure being intensified against  Iran, the Iranian regime appeared to be reacting by lashing out at the Western world.  With hostilities already high between Iran and the United States, Tehran appeared to be taking aim at the United Kingdom.  To this end,  by the close of  November 2011, Iran's  Guardian Council of the Constitution unanimously voted to reduce diplomatic ties with the United Kingdom.

In a further sign that Iran's relations with the countries of the West were on a downward slide, Nov. 29, 2011 saw militant students aligned with the hard line conservative government in Tehran storm the British embassy compound.  This action appeared to be part of a violent demonstration against the government of the United Kingdom, which joined the United States in issuing new financial sanctions against Iran.  The militant activists reportedly chanted, ""death to England ,"" vandalized the embassy offices, seized sensitive documents, briefly detained some diplomatic personnel, and burned the British flag in acts that constituted  flagrant violations of diplomatic norms.  A separate attack by militant students and activists on a British diplomatic compound in northern Tehran was also confirmed by the British Foreign Office.  The scenario disturbingly  recalled the shocking assault  on the American Embassy in 1979 following Iran's Islamic Revolution.

Although Iran expressed ""regret"" over the attacks on the British embassy and secondary diplomatic compound, witnesses on the ground in Iran suggested that Iranian security forces did little to quickly end the outbreak of violence against a diplomatic interest.  Indeed, police reportedly allowed the scene to play out for several hours before taking control of the situation.  There were serious allegations mounting that the assault on the British embassy compounds had taken place with approval from Iranian authorities. Furthermore, speculation rested on the involvement of the regime-backed Basiji militia. For his part, British Prime Minister David Cameron said: ""The attack on the British embassy in Tehran today was outrageous and indefensible.""  British authorities warned its citizens in Iran to remain indoors and await advice; they also warned of consequences for Iran in the offing, and summoned the Iranian charge d'affaires.

The United Kingdom on Nov. 30, 2011 officially downgraded its ties with Iran.  The United Kingdom withdrew all its diplomats from Iran, closed its embassy in Tehran, urged its citizens to exit that country, and  gave Iran 48 hours to remove all its staff from the Iranian diplomatic mission in London. Officials in the United Kingdom also went on the record to note that they believe the attacks on the British embassy in Tehran and the secondary compound were carried out with the tacit approval of Iran's leadership. British Foreign Secretary William Hague, asserted that there had been ""some degree of regime consent"" in the attacks on the embassy and the other diplomatic compound in Tehran. Dominick Chilcott, the newly-appointed British ambassador to Iran, said: ""This was a state-supported activity."" In an interview with BBC News, Ambassador Chilcott said that Iran was a country in which an attack on an embassy was conducted only ""with the acquiescence and the support of the state."" These moves collectively marked the worst deterioration of ties between the United Kingdom and Iran in decades.

The United Kingdom was backed by the  15-nation United Nations Security Council, which condemned the attack ""in the strongest terms.""  Separately, United States President Barack Obama called for the Iranian government to ensure those responsible faced justice. Germany's Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle characterized the attacks on the British embassy compounds as ""a violation of international law.""  French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe placed the blame on the Iranian government, saying: ""The Iranian regime has shown what little consideration it has for international  law.""

Several European countries -- such as France, Germany,  Italy and the Netherlands -- wasted no time in joining the Western thrust to diplomatically isolate Iran by recalling their own ambassadors from Tehran.  France took a further step by withdrawing its embassy staff from Iran.  French officials said the move was being made out of an abundance of caution, given the security risks in Iran to Western interests. France's calls for a ban on Iranian oil imports and a freeze on central bank assets was expected to heighten bilateral tensions, and effectively place France in Iran's  firing line, along with the United Kingdom. Russia, which has often been accused by the West of being ""soft"" on Iran joined the condemnation of the attacks.

At home in Iran, militant activist students in that country were  at the airport in Tehran, waiting to welcome the expelled Iranian diplomats from London, and chanting slogans, such as ""Death to Britain.""  The returning diplomats, however, never had any direct encounters with the students at the airport.

The situation appeared to highlight cleavages in the Iranian leadership regarding the diplomatic farrago. For example, in an interview with Iran's state-run IRNA news agency, Grand Ayatollah Naser Makarem Shirazi  said,  ""There is no doubt that Britain is one of the oldest enemies of Iran.""  He appeared to offer  a slight rebuke to the militant activists who attacked the British embassy, adding:  ""Young revolutionaries should not go beyond the law.""  Meanwhile, the Iranian government targeted the United Kingdom for exacerbating tensions between that country and the West, as Iranian foreign ministry spokesman, Ramin Mehmanparast, said: ""The British government is trying to extend to other European countries the problem between the two of us."" As the year 2011 drew to a close, bilateral relations between the United States and Iran -- already dismally bad -- sunk even lower as an American drone was reported to be in Iranian hands. The official account was that the American drone had been flying in -- or close to -- Iranian air space, and somehow crashed.  The drone, with its sensitive intelligence information, was then taken by Iranian authorities.  But a report by the Christian Science Monitor suggested that Iran's possession of the drone may not have been the result of an accidental crash.  Instead, according to an Iranian engineer,  the country hijacked the drone  and was able to technically take control of the aircraft by jamming the control signals, ultimately forcing it into autopilot mode.  The Iranians then vitiated the GPS tracking by reconfiguring the GPS coordinates, effectively ""fooling"" the drone into landing  in Iran, rather than in Afghanistan, which was where it was programmed to land. The images of the American drone in Iran's possession depict an aircraft remarkably intact -- rather than being subject to crash -- thus bolstering the credibility of the report by the Christian Science Monitor. Meanwhile,  in December 2011,  Iran claimed that it successfully test-fired a medium-range surface-to-air missile during military exercises in the Persian Gulf at the close of 2011.Mousavi also noted that further missile launches would be carried out in the near future as part of Iran's  naval exercises in international waters close to the strategic Strait of Hormuz. On Jan. 2, 2012,  a day after testing a medium-range missile, Iran reportedly test-fired long-range missiles in the Persian Gulf.This news served only to bolster Western fears that Iran has made important progress in its nuclear development, augmenting anxieties that Iran's ultimate ambition is to  enrich uranium at the 90 per cent level necessary to create a nuclear bomb.

This development came as several Western countries indicated their to impose further sanctions on Iran's oil and financial sectors, to register discontent over that country's continued nuclear ambitions.  On Dec. 31, 2011, President  Barack Obama signed legislation authorizing a package ofsanctionsIran's central bank and financial sector.  These new sanctions by the United States aimed to intensify the pressure on Iran's oil sales, most of which are processed by the central bank. Essentially, they would force multinational companies to choose whether to do business with Iran or the United States.  Perhaps not surprisingly, the Iranian currency -- the rial -- slipped in value to a record low as a result of the news.For its part,  Iran has warned that it might retaliate against international pressure by closing the Strait of Hormuz through which a significant amount of oil is transported.  Indeed, Iranian Vice President Mohammad Reza Rahimi promised that ""not a drop of oil will pass through the Strait of Hormuz"" if further sanctions were imposed.  That being said, analysts have noted that such a drastic step by Iran might serve primarily to hurt the Iranian economy, and imperil relations with Russia and China.  Accordingly, the threat was being regarded through the prism of skepticism.Moreover, United States Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta warned that a closure of the strait would yield consequences.

Iran was increasingly slipping into a state of isolation. China and Russia -- typically antagonists to the notion of increased pressure on that country -- seemed to be distancing themselves from Iran.  China was reportedly seeking alternative sources of oil, while Russia wwas expressing ""regret"" over Tehran's decision to start work at the new Fordow uranium enrichment plant near Qom.  Russia went further by saying that Iran should commence ""serious negotiations … without preconditions"" or face the reality of consequences.It should be noted that on Jan. 5, 2012, the United States (U.S.)  Pentagon announced that the U.S. Navy rescued 13 Iranian fishermen being held by pirates in the Arabian Sea. According to the Pentagon, the U.S. Navy responded to a  distress call from an Iranian fishing vessel, which had been boarded by pirates several weeks prior. The U.S. Navy was able to apprehend 15 suspected pirates on that fishing vessel and release the Iranian fishermen whom the Pentagon described as having been held hostage under harsh conditions.  A spokesperson for the U.S. Navy said that after the rescue of the Iranian fishermen,  navy personnel went out of their way to treat the fishing crew ""with kindness and respect."" 

The incident occurred at a time when tensions between Iran and the West were elevated.  Several Western countries had recently indicated their intent to impose further sanctions on Iran's oil and financial sectors, for the purpose of registering discontent over that country's continued nuclear ambitions. Iran warned that it might retaliate against international pressure by closing the Strait of Hormuz through which a significant amount of oil is transported.

Only days after the U.S. Navy rescued the Iranian fishermen (as discussed here), the Iranian Revolutionary Court sentenced an American national of Iranian descent to  death sentence for spying in behalf of the United States spy agency, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The family of Amir Mirzai Hekmati said that he was in Iran to visit his grandparents; however, the Iranian authorities claimed that Hekmati was guilty of  ""co-operating with a hostile nation,"" ""holding membership in the CIA,"" and ""trying to implicate Iran in terrorism.""  For his part, Hekmati -- who had served in the Marines as an Arabic translator -- was shown on television admitting that he had been sent to Iran by the CIA and was tasked with infiltrate Iran's intelligence agencies.  Of course, the United States Department of State has asserted that Hekmati's so-called confession was likely coerced and that the U.S. citizen had been falsely accused.

Hekmati would have the opportunity to appeal his sentence; it was yet to be seen if Iranian authorities were willing to damage already-hostile bilateral relations with the United States by executing a U.S. citizen.  Such a move would not help Iran in the public relations game on the international scene, given the fact that the U.S. Navy had rescued the aforementioned Iranian fishermen from pirates.As discussed above, Iran's controversial nuclear program returned to the international spotlight in January 2012 when  a nuclear scientist working at Iran's Natanz uranium enrichment plant was killed in a car bomb attack.  The magnetic bomb was reportedly attached to to the vehicle carrying the nuclear scientist by  a motorcycle rider.  Iranian officials wasted no time in blaming Israel for the death of Mostafa Ahmadi Roshan, which they said was quite similar to the killings of other Iranian nuclear scientists. There was no immediate response from Israeli officials as to this allegation.  That being said, the French newspaper, Le Figaro,  has reported that the Israeli Mossad has been training Iranian dissidents in Iraqi Kurdistan to destabilize the Iranian regime.  There was no actual evidence that Israeli-trained Iranians  were behind the assassination of Roshan in Tehran;  however, Israeli Mossad's hand has been suspected in a number of targeted killings of Iranian nuclear scientists, effectively fueling speculation about a covert effort to undermine Iran's nuclear program. Meanwhile, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton vociferously denied her country's involvement in the incident.Special Report: Iran's nuclear program in global context

Nuclear development, assassination, and brinkmanship at Strait of Hormuz

At the close of 2011, according to reports via the state-run media, Iran successfully test-fired a medium-range surface-to-air missile during military exercises in the Persian Gulf.Iranian naval commander Mahmoud Mousavi lauded the operation, noting the missile was equipped with the ""latest technology"" and ""intelligent systems.""  Mousavi also noted that further missile launches would be carried out in the near future as part of Iran's  naval exercises in international waters close to the strategic Strait of Hormuz.

On Jan. 2, 2012 --  one day after testing a medium-range missile --  Iran reportedly test-fired long-range missiles in the Persian Gulf.  Making good on his previously-made vow that Iran would continue this path, Mousavi said on behalf of the Iranian government, ""We have test fired a long-range shore-to-sea missile called Qader, which managed to successfully destroy predetermined targets in the gulf.""

This news by Mousavi was followed by a disclosure by the Iranian Atomic Energy Organization that its scientists ""tested the first nuclear fuel rod produced from uranium ore deposits inside the country.""  As well, the IAEA was soon noting that uranium enrichment had begun at the Fordow underground site near Qom.  Indeed, the uranium at the Fordow site was reportedly being enriched to 20 percent -- a distinctly higher level than the 3.5 percent needed for nuclear plants. These disclosures served only to bolster Western fears that Iran has made important progress in its nuclear development, augmenting anxieties that Iran's ultimate ambition is to  enrich uranium at the 90 percent level necessary to create a nuclear bomb.

It should be noted that these revelations from Iran came after  several Western countries indicated their intent to impose further sanctions on Iran's oil and financial sectors, for the purpose of registering  discontent over that country's continued nuclear ambitions.  Indeed, the United States wasted no time in taking action and on Dec. 31, 2011, President  Barack Obama signed legislation authorizing a package of sanctions on  Iran's central bank and financial sector.  These new sanctions by the United States aimed to intensify the pressure on Iran's oil sales, most of which are processed by the central bank. Essentially, they would force multinational companies to choose whether to do business with Iran or the United States.  Perhaps not surprisingly, the Iranian currency -- the rial -- slipped in value to a record low as a result of the news.

For its part, Iran has warned that it might retaliate against international pressure by closing the Strait of Hormuz through which a significant amount of oil is transported.  Indeed, Iranian Vice President Mohammad Reza Rahimi promised that ""not a drop of oil will pass through the Strait of Hormuz"" if further sanctions were imposed.  That being said, analysts have noted that such a drastic step by Iran might serve primarily to hurt the Iranian economy, and imperil relations with Russia and China.  Accordingly, the threat was being regarded with skepticism.Moreover, United States Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta warned that a closure of the strait would yield consequences.  Specifically, Defense Secretary Panetta said  the United States  would ""not tolerate"" the blocking of the Strait of Hormuz, and warned that was a ""red line"" for his country, to which there would be a response.

Iran was increasingly slipping into a state of isolation. China and Russia -- typically antagonists to the notion of increased pressure on that country -- seemed to be distancing themselves from Iran.  China was reportedly seeking alternative sources of oil, while Russia was expressing ""regret"" over Tehran's decision to start work at the new Fordow uranium enrichment plant near Qom.  Russia went further by saying that Iran should commence ""serious negotiations … without preconditions"" or face the reality of consequences.

Iran's controversial nuclear program continued to dominate the international landscape well into the second week of January 2012 when an apparent  nuclear scientist working at Iran's Natanz uranium enrichment plant was killed in a car bomb attack.  The magnetic bomb was reportedly attached to  the vehicle carrying the nuclear scientist by  a motorcycle rider.  According to the Sharif University in Tehran, Roshan, a chemistry expert, graduated from that institution and was working as the deputy in charge of commerce at the Natanz site.  The actual attack ensued outside the campus of Allameh Tabatai University, where Roshan was a lecturer.

Iranian officials wasted no time in blaming Israel for the death of Mostafa Ahmadi Roshan, which they said was quite similar to the killings of other Iranian nuclear scientists. Tehran province Gov. Safar Ali Bratloo said in an interview with the media, ""The responsibility of this explosion falls on the Zionist regime. The method of this terrorist action is similar to previous actions that targeted Iran's nuclear scientists."" Joining the chorus, Iran's First Vice President Mohammad-Reza Rahimi accused Israeli agents of being the perpetrators of Roshan's assassination.

There was no immediate response from Israeli officials as to this allegation.  That being said, the French newspaper, Le Figaro,  has reported that the Israeli Mossad has been training Iranian dissidents in Iraqi Kurdistan to destabilize the Iranian regime.  There was no actual evidence that Israeli-trained Iranians  were behind the assassination of Roshan in Tehran;  however, Israeli Mossad's hand has been suspected in a number of targeted killings of Iranian nuclear scientists, effectively fueling speculation about a covert effort to undermine Iran's nuclear program. Moreover,  Patrick Clawson of the Iran Security Initiative at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy noted that such covert efforts  were preferable to a more direct military response.  In an interview with the New York Times, he said, ""Sabotage and assassination is the way to go, if you can do it. It doesn't provoke a nationalist reaction in Iran, which could strengthen the regime. And it allows Iran to climb down if it decides the cost of pursuing a nuclear weapon is too high.""

Meanwhile, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was vociferously denying her country's involvement in the incident. During a media briefing, the United States' top diplomat said, ""I want to categorically deny any United States involvement in any kind of act of violence inside Iran.""  But Secretary of State Clinton discussed other issues related to Iran's relationship with the wider world.  She drew attention to Iran's recent missile launches and nuclear development activities, strongly demanding that Iran ""end its provocative behavior, end its search for nuclear weapons, and rejoin the international community and be a productive member of it.""  Additionally, she discussed Iran's threat to close the critically-important Straits of Hormuz, saying, ""It's part of the lifeline that keeps oil and gas moving around the world. And it's also important to speak as clearly as we can to the Iranians about the dangers of this kind of provocation.""

According to the New York Times, the Obama administration in the United States reportedly dispatched a message via alternative communications channels to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei  warning him that the closure of the Strait of Hormuz would not be tolerated.  In a separate report on CBS News, the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman General Martin Dempsey appeared to underline the potential response by his country, saying that the United States would ""take action and re-open the strait.""  Of course, the general consensus was that the re-opening of the Strait of Hormuz  could only be achieved  by military means.Recent Developments: Confrontation or Negotiation?

Clearly, the missile launch, the nuclear development news, the  sanctions, the threats regarding the closure of the Strait of Hormuz,  and the targeted assassination of an Iranian nuclear scientist, collectively raised the stakes in a burgeoning confrontation between  Iran and the wider international community.  As January 2012 was coming to a close, attention was on the question of what form that confrontation would take.

Going the route of ""soft power"" rather than military might, the West wasted no time in intensifying the sanctions regime against Iran in a bid to place pressure on the Islamic Republic's regime to curtail its controversial nuclear development moves. Specifically, the European Union was imposing a phased ban on oil purchases from Iran, while the United States was expanding its sanctions on Iran's banking sector.

According to a statement issued in Belgium,  the countries of the European Union would not sign on to new oil contracts with Iran and would terminate any existing contracts by mid-2012.  Since the European market has made up a full fifth of Iran's oil exports, this sweeping oil embargo would constitute a crushing blow.  Making matters worse for Iran was the news that the European Union would also  freeze the assets of the Iranian Central Bank and it would prohibit transactions involving Iranian diamonds, gold, and precious metals.

Expressing marked disapproval for Tehran's lack of transparency regarding its nuclear program, British Prime Minister David Cameron, French President Nicolas Sarkozy, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that Iran had ""failed to restore international confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear program.""

Meanwhile, the United States' harsh sanctions regime  against Iran would become even more targeted as it focused on the Bank Tejarat for its alleged role in (1) financing Iran's nuclear program,  and  (2) helping other banks evade international sanctions. In December 2011, United States President Barack Obama ordered a prohibition on any involvement with Iran's central bank. Now, a month later, the United States Treasury  was asserting that the new sanctions against Bank Tejarat would target ""one of Iran's few remaining access points to the international financial system.""

Already diplomatically-isolated, Iran was  now well on its way to being seriously financially isolated in the global marketplace. As noted by the United States Treasury Undersecretary for Terrorism David Cohen, ""The new round of sanctions will deepen Iran's financial isolation, make its access to hard currency even more tenuous and further impair Iran's ability to finance its illicit nuclear program.""  Indeed, the rial -- Iran's currency -- was being deleteriously affected as it underwent a massive downward slide in value.

In apparent reaction to the measures by the United States and the European Union, Tehran  again threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz.

The level of brinkmanship reached new heights as the United States Ambassador to NATO, Ivo Daalder, promised that his country and its allies would use any necessary measures to ensure that the crucial marine thoroughfare to the Persian Gulf remained open. In an interview with BBC News, Daalder said the Strait of Hormuz  ""needs to remain open and we need to maintain this as an international passageway.  We will do what needs to be done to ensure that is the case.""  He continued, ""Of this I am certain -- the international waterways that go through the Strait of Hormuz are to be sailed by international navies, including ours, the British and the French and any other navy that needs to go through the Gulf. And second, we will make sure that that happens under every circumstance.""

Daalder did not foreclose the possibility of a diplomatic solution, saying that the countries of the West stood ""ready at any time to sit down and have a serious conversation with [Iran] to resolve this [nuclear] issue with negotiations.""

Just days after the war of words was being ratcheted upward, Iranian  President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad declared that Tehran was prepared  to return to negotiating table as regards its nuclear program.  On Jan. 26, 2012, Ahmadinejad said  he was open to the idea of reviving multilateral talks in order to show that Iran remained interested in dialogue. At the start of 2011, negotiations between Iran and a cadre of six nations (the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council -- the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Russia and China) as well as Germany -- ended in stalemate. Indeed, those talks were marked by Iran's refusal to engage in any meaningful dialogue regarding its nuclear program.  Now, a year later, Ahmadinejad  said on state-run Iranian television, ""They have this excuse that Iran is dodging negotiations while it is not the case. Why should we run away from the negotiations?""

There was some suggestion that Iran's interest in a return to the negotiating table might be a sign that international pressure was taking a toll.  That being said, Ahmadinejad's words could just as easily be interpreted as a symbolic gesture by a figure head intent on rallying national sentiment.  To that end, Ahmadinejad suggested the West was responsible for the collapse of negotiations to date, saying. ""It is the West that needs Iran and the Iranian nation will not lose from the sanctions. It is you who come up with excuses each time and issue resolutions on the verge of talks so that negotiations collapse.""

Note that as January 2012 came to a close, inspectors from the IAEA arrived in Iran for a visit to determine the purpose of that country's nuclear development program. Yukiya Amano, the head of the IAEA, expressed hope that the ""outstanding issues"" regarding Iran's nuclear development would be resolved.  Meanwhile, just before departing for Iran, IAEA Deputy Director General Herman Nackaerts said, ""In particular we hope that Iran will engage with us on our concerns regarding the possible military dimensions of Iran's nuclear program.""  For its part, Iran said the inspection would finally prove that Iran's nuclear ambitions were peaceful.

Update: International Pressure

As February 2012 began, Israel entered the Iranian nuclear fray.  Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak indicated that if sanctions against Iran did not serve to curtail that country's nuclear development, then his country would be willing to consider military action against Iran, before it could become a global threat. Barak said, ""Should sanctions fail to stop Iran's nuclear program, there will be a need to consider taking action."" Barak continued, ""There is widespread international belief that it is vital to prevent Iran from turning nuclear and that no option should be taken off the table.""  As regards the prospects of Iran ""turning nuclear,""  Israel's director of military intelligence, Major General Aviv Kochavi warned that Iran was close to being able  to produce nuclear bombs.

It should be noted that United States Defense Secretary Leon Panetta expressed the view that Israel could very well strike Iran in the spring of 2012 -- citing a timeline of April through June.  Panetta was cited in an article written by the Washington Post columnist David Ignatius, which suggested that Israel sought to hit Iran's nuclear targets before that country entered a ""zone of immunity"" in the effort to build a nuclear bomb. The article noted that the United States was opposed to such an attack, noting that it would imperil an increasingly successful non-military effort to isolate Iran, including the imposition of a harsh international economic sanctions program.  Indeed, the Obama administration in the United States was reportedly worried about the ""unintended consequences"" of military action by Israel.

For its part, Iran had already said it was undeterred by either sanctions or threats of military action.  Iranian Oil Minister Rostam Qassemi said  the country would continue with its nuclear agenda regardless of pressure from foreign countries.  At a news conference, he said, ""We will not give up our righteous stance."" Qassemi also  was unconcerned about the notion of oil embargoes, even threatening to cut oil exports to certain countries -- presumably ones participating in any pressuring actions against Tehran.

As well, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei had earlier claimed that Iran was actually benefiting from Western sanctions. He insisted that the sanctions were helping his country to grow domestically, and said that war would only hurt the United States and other Western countries.  Moreover, Khamenei issued a disturbing warning that Iran had its own ""threats to make, which will be made in its due time."" It was not known if those future threats would be of a military nature although Iran began military drills on Feb. 5, 2012.  At that time, Iran's military made clear that it would react quickly to any military attack  from an external power on its interests.

By Feb. 6, 2012, United States President Barack Obama announced the imposition of  new sanctions against Iran's banks, including its central bank, the Iranian government, and  all other Iranian financial institutions. In a letter to Congress detailing his executive order, President Obama wrote: ""I have determined that additional sanctions are warranted, particularly in light of the deceptive practices of the Central Bank of Iran and other Iranian banks to conceal transactions of sanctioned parties, the deficiencies in Iran's anti-money laundering regime and the weaknesses in its implementation, and the continuing and unacceptable risk posed to the international financial system by Iran's activities.""  As before, the United States was hoping that the even stricter sanctions regime would further isolate Iran.

President Obama also made it clear that the United States would stand in solidarity with Israel to prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear power. In an interview with the NBC news, President Obama said the United States and Israel would work ""in lockstep"" to deal with the Iranian nuclear issue. ""I will say that we have closer military and intelligence consultation between our two countries than we've ever had.""  President Obama also emphasized that while his objective was to resolve the nuclear standoff diplomatically, he was not taking any options off the table.

Of course, as noted above, the United States has sought to discourage Israel from going down the military route.  This stance was emphasized on Feb. 19, 2012 when Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in an interview with CNN that  his country viewed a military strike on Iran by Israel as ""not prudent."" Dempsey noted that United States officials were attempting to move Israel away from that path saying, ""That's been our counsel to our allies, the Israelis.""  He continued, ""I'm confident that they [the Irsaelis] understand our concerns that a strike at this point would be destabilizing and wouldn't achieve their long-term objectives.""  That said,  Dempsey had no illusions about the effectiveness of this argument as he noted: ""I wouldn't suggest, sitting here today, that we've persuaded them that our view is the correct view.  Nevertheless, Dempsey suggested that Iran was  ""a rational actor"" and ""the current path [re: diplomacy and sanctions] that we're on is the most prudent at this point.""

The ""soft power"" of crippling sanctions has, in fact, been yielding results. According to a report by Reuters, Iran was finding it difficult to purchase staples such as rice and cooking oil, which  are needed to feed its population.  For example, Malaysian exporters of palm oil stopped sales to Iran because they could not receive payment.  Likewise, there were reports that Iran had defaulted on payments for rice from India -- its main  supplier.  As well, shipments of maize from Ukraine had apparently been cut in half. Meanwhile, the price of basic food was exponentially escalating. Meanwhile, countries around the world that previously did business with Iran, such as South Korea, were looking for alternative sources of oil.  As well, multinational corporations based in Europe were suspending deals with Iran due to the new European Union sanctions.

Perhaps more detrimental for Iran were obstacles in  selling its oil and receiving payments for its oil  exports. In places where Iran is still able to sell oil, it has been stymied from receipt of funds due to prevailing sanctions, especially those levied by the United States.  And in another twist, if Iran cannot sell its typical  2.6 million barrels of oil a day, or, it it must  sell those barrels at deep discounts, the decreased revenue will inevitably have a debilitating effect on the Iranian economy, adding to the possibility of social unrest.

These findings from international commodities traders, which were part of a Reuters investigation, indicated real disruptions to Iran and flew in the face of claims from Tehran that sanctions were having no effect.

Note that the Iranian regime on Feb. 19, 2012 said that it would halt oil sales to British and French companies, saying that it would instead sell oil to new customers.  But with prevailing European Union sanctions set to go into effect, this news was unlikely to strongly affect France, which only bought three percent of is oil from Iran the previous year anyway, or the United Kingdom, which imported even less Iranian oil. As discussed here, it was Iran that was more likely to be affected negatively by curtailed oil sales.

Iran promises big nuclear announcement and possible military action

Note that on Feb. 11, 2012,  during a rally marking the 33rd anniversary of the Islamic Revolution, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said his country would unveil ""major achievements in the nuclear domain.""He said, ""Today, you see that the Iranian nation has become nuclear and can supply many of its demands. And God-willing, in next few days, the whole world will witness the inauguration of several major achievements in the nuclear domain.""  On a televised broadcast days later, the Iranian president declared that his country had developed ""advanced nuclear centrifuges,"" and that scientists had inserted nuclear fuel rods into Tehran's reactor that were  enriched to 20 percent. Ahmadinejad also defiantly made clear that Iran had no intention of halting its uranium enrichment program.

The West offered a symbolic yawn in response to Iran's nuclear announcement.  France and the United Kingdom issued pro forma statements of ""concern"" while the United States Department of State spokeswoman, Victoria Nuland, dismissed the announcement as ""not terribly new and not terribly impressive.""

But on Feb. 21, 2012, Iran was now taking a belligerent tone as regards the prospects of military action with an Iranian military commander declaring that his country will take pre-emptive actions against enemies if its national interests are threatened.  The deputy head of Iran's armed forces, Mohammad Hejazi, said in an interview with the Iranian Fars news agency, ""Our strategy now is that if we feel our enemies want to endanger Iran's national interests, and want to decide to do that, we will act without waiting for their actions."" Since Iran's leadership has a tendency to assert the country's ability to crush perceived enemies, it was difficult to determine if this statement should be regarded as the ratcheting up of rhetoric or a warning.

IAEA visit to Iran ends in failure; reports increased uranium enrichment

Note that in mid-February 2012, a delegation from the International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA) had arrived in Iran for a second trip in less than a month  to attend talks on the country's nuclear program.  Officials from the international nuclear watchdog agency said that they hoped for a ""constructive visit.""

On Feb. 24, 2012, however, the IAEA concluded that Iran was not cooperative and that prevailing questions regarding the possible military dimension of the Iranian nuclear development program remained unanswered. Of particular concern was the fact that  the IAEA was prohibited by the Iranian authorities from visiting the Parchin nuclear site, to the south of Tehran, where suspected military capability was being developed. Clearly, the refusal to allow IAEA delegates from entering the Parchin site would do nothing to alleviate suspicions about Iran's military nuclear ambitions.

Moreover, leaked elements from the IAEA report noted that Iran increased the number of centrifuges used to enrich uranium and intensified the  production of uranium enriched to the higher level of 20 percent. Leaked information from that report also indicated that Iran stepped up its uranium enrichment at main nuclear plant at Natanz, as well as at the underground site of Fordo.  It should be noted that the Fordo plant, which is constructed under a mountain, would be almost impossible to damage in a potential military strike by Israel or the United States.

Accordingly, the IAEA declared the following: ""As Iran is not providing the necessary co-operation... the agency is unable to provide credible assurance about the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran. The agency continues to have serious concerns regarding possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear program.""

Overall, the findings from the IAEA would likely serve only to underline existing suspicions by the West that Iran held ambitions to build a nuclear bomb.

For its part, Iran insisted that the country was, in fact, cooperating with the IAEA, while simultaneously defending Iran's right to a nuclear development program.  Iran was also insisting -- as before -- that it was not pursuing a nuclear weapon.  Speaking at the international Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi argued, ""We do not see any glory, pride or power in the nuclear weapons -- quite the opposite... The production, possession, use, or threat of use of nuclear weapons is illegitimate, futile, harmful, dangerous and prohibited as a great sin.""  On the other side of the equation, the United States envoy at the conference, Laura  Kennedy, responded saying Iran's expressed commitment to peaceful nuclear development stood ""in sharp contrast""  to its failure to comply with international obligations.

Editor's Update:

As February 2012 drew to an end, the six parties involved in nuclear negotiations with Iran -- the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia, and China -- appeared to be ready to resume talks with Tehran.  The talks stalled more than a year earlier and the return to the negotiating table was not being regarded with serious optimism.  That being said, even without high hopes for a breakthrough, all six countries agreed that all peaceful avenues should be explored, in order to minimize the possibility of a new conflict in the Middle East.

In an interview with The Atlantic magazine published  at the start of March 2012, President Obama issued a double warning -- to Iran and to Israel respectively.  He said that he was not bluffing about a possible attack on Iran,  if it builds a nuclear weapon, while also cautioning Israel that a premature attack on Iran would be more harmful than helpful to global security.As stated by the United States leader: ""I think that the Israeli government recognizes that, as president of the United States, I don't bluff. I also don't, as a matter of sound policy, go around advertising exactly what our intentions are. But (both) governments recognize that when the United States says it is unacceptable for Iran to have a nuclear weapon, we mean what we say.""

For his part, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seemed  impatient about the path of diplomacy and sanctions, and emphasized his country's right to defend itself -- presumably in the form of targeted strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities.  He said,  ""Israel must reserve the right to defend itself, and after all, that's the very purpose of the Jewish state: to restore to the Jewish people control over our destiny.""

On March 5, 2012, in response to accusations by Republican rivals that he would allow Iran to become armed with nuclear bombs, United States President Obama cautioned against the rush the war.  Addressing the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) lobbying group, the American president disparaged Republicans' pro-war [on Iran] rhetoric saying, ""Already, there is too much loose talk of war."" He continued, ""Over the last few weeks, such talk has only benefited the Iranian government, by driving up the price of oil, which they depend on to fund their nuclear program. For the sake of Israel's security, America's security, and the peace and security of the world, now is not the time for bluster.""  Outlining his own ""soft power with a sharp edge"" foreign policy, President Obama said, ""Now is the time to let our increased pressure sink in, and to sustain the broad international coalition we have built. Now is the time to heed the timeless advice from Teddy Roosevelt -- speak softly; carry a big stick.""

A day later at a press conference, President Obama made clear that his stance regarding Iran's nuclear program was not one of containment but rather one of prevention.  He said, ""We will not countenance Iran getting a nuclear weapon,"" the president told reporters. At the same time, the president was not willing to abandon the diplomatic track saying,  ""At this stage, it is my belief that we have a window of opportunity that this still can be resolved diplomatically.""

On March 8, 2012,  Iran's Ayatollah Khamenei appeared to welcome President Obama's observation that the ""window"" for diplomacy remained open.  Iran's supreme leader characterized the American president's statement as follows: ""These words are good words and are a sign of no longer being in delusion.""  Still, Khamenei criticized the sanctions regime being levied against Iran.  The White House was undeterred from its path. White House Press Secretary  Jay Carney said, ""The president's policy towards Iran is focused in a very clear-eyed way on behavior rather than rhetoric... The pressure on Iran will continue. The ratcheting up of sanctions will continue.""

It should also be noted that only a day before, a report by the Associated Press appeared to indicate that Iran was trying to clean up radioactive traces in the aftermath of possible tests of a nuclear weapons trigger. The report displayed satellite images of an Iranian military facility, with trucks and other vehicles at the site, quite possibly engaged in such clean up or sanitization activities. There were also references to claims by diplomats that crews at the Parchin military site could be trying to erase evidence of tests of an experimental neutron device used to set off nuclear explosions.  Of course, a  neutron initiator would only be used in the development of  nuclear arms. At the same time, it was possible that radioactive traces could also be left by material other than a neutron initiator -- for example, uranium metal used as  a substitute for testing purposes.

These findings came to light even as Iran indicated it would allow international inspectors to visit a key military base in Parchin, which the IAEA believes may be involved in a nuclear weapons program. The pictures could plausibly boost the theory that the Iranians were trying to hide evidence of their nuclear progam in anticipation of that visit.

Note that in late March 2012, nuclear politics were at the forefront of the international purview when world leaders gathered at the Nuclear Security Summit.

There, United States President Barack Obama reiterated his call for  ""a world without nuclear weapons"" and advanced his foreign policy agenda that advocates  non-proliferation and the reduction of  nuclear weapons through increased diplomacy.

In a speech to students at Hankuk University, President Obama said that the United States -- the only nation to have ever used nuclear weapons -- was fully committed to  reducing its stockpile of nuclear arms.  President Obama also drew thunderous applause from the audience of students when he said that, as a father, he did not wish to see his daughters growing up in a world with nuclear threats. President Obama acknowledged his country's unique position in the world, but he noted that ""serious sustained global effort"" was needed to achieve his expressed hope for a nuclear weapons-free world.

The issue of nuclear proliferation has been at the forefront of the international purview given the ongoing concerns about North Korea's nuclear arsenal as well as Iran's nuclear ambitions.  To that latter end, President Obama was expected to meet with Russia's outgoing President Dmitry Medvedev on the matter of Iran's nuclear program -- an issue that has not always seen progress due to divisions among countries with veto power on the United Nations Security Council. With an eye on working cooperatively with such countries, President Obama pledged to work with Russia and China at reducing the risk of nuclear terrorism.

President Obama addressed the issue of Iran's controversial nuclear development program, saying that time remained to resolve the deadlock through diplomacy.  ""But time is short,"" said President Obama. ""Iran must act with the seriousness and sense of urgency that this moment demands,"" he continued.

For its part, Iran has insisted that it has the right to develop nuclear development for peaceful civilian purposes.  On the other side of the equation, the West has asserted that Iran is seeking  to build nuclear weapons via its clandestine nuclear arms development program.  While Iran has been subject to sanctions as a result of its failure to fulfill its international obligations, international concurrence has not come easily due to objections from China and Russia.  However, President Obama was making it clear that he intended to work with these two countries as he stated: ""Today, I'll meet with the leaders of Russia and China as we work to achieve a resolution in which Iran fulfills its obligations.""

As March 2012 drew to a close, President Obama was clearing the way to tighten sanctions against Iran.  Suggesting that there was enough oil on the world market to  allow countries to withstand the loss of some Iranian oil, President Obama moved to ramp up sanctions against Iran that would penalize foreign entities that purchase oil from Iran's central bank, which collects payment for most of the country's energy exports. This move was intended to pressure Iran to halt its nuclear program.In  April 2012, global concerns over the prospects of Iran developing a nuclear weapon tamped down to some degree.  At issue was a claim by the head of the Israeli military that  Iran was not yet committed to the path of developing nuclear weapons.  In an interview with the Israeli newspaper, Haaretz, Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Benny Gantz said he did not believe Iran would necessarily develop nuclear weapons. He said Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, had not yet made a final decision whether to build a nuclear bomb.

While Gantz acknowledged that Iran was moving ""step by step to the place where it will be able to decide whether to manufacture a nuclear bomb,"" he expressed the view that the Iranian regime ""hasn't yet decided to go the extra mile."" Gantz additionally said the following of Ayatollah Khamenei and the Iranian power brokers: ""I don't think he will want to go the extra mile. I think the Iranian leadership is composed of very rational people.""  But Gantz also warned that a decision of some sort in the offing. He said, ""Either Iran takes its nuclear program to a civilian footing only, or the world -- perhaps we too -- will have to do something. We're closer to the end of discussions than the middle.""

This tempered view was a far cry from the rhetoric to date that Iran has been intent on a plan to develop weapons as part of its nuclear technology program.  Those fears by leading members of the international community have only been accentuated by Iran's failure to abide by international agreements regarding the monitoring of its nuclear development activities.  Indeed, in late 2011, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) published a report which noted the fact that it was unable to ""provide credible assurance about the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran."" The IAEA report also warned that  it continued to have ""serious concerns regarding possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear program.""

More recently in February 2012, the IAEA concluded that Iran was not cooperative and that prevailing questions regarding the possible military dimension of the Iranian nuclear development program remained unanswered. Of particular concern was the fact that  the IAEA was prohibited by the Iranian authorities from visiting the Parchin nuclear site, to the south of Tehran, where suspected military capability was being developed. Clearly, the refusal to allow IAEA delegates from entering the Parchin site would do nothing to alleviate suspicions about Iran's military nuclear ambitions. Moreover, leaked elements from the IAEA report noted that Iran increased the number of centrifuges used to enrich uranium and intensified the  production of uranium enriched to the higher level of 20 percent. Leaked information from that report also indicated that Iran stepped up its uranium enrichment at main nuclear plant at Natanz, as well as at the underground site of Fordo.  It should be noted that the Fordo plant, which is constructed under a mountain, would be almost impossible to damage in a potential military strike by Israel or the United States.

Accordingly, the IAEA declared the following: ""As Iran is not providing the necessary co-operation... the agency is unable to provide credible assurance about the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran. The agency continues to have serious concerns regarding possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear program."" Overall, the findings from the IAEA would likely serve only to underline existing suspicions by the West that Iran held ambitions to build a nuclear bomb.

To date, Iran's continued non-compliance with nuclear monitoring has led to the imposition of sanctions by the United Nations, as well as by individual countries including the United States,  Canada, Japan, Australia, as well as the European Union. For his part,  Israeli military chief Gantz  appeared to be of the mind that international pressure was yielding results.

Still, not everyone in Israel was of the same view.  In an interview with CNN, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  said that he would not want to bet ""the security of the world on Iran's rational behavior.""  Moreover, Netanyahu made it clear that he was willing  to take action against Iran to stop it obtaining a nuclear weapon.  That being said, the nuanced differences between the words of Gantz and Netanyahu highlighted a growing divide in Israel between political leaders and military/intelligence specialists over the wisdom of attacking Iran.  As such, the overall political and diplomatic climate had cooled from its previous level of heated turmoil.

It should be noted that around the same period (late April 2012), Iran made it clear that it would be returning to the negotiating table  for a new round of talks with the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency, the IAEA. Talks were set for May 13-14, 2012, in Austria.  Tehran said that its  decision to resume talks with the IAEA ""shows the peaceful nature of all of its nuclear activities, while showing that claims against Iran are baseless."" A second round of talks  involving the so-called ""six powers"" of the United States, China, Russia, Britain, France and Germany was scheduled to take place in Iraq; a first round had already occurred in April 2012 in Turkey.In late May 2012, six world powers met in Iraq to discuss Iran's controversial nuclear program and agreed to continue talks in Russia a month later.  At issue was the status of nuclear negotiations between Iran and the six party group composed of  the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia, and China.  The discussions were aimed at finding an agreement in which Iran would abandon its medium-level uranium enrichment program, while holding onto its peaceful nuclear program and reversing some of the damage yielded by international sanctions.

Iran's desire to end those crippling sanctions, in combination with the West's desire to see Iran end its nuclear development program, together created a political climate where negotiations were again attractive.  Of course, there was only limited optimism that such talks would actually yield constructive results; however, there was enough of an incentive for all sides to re-enter the negotiating arena.  Stated differently, even without high hopes for a breakthrough, the six countries agreed that all peaceful avenues should be explored, in order to minimize the possibility of a new conflict in the Middle East. .

During these talks in Iraq,  sources from the European Union said that although ""significant differences"" remained, there had been progress in forging common ground. The six world powers were reportedly  offering Iran a deal aimed curbing uranium enrichment and allowing IAEA inspectors ""in country"" to verify that Iran's nuclear activity was indeed for peaceful purposes.  The deal would include medical isotopes and co-operation on nuclear safety in exchange for the cessation of Iran's medium-enriched (20 percent) uranium enrichment program. Of course, even in the face of this offer, Iran was maintaining  its right to uranium enrichment.  Still, Iran was clearly seeking to end the international sanctions campaign -- led by the Obama administration in the United States -- which has badly damaged the Iranian economy.  While there was no immediate breakthrough, there was enough movement to necessitate scheduling further talks in mid-June 2012 in the Russian capital of Moscow.

At the start of June 2012, satellite imagery emerged  showing  the destruction of buildings and removal of soil  at the  Parchin military site in Iran -- a venue intended for monitoring by the United Nationsnuclear watchdog agency. The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) posted the imagery on its website and came in the aftermath of a meeting between the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  and Western diplomats regarding the possibility of a nuclear clean-up effort at Parchin.  At a news conference, IAEA head, Yukio Amano, said: ""The satellite imagery indicates that these activities include the use of water, demolishing of buildings, removing fences and moving soil.""  He expressed concern that such activities would negatively affect the IAEA's efforts to investigate the Parchin site.

The reports of Iran  trying to clean up radioactive traces appeared to be reinforced by satellite imagery showing the destruction of buildings and removal of soil at Parchin. The revelations of apparent ""sanitization"" would likely reinforce doubts by the West that Iran has been acting in good faith as regards its nuclear program.  They would also situate the Parchin military site at the core of the argument. Iran has insisted that Parchin is a conventional military complex; however, the West has argued that it is the site of experiments, possibly aimed at developing nuclear bombs.

These developments occurred ahead of a new round of nuclear talks between the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency, the IAEA, and Iran. These talks were intended to advance the development of a framework for cooperation with Iran, which Iranian authorities have said would be needed before allowing inspectors from the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency to visit Parchin.  But on June 8, 2012, the IAEA said that negotiations in Austria ended without progress having been made.  IAEA chief inspector Herman Nackaerts said the lack of progress at the talks in Vienna was ""disappointing."" Iran's ambassador to the IAEA Ali Ashghar Soltanieh, offered a more sanguine view saying: ""We are ready to remove all ambiguities and prove to the world that our activities are exclusively for peaceful purposes and none of these allegations [of developing a nuclear bomb] are true.""  Of course, such declarations were unlikely to assuage the IAEA and the West, which would be more apt to view Iran's actions as illustrative of a country failing to act in good faith.

Meanwhile, a separate set of negotiations were being held with the participation of  Iran and the so-called six powers --  the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia, and China. The six world powers were reportedly  offering Iran a deal aimed curbing uranium enrichment and allowing IAEA inspectors ""in country"" to verify that Iran's nuclear activity was indeed for peaceful purposes.  The deal would include medical isotopes and co-operation on nuclear safety in exchange for the cessation of Iran's medium-enriched (20 percent) uranium enrichment program and Iran relinquishing its  stockpile of enriched uranium.

The first round of negotiations between Iran and the six powers  was held in May 2012.  During those May 2012 negotiations, sources from the European Union said that although ""significant differences"" remained, there had been progress in forging common ground.  Even in the face of this offer, Iran maintained  its right to uranium enrichment.  Still, Iran was clearly seeking to end the international sanctions campaign -- led by the Obama administration in the United States -- which has badly damaged the Iranian economy.  While there was no immediate breakthrough, there was enough movement to necessitate scheduling further talks. Further negotiations were due to be held in the Russian capital of Moscow later in June 2012.

While talks to date have not yielded concrete results, Iran's desire to end the campaign of  crippling international sanctions, in combination with the West's desire to see Iran end its nuclear development program, together created a political climate where negotiations could be attractive to all vested interests.

On June 18, 2012, after the most recent round of talks on Iran's nuclear program ended in the Russian capital city of Moscow without progress being made.  According to Russian negotiators, the talks yielded no breakthrough since the differences between Iran and the six world powers remained irreconcilable. As reported by the Russian news agency, Interfax, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said: ""The main stumbling block is that the sides' positions are rather difficult and tough to reconcile.""

According to Michael Mann, a spokesperson for the world powers, the discussions began in a positive manner with high hopes that Iran would seriously consider the proposals discussed above.  But as before, Iran was demanding that the West lift its sanctions and that its ""non-negotiable"" right to enrich uranium  be recognized.

Meanwhile, amidst the various rounds of negotiations, June 2012 saw the New York Times feature an excerpt of the book, ""Confront and Conceal: Obama's Secret Wars and Surprising Use of American Power,"" by David Sanger, which detailed the United States' cyber war against Iran. Cyber war was the ""smart power"" option available to the United States and its allies in preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons, in contrast to the ""soft power"" option of sanctions or the ""hard power"" alternatives such as military strikes.

The alleged cyber war against Iran dated back to the previous Bush administration in the United States, with the help of Israel, in developing an effort  code-named Olympic Games.  Under the succeeding Obama administration that cyber war program was preserved and even accelerated.  Indeed,  Sanger's book, which was based on anonymous American, European, and Israeli expert sources, suggested that the United States was being pushed into new and uncharted territory. As noted by Sanger, the cyber war program was credited with ""achieving, with computer code, what until then could be accomplished only by bombing a country or sending in agents to plant explosives.""

The computer worm project was actually implanted in a clandestine manner using  undercover intelligence agents.  It was intended to cause damage to Iranian centrifuges and reportedly accomplished that goal. However, President Obama ordered more sophisticated computer attacks on Iran's main nuclear enrichment facilities in an expanded program of cyber war -- even after aspects of the program, known as the Stuxnet computer virus, were accidentally leaked into the public purview in mid-2010 as a result of a programming error.  Experts surmised that the cyber war program  set back Iran's nuclear program up to two years.  That being said, some sources suggest that Iran's enrichment levels are recovering, and thus could leave Iran with enough resources to yet develop nuclear weapons.  Of course, the question remains an open one as to whether or not Iran is actively pursuing this path.  Tehran's continued intransigence in cooperating with the IAEA has done little to assuage the doubts of the West.

Special Note: Bulgarian bombing; Israel blames Iran and Hezbollah

On July 18, 2012, eight people died and more than 30 others were injured when a bomb exploded at the Burgas airport in Bulgaria.  The victims included the Bulgarian bus driver and the suspected suicide bomber who carried out the attack. The bombing appeared to target a bus carrying Israeli tourists in the Black Sea region of Bulgaria. Significantly, the attack occurred on the 18th anniversary of a deadly attack on a Jewish community center in Argentina, raising the likelihood that the Bulgaria bombing was another instance of anti-Jewish terrorism by extremist elements. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wasted little time in blaming Iran for the act of terrorism in a statement that read: ""All the signs lead to Iran. Only in the past few months we have seen Iranian attempts to attack Israelis in Thailand, India, Georgia, Kenya, Cyprus and other places."" He additionally promised retaliation, asserting in the statement, ""Murderous Iranian terror continues to hit innocent people. This is an Iranian terror attack that is spreading throughout the entire world. Israel will react forcefully to Iranian terror."" A day later, Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak expanded on Netanyahu's claim that Iran was behind the act of terrorism, explaining that the Lebanese Hezbollah was the direct perpetrator of the attack, but had been acting under the aegis  of Iran.  Netanyahu himself explained the connection using the following phrase: ""Hezbollah, the long arm of Iran."" Analysts were suggesting that the terror attack in Bulgaria was likely another manifestation of the covert  war between Israel and Iran.  To that end, there were intimations that the Bulgaria bombing might have been a retaliatory attack for the series of targeted strikes against  Iranian nuclear scientists. For its part, Iran dismissed the accusation and expressed condemnation for ""all terrorist acts.""  No statement, though, came from Hezbollah. By July 20, 2012, United States officials were suggesting that the suicide bomber on the bus in Bulgaria was a member of Hezbollah.  According to the New York Times,  their sources did not wish to be identified as the investigation was under way, however, the suicide bomber was in Bulgaria on a mission to attack Israeli interests. The New York Times' unnamed sources also observed that Hezbollah was being guided and sponsored by Iran in this effort. Bulgarian Interior Minister Tsvetan Tsvetanov was on the record confirming that the suicide bomber had been ""in country"" for several days prior to the terror attack. Could Iran's upgraded ballistic missile and increased nuclear development spur an Israeli strike?  On Aug. 21, 2012, Iran unveiled an upgraded version of a short range surface-to-surface ballistic missile.  Known as the Fateh-110, or Conqueror, it was intended to showcase Iran's military deterrence capabilities, according to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.  The new ballistic missile reportedly enjoyed a more rapid  launch time, greater longevity, and could be deployed during inclement weather conditions.  During the unveiling ceremony for the Fateh-110, President Ahmadinejad said: ""We do not seek progress in the defense industry for conquest. We want it to defend ourselves, our territory, our existence. Secondly, we want it for defending human dignity.""  The development in Iran would, no doubt, fuel speculation about Iran's controversial nuclear development program, its progress therein, and Israel's potential reaction to militarily thwart Iran's nuclear development.  The conventional wisdom as of August 2012 was that Israel was seriously considering such action, although no final decision had yet been made.  It was yet to be seen if the news of the new ballistic missile would influence Israeli powers as to their plan of action.  It should be noted the surface-to-surface Fateh-110 ballistic missile was not believed to possess the capability to launch a nuclear weapon, and thus was not to be regarded as part of the Iranian nuclear threat.  Specifically, as reported by BBC News, Iranian ballistic missiles were not believed to be large enough for conveying conventional weapons and lacked the accuracy to hit targets with precision or reliability.  That being said, by the end of the month, the Iranian nuclear threat resurfaced with International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) report that Iran had doubled its nuclear development capacity at the Fordo nuclear site. According to the IAEA, there were now more than double the number of enrichment centrifuges at Fordo although new equipment was not yet functional.  The IAEA also said that Iran had ""significantly hampered"" its ability to inspect the Parchin military site, which the nuclear watchdog agency said had been ""sanitized,"" presumably to obfuscate Iranian nuclear activities.  Undoubtedly, this collective news would concern Israel, raising the specter of an Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear facilities.  Of significance was the fact that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was set to address the United Nations General Assembly in September 2012 on the dangers of Iran's nuclear program.

Israeli PM wants ""red line"" on Iran over nuclear threat; Iran threatens retaliation for possible attack  As September 2012 began, the Iranian nuclear threat resurfaced with International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) report that Iran had doubled its nuclear development capacity at the Fordo nuclear site. According to the IAEA, there were now more than double the number of enrichment centrifuges at Fordo although new equipment was not yet functional.  The IAEA also said that Iran had ""significantly hampered"" its ability to inspect the Parchin military site, which the nuclear watchdog agency said had been ""sanitized,"" presumably to obfuscate Iranian nuclear activities.  Undoubtedly, this collective news would concern Israel, raising the specter of an Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear facilities.  Of significance was the fact that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was set to address the United Nations General Assembly in September 2012 on the dangers of Iran's nuclear program.  With that gathering of the United Nations General Assembly in New York in the offing, Israeli Prime Minister attempted to schedule a meeting with United States President Barack Obama. Media reports indicated that Netanyahu said that he was prepared to travel to Washington D.C. to meet with President Obama.  The White House declined the meeting on the basis of the United States' leader schedule; it also drew attention to the fact that there were no bilateral meetings scheduled for the United States president with any other leaders.  The White House also pointed to a meeting between Prime Minister Netanyahu with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton .  The White House further noted that there was ongoing contact between President Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu over a number of security issues, including the nuclear threat posed by Iran. In  statement, the  White House confirmed that President Obama had just spoken with President Netanyahu for an hour on Sept. 11, 2012.  The statement included the following assertions: ""The two leaders discussed the threat posed by Iran's nuclear program, and our close cooperation on Iran and other security issues. President Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu reaffirmed that they are united in their determination to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, and agreed to continue their close consultations going forward.""  Nevertheless, Netanyahu's inability to secure a meeting with President Obama fueled speculation about poor relations between the two men.  It was certainly possible that the White House was not in the mood to reward Netanyahu after he criticized the United States for not being tough enough on Iran over its nuclear program.  During  a news conference in Jerusalem with  Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov,  Netanyahu spoke of of the international community's reluctance to sanction a military strike against Iran's nuclear facilities.  He said, ""The world tells Israel: wait, there's still time. And I say: wait for what? Wait until when?"" He continued, ""Those in the international community who refuse to put red lines before Iran don't have a moral right to place a red light before Israel.""  Prime Minister Netanyahu went on to characterize  Iran as ""the greatest threat to world peace.""  The level of rhetoric from the Israeli leader was so high that the Haaretz newspaper described Netanyahu's remarks as ""an unprecedented verbal attack on the United States government.""  By the close of September 2012, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu had addressed the United Nations General Assembly and declared that time was running out to halt Iran's push to acquire enough enriched uranium to develop a nuclear bomb.  Using a crude visual and a red pen, Netanyahu again reiterated his demand that there be a ""red line"" draw as regards the Iranian nuclear threat.Prime Minister Netanyahu charged that Iran might have sufficient material to create a nuclear bomb by the middle of 2013, thus requiring a clear message from the international community in the form of the ""red line.""  Netanyahu said, ""Red lines don't lead to war, red lines prevent war. Nothing could imperil the world more than a nuclear-armed Iran.""  He also dismissed the effectiveness of sanctions passed against Iran, saying that they had not curtailed Iran's nuclear program and asserting that ""The Iranian nuclear calendar does not take time out.""It should be noted that the United States has generally taken the view that an aggressive sanctions regime was the best path to placing pressure on Iran to end its nuclear development program.  As well, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton seemed to dismiss Netanyahu's call, saying instead that her country was not prepared to commit to drawing ""red lines.""  In his own address to the United Nations General Assembly, President Barack Obama asserted that his country  would ""do what we must"" to stop Tehran acquiring nuclear arms.""  But he also made it clear that while the United States has not foreclosed a military option against Iran, multinational negotiations and sanctions should be given time to work.For its part, Iran responded  to the Israeli prime minister's address by warning that it had the right to retaliate to any military strike on its territory or interests.  Iran's deputy United Nations ambassador also said that his county possessed enough military might to defend itself and that it was not seeing nuclear weapons capability in the first place.  Eshagh al-Habib said his country was ""strong enough to defend itself and reserves its full right to retaliate with full force against any attack.""That being said, Iran's often-repeated claim that it had the right to a civilian nuclear program was itself subject to serious challenge. In mid-September 2012, the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), issued a stern rebuke of Iran's refusal to suspend uranium enrichment. Notably, the IAEA's resolution was proposed jointly by the United States, China, Russia, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom in a rare display of unity as regards the Iranian nuclear development issue. Meanwhile, IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano noted that despite a series of meetings with Iran throughout 2012 aimed at ensuring that the IAEA would be able to carry out its investigations, there had been no concrete results.  Amano characterized the lack of progress  as ""frustrating.""

Bilateral Talks with the United States?  

On Oct. 21, 2012, the New York Times reported that Iran had agreed to bilateral negotiations with the United States over its controversial nuclear development program. The New York Times, in its report, suggested that the talks might be held after the November 2012 general elections in the United States. But shortly after this news item broke in the public sphere, the Obama White House was denying key aspects of these claims, asserting instead that while it was, in principle, prepared to meet with Iran bilaterally, there was actually no such plan afoot.Tommy Vietor, a spokesperson for the United States National Security Council, offered the following statement: ""It's not true that the United States and Iran have agreed to one-on-one talks or any meeting after the American elections."" He continued: ""We continue to work... on a diplomatic solution and have said from the outset that we would be prepared to meet bilaterally."" Vietor reiterated the Obama administration's stance, saying: ""The president has made clear that he will prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and we will do what we must to achieve that. The onus is on the Iranians to do so, otherwise they will continue to face crippling sanctions and increased pressure.""This latter statement referred to the ongoing approach to dealing with Iran. With an eye on pressuring Iran, the United States, countries of the European Union, and other Western nation states have levied harsh sanctions on that country.Meanwhile, in the period of early November 2012, possible goodwill between the two sides was likely strained when Iranian fighter jets shot at an unmanned United States drone carrying out routine surveillance mission over international waters. According to the Pentagon, two Iranian jets intercepted the Predator drone and fired ""multiple rounds"" in its direction. The Pentagon also made it clear that the drone was over international waters and never in Iranian air space. That being said, the shots from the Iranian jets ended in futility as the drone was guided back to base successfully. The Pentagon noted that the United States was undeterred from its intent to continue surveillance in the area. Speaking on behalf of the Pentagon, spokesperson George Little said: ""The United States has communicated to the Iranians that we will continue to conduct surveillance flights over international waters over the Arabian Gulf.""Is Iran suspending or increasing uranium enrichment?With an eye on pressuring Iran, the United States, countries of the European Union, and other Western nation states have levied harsh sanctions on that country. The United States, in particular, has taken the view that an aggressive sanctions regime was the best path to placing pressure on Iran to end its nuclear development program. While United States President Barack Obama has not foreclosed the option of a military strike (either by the United States or Israel) on Iran's nuclear facilities, and he has made his determination to stop Iran from building a nuclear bomb clear, he has also been emphatic that the harsh sanctions regime be given a chance to work. In a September 2012 address to the United Nations General Assembly, President Barack Obama asserted that his country would ""do what we must"" to stop Tehran acquiring nuclear arms."" But he also said that multinational negotiations and sanctions should be given time to work.To that end, Iran was certainly suffering as a result of the crippling sanctions that included restrictions on banking, shipping, trade, insurance, as well as commodities and energy transactions. Together they have struck a blow on Iran's commercial ties to the outside world. One area of sanctions that has seen notable success has been the exhaustive ban by SWIFT -- an international financial clearinghouse -- which prohibits the transfer of Iranian funds. The SWIFT ban has affected access by ordinary Iranians to basic food items. At the same time, Iranians were being subject to inflated prices of cooking oil and other staples, as well as a precipitous decline of Iran's national currency, which itself led to domestic unrest. Meanwhile, customs data from around the world showed that Iranian oil exports and oil revenues had sharply decreased. The question, of course, was whether or not the burgeoning decimation  of the Iranian economy would actually affect Tehran's behavior on the nuclear issue.A possible indication of the answer to that latter question came on Nov. 3, 2102, when the British-based Guardian newspaper reported that Iran suspended its 20 percent uranium enrichment levels as a goodwill gesture ahead of possible talks with the United States. Higher levels of uranium enrichment was a precursor to weapons-grade uranium. The Guardian cited a report on the Al Arabiya website, which quoted Mohammad Hossein Asfari, a Iranian member of parliament, expressing hope that damaging sanctions would be lifted in return for this move. The report seemed to be on something of a collision course with a recent revelation that Iran had recently finished installing centrifuges for enriching uranium at its underground nuclear facility in Fordo. It should be noted that the Guardian soon published a clarification of its original story, noting that Asfari was misquoted and that Iran had, in fact, not already halted 20 percent uranium enrichment. Instead, Asfari was indicating Iran's willingness to stop enrichment at these higher levels if sanctions were lifted.In President Obama's first news conference after winning re-election on Nov. 14, 2012, he dismissed the reports of talks with Iran, saying they were simply ""not true.""In mid-2012, the very notion of a possible suspension of uranium enrichment by Iran was utterly blown away. A leaked report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) indicated that Iran was ready to double output at its Fordo underground uranium enrichment facility. According to the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency, Iran could soon double the number of its operational centrifuges from 700 to 1,400. Inspectors from the IAEA who have monitored the Fordo facility, which is buried in a mountain close to the holy city of Qom, have noted that while the uranium enrichment plant was not fully operational, it could well be ready in the space of only months. Moreover, increased production of 20 percent medium-enriched uranium would be possible. Medium enriched uranium (at 20 percent levels) can be used for conversion into fuel for Iran's medical research reactor; however, highly-enriched uranium at the 90 percent level would be needed for the development of nuclear weapons.The main question for the IAEA -- and the global community -- involved the matter of how easy (or difficult ) it would be for Iran to increase its uranium enrichment activities in a manner that would allow for the development of a nuclear bomb. Further, what kind of timeline was at stake in achieving this end?It should also be noted that this leaked report by the IAEA also indicated that ""extensive activities"" at the Parchin military site had ensued. The nuclear watchdog agency warned that Iran may have been trying to hide evidence of some sort of nuclear weapons experimentation. Accordingly, the IAEA concluded that it was ""unable... to conclude that all nuclear material in Iran [was being used for] peaceful activities.""Special Report on Iran's Nuclear Program (as of Feb. 2013)On Feb. 6, 2013, the United States tightened its financial sanctions against Iran, making it more difficult for that country to spend oil revenue.  Iran has already been subject to harsh international sanctions due to its controversial nuclear development program, its clandestine nuclear development activities, and its lack of cooperation with nuclear inspectors at the International Atomic Energy Agency.  It has additionally been subject to unilateral financial sanctions by the United States and other Western countries, in an effort to place pressure on Iran to relinquish its nuclear program, which most international powers believe is not intended for peaceful purposes but oriented towards nuclear weaponization.  Existing financial sanctions were already having an effect on Iran's economy, making it difficult to procure basic goods, such as cooking oil and medical supplies,  creating huge obstacles for Iran to do business with other countries, and contributing to a precipitous decline in the value of the Iranian currency, the rial.

On Feb. 7, 2013, Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei rebuffed the notion of direct talks with the United States during an address that was published on the Internet.  With an apparent reference to United States Vice President Joe Biden's suggestion of direct bilateral talks, followed by the tightening of sanctions, Khamenei said the United States was giving the appearance of being open to negotiations while simultaneously  ""pointing a gun at Iran.""  He further asserted that talks with the United States ""would solve nothing.""  At issue were upcoming multilateral talks on Iran's nuclear program.   Biden was suggesting parallel bilateral talks, saying that his country was prepared to hold direct negotiations with Iran ""when the Iranian leadership, supreme leader, is serious.""  He continued, ""That offer stands, but it must be real and tangible and there has to be an agenda that they are prepared to speak to. We are not just prepared to do it for the exercise."" Of course, on Feb. 7, 2013,  with Khamenei's reaction on the record, it was apparent that the notion of bilateral talks was just an exercise in theory.

In the face of these developments, Iran continued to assert that its nuclear development program did not have a weapons dimension.    

On Feb. 16, 2013,  Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei, insisted that his country was not developing nuclear weapons.  He also said that his preference would be the prohibition of nuclear weapons across the world.  Still, Khamenei foreclosed the notion of global pressure on Iran and made it clear that if Iran wanted to manufacture a nuclear bomb, no other country would be able to stop the process.  He said: ""We believe that nuclear weapons must be obliterated, and we do not intend to make nuclear weapons, but if we had not had this belief and had decided to possess nuclear weapons, no power could have ever been able to stop us.""

With a presidential election scheduled to be held in June 2013, there was no likelihood that the Iranian authorities would give way to the will of the international community.  In fact, outgoing President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad gave voice to the domestic political climate in Iran when he said in a national address on state television: ""On behalf of the Iranian nation, I say that whoever thinks that the Iranian nation would surrender to pressure is making a huge mistake and will take his wish to the grave.""

Meanwhile, talks in mid-February 2013 involving United Nations inspectors  yielded no progress.  Inspectors from the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency, the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), had traveled to Iran to try to reach an agreement aimed at allowing inspectors back into the country to continue their investigation into Iran's suspected nuclear weapons program.  Of particular concern to IAEA inspectors has been the Parchin military base where explosives tests related to nuclear weaponry were suspected to have taken place.  There were prevailing suspicions that Iran had  ""sanitized"" the site to conceal evidence of clandestine activities. That being said, IAEA inspectors attempting to reinvigorate the  nuclear investigation characterized their efforts with the Iranians as wholly unproductive.  In a news conference, the chief United Nations inspector, Herman Nackaerts, said that he and his colleagues ""could not finalize the document"" aimed at resuming the inquiry, and that no new date had been set for further negotiations.

There was an emerging sense -- even from the West -- that the door was closing on a peaceful resolution to the challenge of the Iranian nuclear issue. According to a report by Reuters News,   a Western diplomat accredited to the IAEA was on the record saying: ""Despite its many commitments to do so, Iran has not negotiated in good faith. It appears that we now have to ask ourselves if this is still the right tactic.""

The expressed admission  by an IAEA-aligned diplomat of the failure of the negotiations progress meant that non-military options were quickly dissipating.  Without progress on the diplomatic front, and with Iran in a stalemate with the international community,  the specter of military action loomed large.  Israel has made it clear that it was willing to  use force, if necessary, to prevent Iran from developing its suspected nuclear weapons program.

It should be noted that Iran has done little to reduce the anxiety of the Western world.  First, the IAEA had already made it clear that engagement with Iran  yielded absolutely no progress and that concerns related to Iran's nuclear program remained in tact.  Second,  Iran had denied IAEA inspectors from visiting the aforementioned Parchin site.

The case against Iran was further bolstered by the news that IAEA inspectors identified  new centrifuges at  Natanz -- Iran's main enrichment plant.  As reported by Reuters News on Feb. 21, 2013,  Iran  was now  installing advanced machines to refine uranium -- a development that could potentially accelerate the  accumulation of materials used to develop a nuclear weapon.

The  new model of centrifuges, known as the IR2m, was able to enrich  uranium at rates two or three times faster than prior levels  to date.  Although the new model of centrifuges were not yet believed to be fully functional, Iran was already expanding its stockpile of higher grade uranium,  moving gradually closer to the so-called ""red line"" identified by Israel as its final grounds for taking military action.

In a bit of encouraging news,  the IAEA also reported that Iran resumed converting some of its 20 percent concentration uranium  for use as reactor fuel in late 2012.  That usage likely curtailed Iran's ability to develop a  higher-grade uranium stockpile.  It was  possible that this information could cause Israel to delay military action against Iranian nuclear facilities.  Nevertheless, in the third week of February 2013,  Israel's Ambassador to the United States Micheal Oren reiterated his country's position that if no progress was made in the effort to stop Iran's nuclear development program, there was a high likelihood of a military gesture by mid-2013.  Oren made these remarks during an interview on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" television show.

For its part, the Obama administration in the United States wasted no time in condemning Iran  over the installation of the IR2m centrifuges at the main uranium enrichment plant of Natanz.  As stated by United States Department of State spokesperson Victoria Nuland: ""The installation of new advanced centrifuges would be a further escalation and a continuing violation of Iran's (U.N.) obligations. It would mark yet another provocative step.""

At  the end of February 2013, Iran  attended multilateral talks in Kazakhstan with the  so-called P5+1 group -- the  United Nations Security Council permanent members of China, Russia, France, the United Kingdom,  and the United States, plus plus Germany. According to Reuters News,  Vincent Floreani, a spokesperson for France's Foreign Ministry, said the P5+1 countries were prepared to table a new offer for Iran, which could change the trajectory of the negotiations to date .  He said, ""We will make a new offer that will have significant new elements. The approach ... is to begin gradually with confidence-building measures. We want a real exchange that will lead to concrete results.""  For its part, Iran was claiming that it looked forward to these talks.  Iran's United Nations Ambassador Mohammad Khazaei said: ""As the representative of the Islamic Republic, I announce that Iran is not essentially against negotiations. Iranians are a civilized nation and always favor dialogue and are opposed to war.""

In the aftermath of the discussions in Kazakhstan, Saeed Jalili, Iran's chief negotiator, characterized the meeting in a positive tone, describing the aforementioned new offer from the P5+1 countries as  ""more realistic and positive""  and ""a little closer to Iran's position."" According to the New York Times, the offer would require  Iran end its program of  uranium enrichment to 20 percent,  export its stockpile of existing more highly enriched uranium, and close its Fordo enrichment facility.  In return or these three actions, the P5+1 countries would offer Iran sanctions relief,  including permission to resume trading of gold and precious metals, and permission to resuming limited  petroleum trading and international banking.

At the end of these talks in Kazakhstan where the new offer was brought forward, all the parties reportedly agreed to a round of further discussions in April 2013.  It was to be seen if these negotiation on the basis of the new proposal  would prove fruitful or accentuate the prevailing perception that the door on a negotiated resolution was rapidly closing.

Pressure on Iran was mounting with the call from the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Yukiya Amano, on March 4, 2013, saying that Iran should ""proceed with a sense of urgency"" and focus on achieving real and rapid results.  Amano reiterated its stance that the IAEA ""cannot conclude that all nuclear material in Iran is in peaceful activities.""  At issue was the IAEA's desire to inspect the  Parchin military site where testing related to nuclear weapons development was believed to have taken place, but where access to IAEA inspectors has long been subject to denial by Iran.

On the same day, United States Vice President Joe Biden said that President Barack Obama was ""not bluffing"" about the United States' determination to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.  In a speech in front of a major pro-Israeli lobbying group, he said, ""We're not looking for war. We're ready to negotiate peacefully. But all options including military force are on the table. While that window is closing, we believe there is still time and space (for diplomacy).""

The main question for the IAEA, the United Nations Security Council, the P5+1 countries, Israel, and the global community at large, involved the matter of how easy (or difficult) it would be for Iran to increase its uranium enrichment activities in a manner that would allow for the development of a nuclear bomb. Further, what kind of timeline was at stake in achieving this end?  Was United States Vice President Joe Biden's statement on Iran on March 4, 2013, pure bluster? Or was it a warning  of sorts from Washington to Tehran?

These questions would likely be complicated by the announcement of  new uranium discoveries in Iran and the Iranians' declaration that it was expanding its nuclear development program.  Iran said that it had found  new uranium deposits and as many  as 16 sites were deemed to be suitable for the construction of new power plants.  Iran additionally said that the discovery of uranium deposits would multiply ""the current amount of [uranium] resources,"" and thus facilitate the expansion of the country's nuclear development program. By mid-March 2013, as United States President Barack Obama was preparing to embark on his first official visit to Israel as a sitting American head of state,  the issue of Iran's nuclear development program was dominating the international geopolitical landscape.  For some time, Israel has threatened strikes on suspected Iranian nuclear facilities, in the interests of national security.  Indeed, Iran does not recognize the Jewish state of Israel and has issued repeated (often anti-Semitic) warnings to ""wipe Israel off the map,"" essentially posing an existential threat to the Jewish State.While the United States has eschewed imprudent military action against Iran, it has nonetheless stood with Israel in asserting that it would take necessary action to prevent the Islamic Republic of Iran from ever producing a nuclear weapon. Ahead of this visit to Israel, President Obama was signaling that Iran was yet some ways away from being able to produce a nuclear weapon.  In a pre-visit interview with Channel 2 in Israeli, he said that Iran was ""over a year or so"" away from being able to develop a nuclear weapon.  Still, President Obama said that he was not interested in leaving action against Iran for the last moment.  He said, ""We think that it would take over a year or so for Iran to actually develop a nuclear weapon but obviously we don't want to cut it too close."" Describing the purpose of his meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the issue of Iran, President Obama said, ""My message  will be the same as before: if we can resolve it diplomatically, that's a more lasting solution. But if not, I continue to keep all options on the table.""  The United States leader did not foreclose military strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities, saying, ""When I say that all options are on the table, all options are on the table and the United States obviously has significant capabilities."" Once ""in country"" in Israel, President Obama confirmed his stance on Iran, asserting the United States' resolve to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.  Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu  underlined the United States president's commitment on this issue,  saying he was ""absolutely convinced that the president [Obama] is determined to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons. In a significant development, Netanyahu acknowledged that Obama's stated one  year timeline on Iran's nuclear weapons development capacity was correct, although he noted that his [Netanyahu's] so-called ""red line"" involved the uranium enrichment aspect of weaponization and not the actual building of a nuclear weapon.  Of course, both uranium enrichment and the manufacture of a bomb would be involved in nuclear weapons development.  Accordingly, it seemed that  President Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu were respectively offering a sense of unanimity on the issue of Iran and its nuclear development program.Editor's Note

It should be noted that in mid-2012, a leaked report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) indicated that Iran was ready to double output at its Fordo underground uranium enrichment facility. According to the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency, Iran could soon double the number of its operational centrifuges from 700 to 1,400. Inspectors from the IAEA who have monitored the Fordo facility, which is buried in a mountain close to the holy city of Qom, have noted that while the uranium enrichment plant was not fully operational, it could well be ready in the space of only months. Moreover, increased production of 20 percent medium-enriched uranium would be possible. Medium enriched uranium (at 20 percent levels) can be used for conversion into fuel for Iran's medical research reactor; however, highly-enriched uranium at the 90 percent level would be needed for the development of nuclear weapons.

It should also be noted that this leaked report by the IAEA also indicated that ""extensive activities"" at the Parchin military site had ensued. The nuclear watchdog agency warned that Iran may have been trying to hide evidence of some sort of nuclear weapons experimentation. Accordingly, the IAEA concluded that it was ""unable... to conclude that all nuclear material in Iran [was being used for] peaceful activities.""

As noted here,  attempts in 2013 to reinvigorate the inquiry into activities at Parchin yielded no progress.  Moreover, Iran announced in February 2013 that it would be installing advanced machines to refine uranium at Natanz  -- a development that could potentially accelerate the  accumulation of materials used to develop a nuclear weapon. Together, this news  only served to raise the stakes  and increase the sense of anxiety over Iran's controversial nuclear development program. Special Report: Bombing at Iranian embassy in Lebanon viewed as consequence of Syrian conflict On Nov. 19, 2013, a double suicide bombing outside the Iranian embassy in the Lebanese capital of Beirut left more than 20 people dead and more than 140 others injured.  The first bombing was carried out by a suicide attacker on a motorcycle, while the second was executed by a suicide bomber in a a four-wheel drive vehicle. Among the dead was the Iranian cultural attache, Sheikh Ibrahim Ansari, who had just assumed his diplomatic post a month prior.Because Iran has been a well-known supporter of the Lebanese Shi'a Islamic extremist group, Hezbollah, which deployed  fighters to Syria to help the government of Bashar al-Assad hang onto power against rebel forces, there were suggestions that this attack was a manifestation of spillover violence from the Syrian civil war.  Certainly, the violence and bloodshed augured negatively for Lebanon as it pushed the country  further into a state of turmoil. Noteworthy was the fact that it was the first  since Lebanon's 1975-90 Civil War that an embassy had been targeted.  Moreover, the brazen act of violence illustrated the ease with which Lebanon  was being pulled into Syria's destructive orbit.  There was also a sectarian element to the attack as the  Sunni Jihadist group, Abdullah Azzam Brigades, claimed responsibility for the violence at the Iranian embassy in Beirut.  Via the Twitter account of the group's religious guide, Sheikh Sirajeddine Zuraiqat, Abdullah Azzam Brigades issued its formal claim of responsibility, declaring: ""The Abdullah Azzam brigades - the Hussein bin Ali cells - may they please God - are behind the attack on the Iranian embassy in Beirut.""  The group, which is linked with the notorious terror enclave, al-Qaida, also said that the bombings were a ""double martyrdom operation carried out by two heroes from the heroic Sunnis of Lebanon.""  The group threatened more attacks in Lebanon until Iran withdrew its forces from  Syria, bolstering the view that a sectarian conflict that transcended borders was emerging in the Middle East.  In Lebanon, caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati condemned the violence, calling it ""a cowardly terrorist act.""  Lebanese Parliamentary Speaker Nabih Berri -- a member of the Hezbollah faction in the Lebanese parliament -- warned that the terrorists behind the attack on the Iranian embassy were the people who attempted to assassinate him a year prior.  He was quoted in  Lebanon's Daily Star newspaper as saying, ""Those who targeted the embassy [Tuesday] are the same team that threatened to assassinate me.""There was also a global outcry against the bombings, especially given the fact that a diplomatic post was the target. United Kingdom Foreign Secretary William Hague  said: ""The U.K. is strongly committed to supporting stability in Lebanon and seeing those responsible for this attack brought to justice.""  United States Secretary of State John Kerry said, ""The United States knows too well the cost of terrorism directed at our own diplomats around the world, and our hearts go out to the Iranian people after this violent and unjustifiable attack.""  Special Entry: U.S. refuses visa request for Iranian diplomat involved in 1979 hostage crisis  In April 2014, Iran put forth a controversial candidate -- Hamid Aboutalebi -- as its selection to be that country's ambassador to the United Nations.  Aboutalebi was reported to be one of  the individuals who stormed the United States embassy in Tehran in 1979, and then held 52 United States hostages for 444 days. It should be noted that Aboutalebi has insisted that he simply acted as a translator during the hostage  crisis; however there was little likelihood that the United States was prepared to distinguish between ""levels"" of involvement in one of the darkest chapters of modern foreign relations history.  Given this background, the Obama administration in the United States  made clear that Iran's  choice  of Aboutalebi to be  ambassador to the United Nations was not acceptable.  As stated by White House press secretary, Jay Carney, ""The U.S. government has informed the government of Iran that this potential selection is not viable.""  Adding to Aboutalebi's woes was a bill in the Senate that barred him from entering the United States due to his active involvement in the Iranian hostage crisis.  Carney noted that the Senate bill was reflective of the White House's concerns, as he said, ""We share the Senate's concerns regarding this case and find the potential nomination extremely troubling.""  A similar bill in the House of Representatives also barred Aboutalebi from entering the United States due to his role in the Iranian hostage crisis.  There were some hopes that the White House's stated  position on Aboutalebi, augmented by the legislation in the United States Senate and House of Representatives, would together place pressure on Iran to withdraw the appointment.  However, it was also possible that Iran would hold steady, thus placing the United States in the position of possibly refusing to process Iran's application for a visa for Aboutalebi.To that end, Iran insisted that Aboutalebi had been selected for the post at the United Nations because of his diplomatic credentials and stood by his appointment.  In response to Iran's intransigence, the Obama administration in the United States  refused to grant Aboutalebi a visa, emphasizing its position that it would be impossible to grant diplomatic protection to a person who was involved in the flagrant deprivation of protection to American diplomats.The move effectively prevented Aboutalebi from taking the post of ambassador at the United Nations, since its diplomatic offices are based in New York  and on United States soil.  Iran's mission to the United Nations condemned the move, casting it as ""regrettable,"" and noting that the refusal to process Aboutalebi's visa was not in keeping with international law.  Indeed, a 1947 agreement requires the United States  to approve visa requests for designated diplomats from United Nations member states.Nevertheless, as April 2014 entered its last week, the United Nations' Committee on Relations with the Host Country opted to take no action against the United States for its refusal to grant a visa to  Aboutalebi.  At home in the United States, President Barack Obama  underlined his country's stance on the matter of individuals who act against the United States.  He signed into law a bill that would prohibit anyone from entering the United States as a diplomatic representative  who carried out espionage or terrorist activity and who may pose a threat to national security.Note:  It was to be seen if the dissonance over the United States' refusal to issue the Iranian diplomat a visa would affect the Iranian nuclear deal.  See below for developments regarding that deal.Foreign Relations Note: Yemen turns into proxy war between Shi'a Iran and Sunni Saudi ArabiaOn March 20, 2015, the notorious and blood-thirsty terror group, Islamic State (also known as Islamic State in the Levant or ISIL), carried out double deadly suicide bombings in the Yemeni capital of Sanaa, killing close to 140 people and injuring 300 others.The terror group, Islamic State has held sway in large portions of Syria and Iraq and been responsible for some of the most barbaric acts of murder, slavery, abduction and abuse seen in recent history.  While its aim to establish an ultra-hardline  Sunni Islamic caliphate has concentrated on the Syria-Iraq region (known as the Levant), an attack earlier in the week in Tunisia, as well as recently announced alliances with other Islamist terror groups, such as Boko Haram in Nigeria, indicate an emerging global Jihadist agenda.Already, Yemen has been dealing with exactly this threat of global Jihadism from al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) from within its own borders.  But now, with large swaths of Yemen under the control of the Shi'ite Zaidi Houthis, and with the country fracturing, Islamic State was exploiting the power chasm by making Yemen a terror target.  The fact that the suicide bombings ensued in Houthi-controlled Sanaa made clear that Islamic State was deliberately targeting the Shi'ite rebels, whom they consider to be apostates.For their part, the Houthi rebel movement (also known as Zaidis due to their Shi'ite Zaidi beliefs) had been engaged in fierce gun battles with Yemeni armed forces in 2014, ultimately gaining control of the capital of Sanaa and forcing the resignation of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, whose supporters were resisting the Houthis from their base in Yemen's second city of Aden.In the backdrop of these developments was a spate of vicious attacks by the Yemen-based terror group, al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) as they railed against the perceived ascendancy of the Houthis. Angered by the political gains of the Houthis,  the  terror enclave, AQAP commenced a campaign of violence and bloodshed in response. These developments heralded an emerging power struggle between the Houthis and AQAP, with the people of Yemen likely to be the ultimate victims. The main question in the immediate future was if this fight between the Houthis and AQAP would be limited to a power struggle for influence in Yemen where President Hadi was being increasingly sidelined, or if it would metastacize into a civil war.The developments in March 2015, marked by the entrance of Islamic State into the equation, served only to destabilize the Yemeni landscape even further.  The situation was morphing into a geopolitical morass, with the advance of the Iranian-backed Houthis on the second city Aden, the decision by President Hadi to flee the presidential palace, and the commencement of air strikes by Saudi Arabia on Yemen.Meanwhile, with Yemen embroiled in an escalating crisis, and as Western powers moved to distance themselves, regional powers were now signaling their entrance to the Yemeni landscape.  Already, Shi'a Iran was being blamed for backing the Houthis.  But soon Sunni Saudi Arabia was warning that it would intervene into Yemen to act as a countervailing power against Iran.Prince Saud Al Faisal promised to protect Yemen's sovereignty, saying,  ""We are against Iran's intervention in Yemen ... it is actually an act of aggression... We are keen on protecting Yemen's sovereignty, the legitimacy of Yemen represented by President Hadi."" He continued,  ""We are ready to take the necessary measures if needed.""Saudi Arabia's possible intervention was welcomed by the internationally-recognized Hadi government of Yemen.  President Hadi himself had called for the United Nations Security Council to authorize military intervention into Yemen. Also of note was a call by the Yemeni foreign minister, Riyadh Yaseen, for Arab neighbors to assist militarily to stop the advance being made by  Houthi fighters.  He said, ""We have addressed both the [Gulf Cooperation Council] and the U.N. for the need of [imposing] a no-fly zone and banning the use of warplanes at the airports controlled by the Houthis.""  Of course, that intervention was aimed at stemming the advanceof the Houthis and not necessarily at addressing the terror threats posed by al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula or Islamic State.In the early hours of March 26, 2015, following  the news the day before that President Hadi had fled the presidential palace in Aden, Saudi Arabia announced it had commenced air strikes in Yemen.  In fact, Saudi Arabia said its military operation was being conducted in coordination with a coalition of several regional partner countries.  The Saudi effort was aimed at stemming the Houthi tide  and restoring the internationally-recognized ""legitimate"" Hadi government to the helm in Yemen. But with the Houthis -- a Zaidi Shi'ite rebel movement -- being backed by Iran, and with Sunni Saudi Arabia now entering the fray, Yemen was quickly turning into a sectarian and geopolitical proxy war.Note that the United States soon announced that while it was not one of the partner countries carrying out air strikes in Yemen, it was nonetheless providing logistical and intelligence support to the Saudi-led operation in Yemen.After only a few days of air strikes, the Saudi-led regional forces had not yet overpowered the Houthis; however, they were limiting movement of the Shi'ite Zaidi rebellion and were successfully imposing a naval blockade.  As March 2015 was coming to a close, Saudi and Houthi fighters were embroiled in fierce fighting along the Saudi-Yemeni border.Fighting was also taking place in Aden between Houthi fighters and pro-Hadi loyalist forces.At the start of April 2015, despite the air strikes by the Saudi-led coalition, the Houthis were actually making gains on the  southern port city of Aden -- the one time stronghold of President Hadi.  With fighting increasing, a humanitarian crisis emerging, and the death toll increasing (almost 200 people were killed from late March through the first few days of April 2015 alone), several countries began the process of evacuating its citizens from Yemen, while the Red Cross was bringing in humanitarian aid supplies.It should be noted that in an interview with the Arabic television channel al-Arabiya Hadath, Yemeni Foreign Minister Riyadh Yasseen sanctioned the intervention of Arab powers into Yemen, calling for an actual Arab regional force help restore the elected goverment of President Hadi to power in Yemen and save the country from its slippage into chaos.He said, ""Yes, we are asking for that, and as soon as possible, in order to save our infrastructure and save Yemenis under siege in many cities.""Evidence of the Iranian-Saudi proxy war in Yemen was manifest in the second week of April 2015 when Iran called for the formation of a new Yemeni government, and even said it would be willing to offer its assistance in Yemen's political transition.  The statement came at a time when the Iranian-backed Houthis advance on the city of Yemen.  For its part, Saudi Arabia has been involved in air strikes on Yemen, with the intent aim of restoring President Hadi (who had taken refuge in the Saudi capital of Riyadh) to the helm of government.  It was apparent that the two countries were not only a military collision course but also on a parallel political one.Note that on April 14, 2015, the United Nations Security Council imposed an arms embargo on the Iran-backed Houthis. The resolution was overwhelmingly backed by security council members, although Russia abstained from the vote.As the Yemeni conflict escalated, the United States dispatched an aircraft carrier, the USS Theodore Roosevelt, and a guided-missile cruiser, the USS Normandy,  to the maritime waters close to Yemen.  The general consensus was that the presence of the USS Theodore Roosevelt and the USS Normandy was for strategic reasons, and intended to ensure that the United States was positioned to take rapid action if the situation necessitated it.  For its part, the United States  Pentagon said that its presence in the Arabian Sea was not to intercept Iranian arms shipments to Yemen, but rather to  ""ensure the vital shipping lanes in the region remain open and safe.""In a surprise move on April 21, 2015, Saudi Arabia announced that it was ending its bombing campaign against the Houthis. Saudi authorities declared the joint alliance had  achieved the military goals of the operation.  An official statement read as follows: ""Operation Decisive Storm has achieved its goals...(including) removing the threat to Saudi Arabia and neighboring countries, especially in terms of heavy weapons.""  The joint alliance would thus transition its efforts to a new mission called ""Restoring Hope."" The new operation would be aimed at counter-terrorism and security, and would look towards a political resolution in Yemen. Nevertheless, Saudi authorities warned that it reserved the right to go after the Houthis, with Saudi Brigadier General Ahmed Asseri saying, ""The coalition will continue to prevent the Houthi militias from moving or undertaking any operations inside Yemen.""Yemen's internationally-recognized leader, President Hadi, offered his thanks for the Saudi-led regional effort, saying, ""I express the deepest gratitude and respect to our Arab and Muslim brothers and friends in this exceptional strategic alliance in my name and on behalf of the Yemeni people.""While Iran welcomed the end of ""Operation Decisive Storm,"" the fact of the mater was that the fighting continued to plague Yemen, with around 1,000 people dying in the four week period from late March to the third week of April 2015.  Indeed, Houthis and factions loyal to President Hadi continued to engage in battles across the country, while infrastructure was being destroyed, and food and aid supplies were being depleted.  Accordingly,  there was an increasing call for United Nations negotiations to resume, with an eye  on finding a peaceful political solution to the conflict in Yemen.For their part, the Houthis intimated that a diplomatic process was underway, and there was an attempt to forge an agreement that would bring an end to the fighting.  But the Houthis  were unsure whether the Saudi announcement regarding an end to ""Operation Decisive Storm"" was part of that agreement.  Indeed, the news emerged on April 22, 2015 that even though an end to ""Operation Decisive Storm"" was over,  Saudi-led strikes were still taking place in southern Yemen.  It seemed that a mission remained in place to protect the port city of Aden from the Houthis.  Saudi Arabian ambassador Adel al-Jubeir explained the situation, saying, ""When the Houthis or their allies make aggressive moves there will be a response. The decision to calm matters now rests entirely with them.""Meanwhile, Iran was calling for ""urgent humanitarian assistance"" in Yemen, with Iran's foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif stating via the social media outlet Twitter, ""Positive developments in Yemen should be followed by urgent humanitarian assistance, intra-Yemeni dialogue and broad-based govt. Ready to help.""  Iranian President Hassan Rouhani  was meanwhile urging negotiations and a peaceful end to the bloodshed in Yemen, as he said, ""We believe that sustainable peace can prevail if military intervention is ceased and proper conditions are prepared for talks and dialogue among all political groups."" The Houthis themselves were signaling an interest in a return to United Nations-brokered negotiations, along with an end to the Saudis' aerial bombardment campaign.  Via the social media outlet Facebook, the Houthis' spokesperson, Mohammed Abdul-Salam,  declared:  ""We call for -- after the complete cessation of the brutal aggression on Yemen and the total dismantling of the blockade on its people -- the resumption of political dialogue under the auspices of the United Nations.""As April 2015 came to a close, the marine waters surrounding Yemen saw some de-escalation when the aforementioned Iranian flotilla, which was believed to be carrying arms to the Houthis, sailed past Yemen  and to the north.  The general consensus was that the presence of the USS Theodore Roosevelt and the USS Normandy in the area, may have had an effect. However, in a separate incident, Iranian forces fired warning shots and boarded a Marshall Islands-flagged cargo ship, the MV Maersk Tigris,  with a Danish crew in the Strait of Hormuz. The vessel was reported to be following a normal commercial route between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates when the shots were fired, thus spurring the crew to issue a distress call that was picked by by United States forces.  While Iranian authorities downplayed the incident, the United States Pentagon characterized the incident as a provocation.In early May 2015, the hotspot in Yemen continued to be the southern city of Aden where Houthi fighters battled forces loyal to President Hadi, despite continued Saudi-led strikes.  The fighting was quite fierce with more than 120 people killed on May 6, 2015, alone. Among the dead were people trying to flee the violence in a boat that was struck by shelling from Houthi fighters.  The situation in Aden was quite dire with Houthis advancing in the historic district of al-Tawahi -- the location of the presidential palace.Meanwhile, in the north, close to the border with Saudi Arabia, mortar and rocket fire killed five Saudi civilians, prompting retaliatory strikes by Saudi-led forces in that region.By mid-May 2015, Saudi Arabia was reported to be sending a ""strike force"" to its own border zone  with Yemen.  The move came after fierce artilery clashes with Houthi rebels in the area and was intended to reinforce the zone. Also in mid-May 2015, Saudi Arabia was launching air strikes on Sanaa. One strike on a rocket base left 90 people dead and hundreds others injured. It should be noted that these strikes were ensuing weeks after Saudi Arabia announced that it was ending its bombing campaign in Yemen, known as ""Operation Decisive Storm,""  and only days before a fresh ceasefire.It was apparent that despite the intervention of regional forces, and occasional announcements of breakthroughs, the Yemeni landscape continued to be one marked by chaos and turmoil in the spring of 2015.By the start of June 2015, regional coalition forces, led by Saudi Arabia, were striking Houthi targets in Yemen, with scores of people dying as a result.  A significant number of the dead included women and children in their own homes in the rural north of Yemen, close to the border with Saudi Arabia, which has long been the center of the Houthi rebellion.  Strikes were also  taking pace elsewhere in Yemen -- in Sanaa,  at Yemen's naval command  base at the port city of Hodaida on the Red Sea,  at a customs office in the northern province of Haradh, and even in thesouthern city of Aden.Despite the fatal effects of the strikes on Houthi civilians, Saudi Arabia and its allies were resolute in their efforts to stabilize Yemen and return the country to a state of legal governance -- ideally with President Hadi at the helm.  In an interview with Reuters News, Khaled al-Attiyah, the  foreign minister of Qatar, agued that the Saudi-led coalition strikes on the Houthis in Yemen had prevented the rebel movement from completely taking over the country.  He said, ""If there had not been (Operation) Decisive Storm, we would have seen the Houthis and Ali Abdullah Saleh's people all over Yemen.  I think Decisive Storm ... has restored legitimacy in Yemen.""It would seem that Foreign Minister Khaled al-Attiyah's claims held some truth given the Houthis' interest in returning to the negotiating table. Indeed, in the immediate aftermath of this latest spate of strikes, the Houthis were signaling their willingness to participate in United Nations-sponsored peace talks in Switzerland set for June 14, 2015.  Daifallah al-Shami, a member of the Shi'ite Zaidi leadership,  said in an interview with Reuters News  that the Houthi movement  was ready to support ""without preconditions the efforts of the United Nations to organize Yemeni-Yemeni dialogue.""  With rival groups, including those supportive of President Hadi and former President Saleh, also set to attend the peace talks, it seemed there was a genuine opportunity ahead to bring an end to the chaos rocking Yemen. South seccessionist factions, however, would not likely be in attendance and could function as the proverbial ""fly in the ointment.""By mid-June 2015, there were fews signs that United Nations-sponsored talks in Switzerland would produce anything substantial, or that the warring sides were willing to make the hard compromises needed for peace and reconciliation.Of note was the fact that as the talks were convened, the Saudi-led Arab coalition was striking Houthi targets in the Yemeni capital of  Sanaa.  Also of note was the intransigence of the pro-Hadi wing and the Houthis respectively.While  Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed  - the United Nations envoy to Yemen -- cast the talks as an opportunity to end the conflict in Yemen, he nonetheless acknowledged that a massive gulf divided the two sides.  He said,  ""All the parties are still barricaded behind their positions and continue to bet on war rather than a political settlement.""Indeed, there was no reason for either side  to buy into the benefits of peace when  the  facts on the ground were as follows:  1. Despite an aggressive air campaign, the Saudi-led coalition had failed to dislodge the Houthis;  and 2. Any peace agreement would likely be to the detriment of pro-Hadi forces in Yemen. For both sides, war offered a more promising path to power.In July 2015,Saudi authorities announced a ceasefire after air strikes hit a residential area of the Red Sea town of Mokha, killing approximately 120 people and injuring as many as 150 others.  Children were among the casualties, prompting the United Nations, Amnesty International, and Human Rights Watch to respectively warn the Saudi-led coalition that indiscriminate bombardment  of populated areas was a violation of international law.  It was not guaranteed that the Saudi-led coalition would  heed this admonishment; however, the coalition did respond to a call by Yemeni President Hadi  to halt the military activity long enough for humanitarian aid  to be rendered.  To this end, the cessation of the air campaign was to last for five days to allow emergency response teams to offer assistance and to deliver supplies to the victims.Although attention was focused at this time on the ceasefire,  the Saudi-led  coalition targeting the Houthis in Yemen warned that it would, nevertheless, reserve the right to retaliate against any military activity taken by the Houthis.  Of related significance was that the ceasefire did not bring a complete end to hostilities.  Clashes erupted  in the city of Taiz as a result of shelling by  Shi'a Houthis rebels several districts.As well, fighting was reported the the north of the restive port city of Aden and in the provinces of Marib  and Lahj.In September 2015, with the sectarian conflict between  Iranian-backed  Houthis and  the Saudi-backed Hadi government  forces still raging on, the landscape was complicated by the decision by Qatar to deploy 1,000 ground troops to Yemen.  The move came ahead of a massive offensive operation by regional Sunni Arab forces against the Iranian-backed Houthis who continued to hold sway in the Yemeni capital city of Sanaa.  Qatar was already part of the Saudi-led regional operation carrying out air strikes on Houthi-controlled regions of Yemen; however, its decision to deploy ground forces marked a notable shift in a campaign that has been stalled for several months, although some progress was made in driving Houthis and forces allied with former President Salleh from Aden.In the same period, Saudi-led air strikes continued to pound Houthi targets in Yemen.  The air battle  actually increased in strength after a particularly deadly attack  in the first part of September 2015 when a Houthi missile attack killed scores of Gulf Arab troops stationed to the east of Sanaa.  In retaliation, the air strike campaign by Sunni Arab states  on the capital  intensified and  deployments of troops were increased.  These developments came ahead of an offensive operation discussed above, which was being  billed as a ""decisive battle to liberate Sanaa."" Of course, Saudi ground forces were already ""in country"" and carrying out an offensive in the province of Marib, aimed at driving out the Houthis.  The Sanaa offensive was to be understood as a continuation of that operation.Meanwhile, even as plans for a final battle for Sanaa was in the works, the United Nations was planning to broker peace talks on the Yemeni crisis.  But those plans hit a snag in mid-September 2015 when Yemen's  government in exile, headed by President Hadi,  said it would not participate unless the Houthis withdrew from the terrain it captured. Of note was the fact that Hadi and his stalwarts were simply articulating the need to make good on  a provision already enshrined in the prevailing United Nations Resolution 2216.A few days later, Yemen's exiled government modified its stance, saying it would  join the United Nations-sponsored talks, but under the condition that the  Houthis publicly accepted  the terms of the United Nations resolution, which called for them to withdraw from the main cities of Yemen and recognize Hadias the elected president of the country. As noted by Yemeni government spokesperson Rajeh Badi in an interview with Reuters News,  ""If the Houthis are serious about sitting down for negotiations about implementing resolution 2216, they must publicly announce their recognition of this resolution.""In the last week of September 2015, the capital city of Sanaa was the site of bloodshed and violence due to double suicide bombings at a mosque that left at least two dozen people dead and scores more seriously injured.  Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack at the  al-Balili mosque, which ensued just as worshippers were celebrating the Eid al-Adha festival.In the same period of late September 2015, the Red Sea port city of Mocha was struck by tragedy when suspected air strikes hit a wedding party, killing at least 130 people.  The Saudi-led coalition operating in Yemen  and charged with targeting the Houthi rebellion  quickly dismissed any charges of culpability as follows: ""There have been no air operations by the coalition in that area for three days. This is totally false news."" Yet even as  the Saudi-led coalition  denied any responsibility for the incident, there were few other plausible explanations for a fatal air strikes in the area.It was unknown, however, as to whom was actually responsible for the deaths of more than 130 people at a wedding party.  Not surprisingly, the United Nations expressed condemnation for the incident, noting that the air strikes were emblematic of  ""the disregard shown by all sides for human life"" in Yemen.On October 6, 2015, members of the Yemeni government were targeted in a terror attack on the Qasr hotel where they were staying in Aden.  Prime Minister Khaled Bahah and members of his government escaped the double bombing at the hotel unharmed.But a series of attacks at two military installations housing coalition forces from the United Arab Emirates also took place on the same day with different results.  The violence at the military outfits exacted a death toll as 15  pro-government and Saudi-led coalition forces were killed.While initial blame for the spate of attacks fell on the Houthis, the terror group, Islamic State, soon claimed responsibility.  Clearly the Islamist terror group was taking advantage of the power vacuum created as a result of the power struggle between the Saudi-backed government and the Iranian-backed Houthis.Meanwhile, also in late September 2015,  President  Hadi returned from exile in Saudi Arabia to his stronghold in the southern city of Aden.By the start of October 2015, President Hadi's government moved to sever its diplomatic ties with Iran.While there was no detailed explanation offered for the move, the general consensus was that the legitimate government of Yemen objected to Iran's backing of the Houthis, and viewed Iran's actions as overt acts of interference in its sovereign affairs.Of course, as discussed here, the fact remained that several countries, including a Gulf Arab alliance, were now intervening into the affairs of Yemen.By October 2015, there was a glimmer of hope on the turmoil-etched Yemeni landscape as the Houthi rebels finally committed to the United Nations-brokered peace process,  although it was not known if they officially accepted the terms of a prevailing United Nations resolution.In a letter, the Houthi leadership declared: ""We, from our side along with other parties, commit to these seven points as one unified bundle. We welcome the UN call for all sides to return to the table of dialogue.""  At issue was the seven-point Muscat peace plan that was forged in Oman and which stalled for some time, but was now being revived with the Houthis signing on to the deal.Should the Houthis actually move forward by implementing the provisions of the Muscat agreement -- specifically,  enacting a ceasefire, withdrawing  from the cities, and accepting the return of the legitimate government to the capital city of  Sanaa  -- Yemen could well be backing away from the precipice of the crisis that has rocked the country for some time.Special Report: Breakthrough deal  forged on Iranian nuclear programSummary:The international community has been focused on aggressive multilateral negotiations  between Iran and the P5+1 countries of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia, and China, aimed at arriving at a landmark nuclear deal.  At issue was the goal of forging an accord that would regulate Iran's nuclear program, its stockpile of enriched uranium, and curtail Iran's ability to develop a nuclear bomb.  For Iran, the objectives were twofold.  First, Iran hoped to  prove that its nuclear development was for peaceful purposes and not aimed at weaponization, as charged by the West. Second, Iran was keen to end a painful international  sanctions regime that has badly damaged Iran's economy.Going back to January 2014,  an interim Iranian nuclear deal went into force. Under the terms of that interim agreement, Iran began the process of diluting its stockpile of  uranium enriched to 20 percent, with all such uranium expected to be eliminated within a six-month period. There were also provisions for  inspections  at the Arak heavy water reactor and the Fordo uranium enrichment site close to Qom.  While the interim deal constituted only a first step in the diplomatic track, it was certainly a significant development in that process aimed at establishing an enduring accord. Indeed, it represented a sea change in Iran's relationship with the United States, which was actively evolving from one singularly marked by hostility to one of (albeit limited) engagement. Now, with a final nuclear deal at stake, it was to be seen if that engagement would be ultimately deemed productive.At the end of March 2015,  the P5+1 multilateral talks with Iran were set to end, with all eyes on a framework for a long-term agreement.  But the negotiations were mired by various sticking points, prompting the parties to extend the negotiating process. Finally, in April  2015, after marathon talks, the P5+1 countries and Iran announced that the hard work of negotiations and diplomacy had yielded results, and that a framework agreement on Iran's nuclear program had been reached. The agreement presaged a long-term deal, which would have to be made by the final ""hard""  deadline on June 30, 2015.  The prevailing question  continued to dominate:  Could a final accord on Iran's nuclear program be forged?  Nevertheless, the framework agreement  marked a massive breakthrough in the realm of international diplomacy for the purpose of global security.Political resistance from rival Republicans and skeptical Democrats in the United States Congress and from Iran itself could upend the deal.Nevertheless, new rounds of nuclear negotiations commenced later in the spring of 2015 with an eye on forging  a sustainable final accord.  That final agreement  finally emerged on July 14, 2015, and, as expected,  evoked passionate resistance from hardliners at home in Tehran, and in other capitals across the world, including Washington D.C.Over the course of the rest of July 2015 and then through August 2015, the Obama administration in the United States was busy lobbying members of Congress to support the deal.  The goal was to gain enough support to sustain the expected presidential veto on a so-called ""disapproval resolution"" being advanced by Republicans in the legislative chambers, with support from skeptical Democrats. Of course, the detrators of the deal were also doing their part to garner enough support to override the expected presidential veto.  But by the start of September 2015, all signs posted to a political victory for President Obama and his administration's diplomatic efforts.  Indeed, the Obama administration garnered enough Congressional support for the deal. Debate and voting on the ""disapproval resolution""  commenced in the second week of September 2015, with Democrats successfully blocking a vote in the Senate.Note: Regardless of the political dimensions, the Iranian nuclear accord was being celebrated as a historic development in the realm of international diplomacy and global security.See below for the major developments leading up to the deadline for a proposed landmark accord.Background:In September 2013, as the United Nations meeting of the General Assembly in New York was set to take place, there were plans afoot for a sideline meeting of the six world powers (generally known as P+5 composed of the permanent United Nations Security Council members -- the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Russia, and China -- as well as Germany) with Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif.  The main topic to be addressed would be re-engagement on the Iranian nuclear issue. The meeting, which would include United States Secretary of State John Kerry, would mark the highest level bilateral contact between the United States and Iran in three decades.While the United States welcomed Iran's new tone and its interest in diplomacy, thanks to the election of the moderate Hassan Rouhani to the Iranian presidency, authorities in Washington D.C. also made it clear that the proverbial  ball ""was firmly in Iran's court.""  Of course, of significanc was the fact that Rouhani, upon his election, said that he rejected extremism of any kind, reminded people that his moderate political orientation was compatible with Islam, and  vowed to fulfill his campaign promises. At the top of that list was Rouhani's commitment to end the tough sanctions against Iran, which were imposed due to the West's conviction that the Iranian nuclear development program was not entirely for peaceful purposes, and included nuclear weaponization ambitions.It should be noted that in his own address to the United Nations, President Rouhani excoriated the harsh sanctions regime that was imposed on Iran, characterizing the sanctions as ""violent... pure and simple""  He emphasized the fact that common people, rather than political elites, were the primary victims  of the sanctions.It was apparent that President Rouhani's speech at the United Nations was not a continuation of the international ""charm offensive."" Instead, it seemed that the speech was geared towards a domestic Iranian audience, intended to validate the economic suffering being suffered at home.  That being said, Rouhani's admission regarding the damage done by the sanctions against Iran suggested that President Obama's ""smart sanctions"" policy was actually yielding results by forcing Iran from its former position of intransigence.  As September 2013 came to a close, a remarkable shift on the geopolitical landscape occurred as United States President Obama and Iranian President Rouhani  shared a historic call, marking the highest level direct contact between the leaders of two countries that have been in a state of enmity for decades.By October 2013 and well into November 2013, landmark negotiations were under way to deal with Iran's controversial nuclear program and there were cautious hopes that an agreement might emerge. In November 2013, talks ended without an agreement although there was concurrence that negotiations should be pursued, with an eye on a deal in the future.Economic Imperatives for Iran:There were serious economic imperatives that could nudge Iran in the direction of productive negotiations.  Due to the harsh international sanctions regime,  Iran has had to overcome steep obstacles in  selling its oil and receiving payments for its oil  exports. In places where Iran was still able to sell oil, it has been stymied from receipt of funds due to prevailing sanctions, especially those levied by the United States. But if Iran was not able to sell its typical  2.6 million barrels of oil a day, or, if it was forced to  sell those barrels at deep discounts, the decreased revenue inevitably had a debilitating effect on the Iranian economy, adding to the possibility of social unrest.In 2013, United States data sources indicated that the crippling sanctions imposed by the Western countries on Iran  were exacting a heavy toll.  Indeed, these United States statistics showed Iranian oil exports tumbling to a 26-year low.  The United States Department of Energy estimated that Iran's oil exports earned less than $70 billion billion in 2012 -- a  27 percent decrease as compared with  $95 billion in 2011.  As well, the  International Energy Agency -- a  watchdog entity --  estimated Iran lost more than $40 billion in export revenues in 2012.While Iran was mitigating the effects of devolving oil exports via higher oil prices (at the time), and despite trying to circumvent the sanctions on Iran's central bank by trading oil for goods, there were reports that Iran was storing an unusually large volume of oil in supertankers in the Persian Gulf.  This was due to dwindling purchasers from Asian markets.  As noted by the Financial Times, all expectations were that Iran would eventually have to  cut its already low production, which would exacerbate its burgeoning economic crisis.  With Iranians feeling the pain of the sanctions  in the form of inflation, the sliding  value of its currency (the rial),  and high unemployment,  economic anxieties and public discontent characterized the socio-economic climate in Iran.It was, thus, not surprising that the  newly-inaugurated President Rouhani's first speech at the helm included a call for an end to the crippling sanctions against Iran. Of course, Rouhani had to be aware that those sanctions were not about to dissipate without diplomatic progress and measurable policy changes as regards Iran's nuclear program.It was to be seen how far Rouhani would be willing to go -- in terms of serious diplomatic engagement over its nuclear program --in order to lift Iran out of its dismal  state of international alienation.Historic Diplomatic ShiftsThe prospects for diplomacy -- or at least, for less hostile relations between Iran and the United States -- increased slightly in the third week of September 2013.  In an interview with NBC News,  Rouhani confirmed that United States President Barack Obama had sent him a letter after his election as Iranian president. President Rouhani characterized President Obama's letter in positive terms, saying to NBC journalist Ann Curry, ""From my point of view, the tone of the letter was positive and constructive.""  Earlier, the White House said explained the correspondence with spokesperson Jay Carney saying that the United States was ""ready to resolve the nuclear issue in a way that allows Iran to demonstrate that its nuclear program is for exclusively peaceful purposes.""It should be noted that during the interview with NBC News, Rouhani also said  his administration would never develop nuclear weapons.  Rouhani additionally dismissed speculation that he did not have the real political authority to substantively address the Iranian nuclear development issue by emphasizing that he possessed the full authority to forge a deal with the West.As discussed here, by the second part of 2013, diplomatic engagement was under way, starting with the sideline meetings at theUnited Nations General Assembly in New York  between Iran and the six world powers (generally known as P+5 composed of the permanent United Nations Security Council members -- the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Russia, and China -- as well as Germany).Ahead of that landmark meeting, Iran seemed intent on softening its image on the world stage.  In addition to the Iranian president signaling his interest in re-engaging in nuclear talks, Iranian authorities also pardoned and released 80 prisoners including leading opposition figures who have been persecuted and jailed in the aftermath of the disputed presidential election of 2009 that gave rise to the failed ""Green Revolution.""After the meeting, more news stunned the world. Of note was the fact that President Obama  had spoken directly to Iranian President Rouhani on the phone as the Iranian leader was en route to the airport in New York. The call could only be regarded as historic since it was the first direct contact between the leaders of the United States and Iran in almost 35 years. According to President Obama himself, the 10-15 minute discussion focused on  Iran's nuclear program, and the conclusion reached was that there was a foundation for an agreement to be made.  As stated by President Obama, ""While there will surely be important obstacles to moving forward and success is by no means guaranteed, I believe we can reach a  comprehensive solution.""For his part, President Rouhani appeared eager to move forward, saying he hoped to reach an agreement on his country's nuclear program within a six-month period.  But perhaps more remarkable was President Rouhani's comments about his conversation with President Obama that he chose to share via Twitter.  The Iranian leader tweeted: ""In phone convo, President #Rouhani and President @BarackObama expressed their mutual political #will to rapidly solve the #nuclear issue.""  President Rouhani went further to note that he ended his call with President Obama by saying  ""Have a Nice Day!"" to which President Obama responded by saying, ""Thank you. Khodahafez.""  The word, ""Khodahafez"" is Persian for ""May God be your Guardian.""This level of cultural respect and  amity between the leaders of two nation states that have been in a state of enmity for more than three decades could only be regarded as stunning. Indeed, the fact that the Iranian president was apprising the world of his conversation with the leader of the free world -- Barack Obama --  via social media shocked even the CEO of Twitter himself.Dick Costolo issued the following observation, ""I feel like I'm witnessing a tectonic shift in the geopolitical landscape reading @HassanRouhani tweets. Fascinating.""In the first week of October 2013, Iran's  supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, endorsed the historic diplomatic progress made between his country and the United States.  Via the Internet, Khamenei said: ""We support the diplomatic initiative of the government and attach importance to its activities in this trip.""  However, Khamenei also expressed skepticism that actual progress could be made, adding, ""We are pessimistic towards the Americans and do not put any trust in them.""  Nevertheless, the supreme leader's de facto endorsement bolstered the possibility -- however remote -- of bilateral progress and the possibility that a deal might, in fact, be reached on Iran's controversial nuclear program.  Not all hardliners in Iran were as amenable to the new political landscape as Rouhani was met by protesters chanting ""Death to America"" when he arrived in Tehran from his visit to the United States to attend the United Nations meeting of the General Assembly.  Still, he was also greeted by supporters clearly pleased about the shift in tone in regards to relations with the United States.Demands of the West:It should be noted that the P5+1 countries have called on Iran to stop its production and stockpiling  of 20 percent enriched uranium (a capacity en route to the degree of enrichment needed to develop a nuclear weapon).  They have also asked that Iran close its underground uranium enrichment facility at Fordo, close to the city of Qom, where most of the higher-grade enrichment is produced. Another demand entailed Iran ending its construction of a nuclear reactor in Arak. The United States was looking for verifiable evidence that Iran was taking action on such measures.  Should these actions be taken, the P5+1 countries said they would entertain the possibility of easing the crippling sanctions regime that has terribly damaged Iran's economy.  That being said, it is worth noting that without the pressure of this very crippling sanctions regime, it was hard to imagine that President Rouhani would have been elected to power in Iran in the first place, or that he would be engaging in diplomacy at all.  As such, the success of the Obama administration's soft power approach of ""smart sanctions"" have to be acknowledged as the mean by which Iran was compelled to return to the diplomatic table.Productive Negotiations but no deal (yet):As intimated above in the section titled ""Background"", the first tranche of nuclear negotiations commenced in October 2013 in the spirit of cautious optimism. Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said, ""We had very constructive, very good exchange of views, very serious. It was, I can say, very businesslike.""  However, Araqchi expressed caution as he added: ""It's too soon to judge.""  Michael Mann, a spokesman for European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton,  appeared to back that version of the landscape as he said there was a sense of ""cautious optimism."" Mann later went further in suggesting that these were the first nuclear talks with Iran to go beyond the superficial level. He said, ""For the first time, very detailed technical discussions continued.""  Likewise, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif and European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton went so far as to issue a joint statement in which they characterized the talks as  ""substantive and forward-looking.""Israel showed little enthusiasm for the process with the government of that country releasing a statement that read as follows: ""Iran will be judged by its actions and not its PowerPoint presentations. Until we see practical steps that prove Iran is decommissioning its military nuclear project, the international community must continue with the sanctions,""A fresh round of negotiations ensued in November 2013. Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said progress was being made, despite the ""tough""  nature of the talks taking place.  In an interview with Reuters News, Zarif said,  ""The talks went well ... I'm hopeful that we can move forward. We are making progress, but it's tough."" Meanwhile,  Mann characterized the progress at the meetings as ""good"" but refrained from offering further details.  Despite these encouraging statements by Zarif and Ashton,  the meeting in Geneva  ultimately ended without an agreement being forged on Iran's nuclear program.  European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said, ""A lot of concrete progress has been made, but some differences remain.""  Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif took a measured tone in describing the failure to forge a deal when he said, ""I think it was natural that when we started dealing with the details, there would be differences.""There were some suggestions, however, that it was not only the granularity of the details in the proposed deal that appeared to have derailed the negotiations process, but dissonance within the negotiations group itself.  At issue, according to emerging media reports, was France's objection to the framework agreement.  Specifically, France reportedly objected to the  deal, believing that it would not do enough to curtail Iran's uranium enrichment.  Another particular bone of contention was the heavy-water reactor being constructed close to the city of Arak that would be capable of produce plutonium. Of note was the fact that plutonium can be used as an alternate means  (vis a vis uranium) to produce a nuclear bomb.There were also some fissures between the United States and the European countries on the matter of what economic sanctions against Iran might be reversed as part of a proposal.  Since the United States Congress initiated the harshest set of financial sanctions against Iran, and members of Congress were not in a mood to end them, United States President Barack Obama was looking towards a fairly circumscribed proposal involving Iranian funds frozen in overseas banks.  Sanctions by the European Union could more easily be reversed -- but to do so precipitously could incur unwanted results, such as the challenge of reinstituting the sanctions if Iran did not fulfil its obligations in a future deal.Taken together, the news at the time was that these unresolved issues complicated the conclusion of a deal.  But it was soon revealed that there was a third -- and significant -- element that led to the end of negotiations in  November 2013 without a conclusion.  According to United States Secretary of State John Kerry, the central reason for the lack of an agreement was the fact that Iran had walked away from the deal on the table. This revelation seemed to supplement (perhaps even contradict) the conventional media reports that France's objections had derailed the deal-making process.  In fact, Secretary of State John Kerry made clear that the deal on the proverbial table was approved by both France and the United States.  In statements to journalists, Secretary of State John Kerry explained that Iran was not yet prepared to accept the proposal.  The United States top diplomat said, ""The French signed off on it, we signed off on it, and everybody agreed it was a fair proposal....Iran couldn't take it at that particular moment; they weren't able to accept.""  Secretary of State John Kerry added that, given time, he had high hopes that the Iran and the P5+1 countries could  ""find an agreement that meets everyone's standards.""According to various sources, the main issue was not the Arak heavy-water reactor as had been suggested initially; indeed, the real sticking point was the same central source of controversy throughout the years:  Iran's insistence on its right to enrich uranium.Another round of talks was scheduled to be held later in 2013.  Noteworthy was the fact that the new talks were of a lower level and would not involve foreign ministers.  Still, the fact that the parties were willing to continue the negotiations suggested that there was an impetus to ultimately reach concurrence. For his part, Iran's top diplomat, Zarif, emphasized the positive aspect, saying: ""What I was looking for was the political determination, willingness and good faith in order to end this.  I think we're all on the same wavelength and that's important.""Of course, that ""same wavelength"" mentioned by Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif was cause for concern by Israel, with that country's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, demanding that Iran relinquish all its uranium -- not just the uranium enriched to the 20 percent level discussed above -- and close the nuclear reactor at Arak. There was little likelihood that Iran would agree to a  future deal involving the relinquishment of all its uranium, since such a move would foreclose any its leverage on the world stage.That being said, the international power brokers were taking Israel's demands seriously.  As stated by United States Secretary of State John Kerry, ""There are very strong feelings about the consequences of our choices for our allies...We have enormous respect for those concerns."" United States Secretary of State Kerry also dismissed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's excoriation of the proposed agreement as a ""bad deal,"" saying instead, ""We are confident that what we are doing can actually protect Israel more effectively and provide greater security.""IAEA report bolsters diplomatic track:In a positive sign that the diplomatic track was not being abandoned, the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said it had actually reached an an agreement on cooperation with Iran aimed at resolving the concerns over its nuclear program. The head of the IAEA, Yukiya Amano,  explained that the agreement facilitated  inspections by the United Nations' nuclear watchdog group to visit the aforementioned Arak heavy-water reactor as well as the Gachin uranium mine.Then, according to the quarterly IAEA report released in November 2013, Iran seemingly stopped expanding its uranium enrichment capacity in recent months and added no  major components  to its potential plutonium-producing reactor at Arak. Stated differently, Iran apparently ""paused"" its nuclear program for about three months.The moves appeared to be geared towards bolstering the diplomatic track. As noted by  Thomas Erdbrink, the Tehran bureau chief for the New York Times, via Twitter: ""For past three months Iran quietly essentially halted expansion and seriously slowed down production in nuclear program, unprecedented since '03.""Key findings of the report included the following:  Minor work was done on Arak reactor and access to heavy water plant was granted for first time since 2011; production of enriched uranium was reduced;  there were no new centrifuges in Fordo although there were four in Natanz.Of course, despite these seemingly encouraging signs, there were also indications of Iranian intransigence. Indeed, the report made it clear that Iran  was still forging ahead with some of its most controversial  nuclear activity, such as the enrichment of uranium to fissile concentration of 20 percent -- the ""problem"" level on the precipice of weapons-grade material.As such, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu emphasized that he was ""not impressed"" by the so-called concessions by Iran.  He said, ""They've got enough facilities, enough centrifuges to develop and to complete the fissile material which is at the core of an atomic bomb.""Perhaps not surprisingly, there remained a call for Iran to take much more significant steps in assuaging the international community of its peaceful nuclear ambitions, including the suspension of uranium enrichment.Accordingly, the report was reflective of the diplomatic landscape.  From the point of  view of Iran, it had made several concessions in the interest of finding a diplomatic solution; from the point of view of the West, the framework for agreement had to include the suspension of uranium enrichment.Interim breakthrough deal forged on Iranian nuclear program:A new round of talks in Geneva began at the end of November 2013.  This time, hopes of an agreement were now more subdued due to the fact that the earlier negotiations had not ended as the diplomats had hoped.  Moreover, foreign ministers from the P5+1 countries were not present as they had been in the previous round of negotiations.  For the moment, at least, the talks would go forward at a ""lower level"" of diplomatic engagement, although the goal remained the same: to forge a comprehensive accord on Iran controversial nuclear program.Presumably, progress was actually being made as United  States Secretary of State John Kerry arrived in Geneva. The presence of the United States top diplomat hinted towards the possibility that negotiations were moving in a productive direction.  According to Jen Psaki, the spokesperson for the United States Department of State,  Kerry had traveled to Genevato ""help narrow the differences and move closer to an agreement.""  She also indicated that the immediate objective was to reach an agreement that would ensure a temporary freeze on Iran's nuclear program for a six-month period. That halt would effectively give  negotiators more time to pursue a comprehensive accord on Iran's controversial nuclear program and to ensure that Iran was not allowed to build a nuclear weapon.Late in the evening on Nov. 23, 2013, Iran and the six world powers (the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia, and China)  announced that an interim breakthrough deal had been forged on Iranian nuclear program.  The announcement was made with great enthusiasm  by the foreign ministers of all of the countries involved in the negotiations process. The landmark agreement would temporarily freeze Iran's nuclear activities, even rolling back certain elements, in return for circumscribed sanctions relief.  The six-month halt would lay the foundation for a future accord by building confidence between sides who have little history of cooperation, and offering time to carry about the difficult task of drafting that agreement.Baroness Catherine Ashton, the European Union foreign policy chief, noted that the accord included ""reciprocal measures by both sides.""  She explained that the terms of the agreement would be coordinated by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).The central provisions of the deal were as follows:- Iran would  curtail its nuclear activities for an initial six-month period- Iran's uranium enrichment activities would be limited to levels below five percent purity -- the level needed to make a nuclear bomb- Iran would neutralize its stockpile of near-20 percent enriched uranium (via dilution to less than five percent or conversion to a form that cannot be further enriched)- Iran would refrain from installing further centrifuges used to enrich uranium- Iran would ensure that at least half of the centrifuges at the Natanz and Fordo enrichment facilities were inoperable- Iran would halt work on the construction of its heavy-water reactor at Arak and refrain from  plutonium production there- Iran would provide access to its nuclear facilities to international inspectors in order to verify that it was keeping its commitments- In return for these moves, Iran would garner limited relief from sanctions and would not be subject to further sanctions for a period of six monthsIt should be noted that the sanctions relief included a suspension of restrictions on Iran's petrochemical exports and certain other sectors such as gold and precious metals, thus yielding $1.5 billion in revenue.  As well, $4.2 billion from sales of Iranian oil would be allowed to be transferred in installments. Finally, there would be no new sanctions imposed on Iran for six months.For his part, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said, ""This is only a first step.""  He continued, ""We need to start moving in the direction of restoring confidence, a direction in which we have managed to move against in the past.""  Zarif also said the agreement presented an opportunity for the ""removal of any doubts about the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear program.""  Zarif was adamant that Iran had not relinquished its  right to enrich uranium, albeit within a framework for usage that met the requirements of the deal at hand.  He said, ""We believe that the current agreement, the current plan of action as we call it, in two distinct places has a very clear reference to the fact that Iranian enrichment program will continue and will be a part of any agreement, now and in the future.""That latter issue could present a bone of contention since the United States emphasized that the deal forged in Geneva, in fact, held no reference to  an Iranian right to enrich uranium. That being said, the fact of the matter was that this agreement was the first significant development in years on the issue of Iran's controversial nuclear program, which has periodically raised the specter of military actions.Accordingly, United Kingdom Foreign Secretary William Hague said the agreement was ""good news for the whole world.""  As well, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said, ""After years of blockages, the agreement in Geneva on Iran's nuclear program is an important step to preserving security and peace."" Meanwhile United States Secretary of State  John Kerry argued that the agreement would ""make our partners in the region safer.""  He added, ""It will make our ally, Israel, safer.""Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu had a very different view of the matter and angrily denounced the deal saying, ""This is a bad agreement that gives Iran what it wanted: the partial lifting of sanctions while maintaining an essential part of its nuclear program.""  Netanyahu also said that Israel did not feel bound by the agreement, thus suggesting that his country might carry out its own unilateral action against Iran if it felt that action would be in the best interests of Israel.Regardless of these threats by Israel, United States President Barack Obama welcomed the agreement, and emphasized that the terms of the deal included ""substantial limitations which will help prevent Iran from building a nuclear weapon.""  As well, President Obama noted that Iran would be held to account on keeping the commitments set forth in the deal.  In a news conference, the United States president noted that if Iran violated the terms of the agreement, ""We will turn off the relief and ratchet up the pressure.""Obama and the Iranian deal --While the deal constituted only a first step in the diplomatic track, it was certainly a significant step on the path towards rapprochement between the Islamic state of Iran and the West at large. Indeed, the accord represented a sea change in Iran's relationship with the United States in particular,  which was actively evolving from one marked by hostility  to one of engagement. It was to be seen if that engagement would be ultimately deemed productive.On the issue of engagement, it should be noted that the United States and Iran had been carrying out clandestine face-to-face meetings over the course of the year -- beginning prior to the election of President Rouhani.According to a report by the Associated Press,  William Burns -- the United States Deputy Secretary of State --  and Jake Sullivan -- the senior foreign policy adviser to Vice President Joe Biden -- convened meetings with Iranian officials several times earlier in 2013, with some of their talks taking place in the country of Oman.  These meetings, which were authorized by United States President Barack Obama,  were kept hidden from United States allies, including Israel, until September 2013.Of key importance was the realization that this agreement with Iran was not simply a sudden development resulting from marathon negotiating sessions only in the month of November 2013.  Instead, the accord was the fruit of President Obama's vision of outreach to Iran, matched by time-consuming diplomacy, and  marked by several key confidence-building steps aimed at dispelling the doubt, dissonance, suspicion, and even enmity that had, until this time, characterized United States-Iranian relations.Indeed, the revelations about secret meetings with the Iranians gave weight to the view that Barack Obama had been serious when he advocated for direct negotiations with Iran back in 2008 during his campaign  for the presidency of the United States.  Barack Obama's outreach towards Iran was pilloried by hardline factions in the United States in 2008, although it was this policy of vigorous diplomacy that gained him support during the primary election process from a United States citizenry weary from wars already taking place at the time in Iraq an Afghanistan.  Since becoming president, Barack Obama's ""smart sanctions"" approach to pressuring Iran was also subject to complaint and criticism from conservatives in the United States political sphere, who were calling for a military solution instead.Ideological differences aside, there was no debating the fact that it was the Obama administration's  imposition of ""smart sanctions"" that compelled Iran to come to the negotiating table in 2013.  In fact, ""smart sanctions"" may have even driven the Iranian  populace --  now tired of economic pressures such as inflation wrought by these punishing sanctions --  to select the most moderate of the presidential candidates  in that country's 2013 election.  Certainly, the election of Rouhani in Iran appeared to have acted as an imprimatur for diplomacy and engagement by the Iranian political establishment.Indeed, it was abundantly clear that despite the disapproval and criticism from hardliners and conservatives in the United States and Iran respectively, the diplomatic track was -- for the moment -- yielding results.  Of course, its ultimate success was yet to be determined. That success would be affected by the question of whether or not the United States Congress pushed forward new sanctions against Iran.  While the Republican-led House of Representatives was likely to support such a move, the Democratic-led Senate was still considering the best course of action.  All expectations were that the Senate would likely wait for the passage of the six month period specified in the interim nuclear deal  before moving forward with fresh sanctions.For his part, President Barack Obama shot back at his hawkish critics who opposed the recently brokered nuclear deal with Iran, emphasizing that their rhetoric was good for politics but did little to advance national security.President Obama also emphasized the fact that he made no secret of his foreign policy agenda during his time as Candidate Obama, noting that he was keeping his campaign promises to end the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and to engage with Iran for the purpose of ensuring that country was not able to manufacture a nuclear bomb. During a visit to California at the end of November 2013, he said, ""When I first ran for president I said it was time for a new era of American leadership in the world, one that turned the page on a decade of war and began a new era of our engagement with the world.""  He continued, ""As president and as commander in chief, I've done what I said.""The United States president had a particularly direct response to his critics at home regarding the Iranian deal, as he declared, ""Huge challenges remain, but we cannot close the door on diplomacy, and we cannot rule out peaceful solutions to the world's problems. We cannot commit ourselves to an endless cycle of conflict... Tough talk and bluster may be the easy thing to do politically, but it's not the right thing for our security.""The president also emphasized the human cost of that ""endless cycle of conflict."" Speaking of his visits to the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center where injured soldiers were treated for their war wounds, President Obama said, ""I spend too much time at Walter Reed looking at kids -- 22, 23, 24, 25 years old -- who've paid the kind of price that very few of us in this room can imagine on behalf of our freedom, not to say that I'm going to do every single thing that I can to try to resolve these issues without resorting to military conflict.""His words appeared to have found resonance with the American citizenry.  Although he was suffering from low approval ratings -- as was the case for all United States politicians from the two main parties -- President Obama's foreign policy approach to dealing with Iran was earning him high marks.According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll, Americans were backing the Obama administration's Iran deal by 2-to-1 margin.  As well, the polling data showed a war-weary  American citizenry -- indeed, one mistrustful of the Iranians yet  highly skeptical of further military action,  even if  the diplomatic track with Iran failed to yield positive results.  According to the poll, if the Iranian deal on the table were to fail, close to 50 percent of people preferred the notion of increased sanctions against Iran, 31 percent favored greater diplomacy, and a paltry 20 percent favored military force against Iran.  Stated differently, despite strong Republican support for a hardline approach to Iran, there was actually no public appetite for it.That being said, for President Obama, there was also the question of political legacy.  He could potentially enter history as the president who crafted a landmark deal with Iran, paving the way for greater global security -- or -- he could be the president who allowed Iran to move further along the path to becoming a nuclear power in the world's most volatile region.Date set for Iranian nuclear deal  to go into force:In January 2014,  a date was set for the Iranian nuclear deal to go into force.  On Jan. 20, 2014, Iran would begin the process of diluting its stockpile of  uranium enriched to 20 percent, with all such uranium expected to be eliminated within a six-month period.  As well, there would be provisions for monthly inspections  at the Arak heavy water reactor, and daily access made available to nuclear inspectors to the Fordo uranium enrichment site near the holy city of Qom.United States  President Barack Obama  applauded the news  of a ""go-forward"" date but also acknowledged that further effort was needed to forge a long-term deal. He warned that fresh sanctions would be afoot if Iran violated the terms of the deal.  In a statement, President Obama said ""Beginning 20 January, Iran will for the first time start eliminating its stockpile of higher levels of enriched uranium and dismantling some of the infrastructure that makes such enrichment possible...Meanwhile, we will continue to vigorously enforce the broader sanctions regime, and if Iran fails to meet its commitments we will move to increase our sanctions.""  Of course, it should be noted that the  very deal could be thwarted by the effort of the United States Congress, which was preparing to impose additional sanctions.  For his part, President Obama made it clear that he would veto any legislation that advanced fresh new sanctions during the period  when there were ongoing negotiations with the Iranians.United States Secretary of State John Kerry  echoed President Obama's sentiments, as he lauded the implementation of the nuclear agreement with Iran as a significant step, while also noting the difficulties in forging a longer-term deal.  Secretary of State Kerry warned the next phase of negotiating a long-term nuclear agreement presented a ""far greater challenge.""  He said, ""The negotiations will be very difficult but they are the best chance that we have to be able to resolve this critical national security issue peacefully and durably.""Developments related to the interim nuclear deal in 2014:On Jan. 20, 2014, the landmark nuclear deal went into effect with Iran starting the process of curbing uranium enrichment. To this end, the IAEA confirmed that  Iran had ceased enriching uranium above five percent purity mark at both the Nantaz and Fordo facilities.  Meanwhile, the Iranian media was reporting that the centrifuges used for enrichment at the Natanz plant were disconnected.  As he announced this very process at Natanz, the head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, Ali Akbar Salehi, said  ""The sanctions iceberg against Iran is melting."" In exchange, the United States and the European Union would respond with limited sanctions relief.  Casting the commencement of the agreement in positive light, Catherine Ashcroft, the European Union's foreign policy head, said, ""This is an important day in our pursuit of ensuring that Iran has an exclusively peaceful nuclear program.""  A day later on Jan. 21, 2014, the IAEA said that  the first round of inspections went well and, as such,there was a need to  double the size of the inspection team used to monitor nuclear activity.Moving forward to February 2014, the attention was on the negotiations aimed at finding a permanent resolution to Iran's controversial nuclear program.  For the West, that hypothetical agreement would delineate the parameters of an acceptable  nuclear program for Iran and  alleviate their suspicions about Iran's ambitions to build a nuclear bomb.  For its part, Iran has consistently insisted that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only; however, Iran has had a poor record of cooperating with the IAEA,  and its secretive activities at clandestine nuclear facilities have only added to the West's anxieties.As the P5+1 countries met in February 2014, the Iranian foreign minister acknowledged  that forging an agreement would be difficult, but he also expressed optimism that a permanent deal was possible.  Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said, ""If all sides enter the talks with the political will, we will be able to reach positive results. But it will take time.""The United States was more restrained about its stance, indicating that the negotiations had a 50 percent chance of success -- and failure.Overall, the fact that Iran was actively involved in the diplomatic track  represented a sea change,  Indeed, Iran's relationship with the United States was actively evolving from one marked by hostility to one of engagement. It was to be seen if that engagement would be ultimately deemed productive.The IAEA noted at the start of March 2014 that although much work remained, Iran was nonetheless meeting its obligations to reduce its nuclear stockpile as required by the prevailing nuclear deal.  Of particular note was the dilution of its stock of higher-enriched uranium to a lower fissile concentration that would be unsuitable for making an  atomic bomb.  Yukiya Amano, the head of the IAEA, said that Iran had made enough progress to warrant receipt of a March 1, 2014, installment of  funds previously blocked by sanctions (the total in this case would be about $450 million).At the same time, the West continued to pressure Iran to address its  suspicions over the design and manufacture of an atomic bomb -- activity Iran has insisted was not occurring.  The United States warned that Iran would have to satisfy the West's doubts on this matter if they were to forge a final settlement over Tehran's nuclear program. As noted by the United States' ambassador to the IAEA, Joseph Macmanus, ""It is a central element to this negotiation, and all parties recognize that.""  Iran has shown some willingness in this regard, having agreed to provide answers in regard to the development of fast-acting detonators with both military and civilian applications.  The West, however, has cautioned that more effort must be expended by Iran.Multilateral talks in March 2014 were marked by a willingness to negotiate, juxtaposed against tensions due to disagreements on the future of the Arak heavy water reactor that could potentially produce plutonium for the manufacture of atomic bombs.  Another source of contention centered on the level of uranium enrichment to be conducted in Iran. There were no resolutions forged on these matters and the two sides simply agreed to meet again in April 2014.Meanwhile, as the March 2014 talks were taking place, revelations emerged about  Iran's continued purchase of prohibited components links with the country's nuclear program.  According to Vann Van Diepen,  the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for International Security and Non-Proliferation, said Iran was still forming front companies that were being used to conceal their nuclear procurement activities. In an interview with Reuters News, Van Diepen said, ""They still continue very actively trying to procure items for their nuclear program and missile program and other programs.""  He added, ""We continue to see them very actively setting up and operating through front companies, falsifying documentation, engaging in multiple levels of trans-shipment ... to put more apparent distance between where the item originally came from and where it is ultimately going."" While the purchase of such components do not violate the recent breakthrough nuclear agreement (discussed directly above), they were nonetheless in contravention of the 2006 United Nations embargo that bans other countries from providing Iran with materials and supplies needed for a nuclear and missile development program. Iran had no comment in response to these allegations.In April 2014, the world's nuclear watchdog group -- the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) -- announced  that Iran had ""reduced its stockpile of higher enriched uranium by  half, in keeping with a prevailing nuclear agreement aimed at easing the harsh sanctions regime against Iran.  To be specific, Iran diluted half of its higher enriched uranium reserves to a fissile levels unsuitable for nuclear proliferation. As well, Iran has continued to convert the other half of its stockpile of 20 percent enriched uranium into oxide for making reactor fuel.On the other side of the equation, the IAEA made note of the fact that the commissioning of a facility intended to transpose lower enriched uranium into oxide powder had been delayed.  Of concern here was the fact that without such a facility in effect, Iran would be stockpiling greater quantities of low enriched uranium.  According to the IAEA, Iran has said that it still intends to convert the uranium, irrespective of the plans for the construction of this particular plant.These developments overall showed that Iran was making good on its promise to abide by its commitments enshrined in the deal.  In return, Iran was  incrementally gaining access to some of its previously frozen overseas funds. Indeed, the United States Department of State soon announced that it was moving to release as much as $450 million in blocked assets in response to the IAEA assessment.  As well, there were reports that Japan has made two more payments totaling $1 billion to Iran for crude oil imports.At the start of July 2014, United States Deputy Secretary of State Bill Burns was expected to participate in multilateral negotiations in the Austrian capital of Vienna aimed at finalizing a long-term nuclear deal  by July 20, 2014.  Burns' participation indicated the possibility of bilateral negotiations  between the United States and Iran on matters beyond the nuclear politics, quite possibly touching upon the security crisis rocking Iraq at the hands of Sunni extremist terrorists.With an eye on facilitating a productive path, it was  soon announced that United States Secretary of State John Kerry, along with the foreign ministers from  the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia and China, would be joining the negotiating table.  The presence of the six foreign ministers from the P5+1 nation states was not necessarily a sign that a long-term deal to resolve concerns over Iran's nuclear could be reached by the July 20, 2014, deadline. Instead, the conventional wisdom remained that  an extension of the existing deal was likely necessary, but to even reach that point, the distance between negotiating positions had to be narrowed.  The participation of the top diplomats from the P5+1 nation states  was more than likely aimed at narrowing that gap.By July 14, 2014, following the conclusion of this round of nuclear talks in Vienna, United States Secretary of State John Kerry made clear that if Iran wanted to secure a long-term agreement with the world powers and bring an end to damaging sanctions, it would have to reduce  its capacity to make nuclear fuel. In an address to the media, Secretary of State Kerry said, ""We have made it crystal clear that the 19,000 (nuclear centrifuges) that are currently part of their program is too many.""For its part, Iran was attempting to advance an alternative path with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif suggesting that Iran might keep its enrichment program at existing levels  for a few years (essentially an extended ""pause""), while also holding onto the 19,000 centrifugs it had installed for an industrial-scale uranium enrichment program.  However, the P5+1 countries were not as interested in that type of concession as they were seeking to ensure that Iran simply did not pursue nuclear fuel needed for the manufacturing of a nuclear bomb.  In fact, as noted by United States Secretary of State John Kerry, the  very notion that Iran  would be able to keep all of its existing centrifuges was simply ""out of the question.""While it was not clear that there would be a meeting of the minds on the actual path forward, both sides seemed earnest in their efforts to advance the negotiations with Kerry saying, ""It is clear we still have more work to do and our team will continue to work very hard to try to reach a comprehensive agreement that resolves the international community's concern.""  He added, ""There are more issues to work through and more provisions to nail down to ensure that Iran's program can always remain exclusively peaceful."" Zarif's comments echoed a similar tone as Kerry's as the Iranian foreign minister saying, ""I see an inclination on the part of our negotiating partners that they believe more time may be useful and necessary.""As expected, on July 18, 2014, it was announced that the deadline for reaching a deal on Iran's nuclear program would be extended for four months until November 2014.The extension would provide all parties with more time to engage in nuclear negotiations, with the goal of achieving a final deal by Nov. 24, 2014. A joint statement issued by the European Union foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton,  and Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, read as follows: ""There are still significant gaps on some core issues which will require more time and effort.""During the four-month extension period, most sanctions against Iran would remain in place; however, Iran would be permitted to access an additional $2.8 billion of its frozen assets.  United States Secretary of State John Kerry said that in exchange for the access to these funds, Iran would continue to use its most problematic stores of uranium (those enriched to a level of 20 percent) for  a research reactor that is used to make medical isotopes. Kerry also addressed the contentious issues requiring more negotiations as he said, ""There are very real gaps on issues such as enrichment capacity at the Natanz enrichment facility. This issue is an absolutely critical component of any potential comprehensive agreement. We have much more work to do in this area, and in others as well.""NOTE: As of 2015, a negotiations extension remained in place with an eye on finally forging a deal or at least at ending the negotiations process aimed at a final agreement.2015 Update on Nuclear Negotiations:As of March 2015, despite a diplomatic contretemps between the United States and Israel over multilateral nuclear negotiations with Iran, the diplomatic process was ongoing.That contretempts reached new heights on March 3, 2015, when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  went to Capitol Hill in the United States to give an address to Congress. In that speech, he warned that the nuclear deal being negotiated by global powers and Iran in Geneva, Switzerland, would actually herald a nuclearized Iran.  To this end, he said, ""This deal doesn't block Iran's path to the bomb, it paves Iran's path to the bomb."" Disparaging the efforts being carried out by United States Secretary of State John Kerry and his counterparts from the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia and China,  Netanyahu said: ""We've been told that no deal is better than a bad deal. Well this is a bad deal, a very bad deal.""Not surprisingly, the Israeli leader had harsh words regarding Iran, reminding the chamber -- and the worlds -- that ""Iran's regime is as radical as ever, the ideology is deeply rooted in militant Islam... it will always be an enemy of U.S.""  He also noted that the Iranian imprint was growing in the Middle East, as it meddled in the affairs of countries such as Iraq and Yemen, while backing Lebanon-based Hezbollah.  To this end, Nentanyahu said that Iran was on a ""march of conquest, subjugation and terror.""Netanyahu's speech, despite the boycott by as many as 60 Democrats, was well-received by the Republican-dominated Congress.  Indeed, Republicans in Congress made a point to giving the Israeli leader a far warmer reception, with more boisterous applause than had been conveyed to President Barack Obama at the State of the Union less than two months earlier.For its part, the White House blasted the Israeli prime minister's address as being filled by rhetoric and short of good ideas. As noted by President Obama himself after the Netanyahu visit to Capitol Hill, ""On the core issue, which is how to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon which would make it far more dangerous, the prime minister [Netanyahu] did not offer any viable alternatives.""Nevertheless, the fact of the matter was that Netanyahu's address was a political success that would likely help him with hardline voters at home, while currying favor with hardliners across party lines in the United States.  Of course, it was more difficult to ascern whether the Netanyahu speech was necessarily in the best interests of the United States.The reality was that without an agreement of some sort, Iran would likely move forward with the pursuit of its nuclear program, which could potentially involve bomb production. Indeed, it was only the interim nuclear deal (set to expire in mid-2015), which created the space for nuclear negotiations to take place, that had brought any halt to Iranian nuclear acitivites.  Before the interim agreement was forged, despite the imposition of harsh sanctions, Iran was producing centrifuges and fissile material. Without a nuclear accord going forward, Iran would be free to resume unfettered nuclear activities.Of note was the fact that President Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu have viewed the Iranian nuclear problem differently.  For President Obama, the imperative has always been the same: To prevent Iran from producing a nuclear bomb.  But for Prime Minister Netanyahu, the objective has been to prevent Iran from having nuclear capability.  While the two respective goals overlap, they must be understood distinctly.A good deal for President Obama would be one in which Iran's nuclear program is curtailed, regulated, and monitored to the extent that its breakout time for creating a bomb would be lengthy and difficult.  No deal would likely be acceptable to Prime Minister Netanyahu, who was determined to see Iran's nuclear capability ended in totality, and all of its nuclearfacilities dismantled.  Short of military action, it was difficult to see how Netanyahu's goals would be accomplished.  But even military strikes would  be risky since multiple sites -- from the uranium enrichment plants at Natanz and Fordo, to the heavy-water plutonium reactor at Arak, not to mention an array of laboratories and mines at stake.Of significance was the fact  that the very case by Israel (at least, as conveyed by Netanyahu) was being tarred by questions of credibility.  At issue was the release of a cache of confidential intelligence documents that appeared to contradict Netanyahu's claims about Iran being imminently positioned to manufacture a nuclear bomb.  Leaked cables -- reportedly from South African intelligence. but which were shared with certain news outlets -- indicated that in an address before the United Nations in 2012, the Israeli leader misrepresented Iran's progress on nuclear development, and even contradicted Israel's own Mossad secret service to make that claim.Going back to 2012, Netanyahu famously stood before the United Nations General Assembly with a cartoon depiction of a bomb with a red line and declared that Iran would be positioned to build a nuclear weapons the following year.  As such, he demanded global action to prevent Iran from achieving that end.  Now, however, in 2015, the leaked documents, whch were shared with Al-Jazeera and published by The Guardian newspaper,  included conclusions from Israel's own Mossad intelligence agency that Iran was ""not performing the activity necessary to produce weapons.""  The Mossad briefing did note that Iran appeared to be moving in a direction ""which will reduce the time required to produce weapons.""  However, the Mossad briefing also asserted that Iran ""does not appear to be ready"" to enrich uranium to the higher levels necessary for nuclear weapons.  (The manufacture of a nuclear bomb would require enrichment of 90 percent.)It should be noted that in response to the revelations ensconced in these leaked documents, the Israeli government said there was little difference in Netanyahu's claims as compared with Mossad's findings.  Both agreed  that Iran was indeed seeking to manufacture a nuclear bomb.Regardless of Iran's actual intent or the actual timeline at stake, the difficult diplomatic work of trying to forge an agreement that would prevent Iran from producing a nuclear weapon was ongoing.It should be noted that in the aftermath of the Netanyahu speech, United States Secretary of State John Kerry warned that simply demanding Iran's capitulation was unlikely to compel that country to voluntarily halt its nuclear development program.  Kerry's remarks intimated criticism for the muscular language emitted by the Israeli leader, which were heavy on rhetoric but unlikely to achieve actual results. Instead, Secretary of State Kerry noted that the diplomatic path presented a serious path forward.  He said,  ""No one has presented a more viable, lasting alternative for how you actually prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. So folks, simply demanding that Iran capitulate is not a plan. And nor would any of our P5+1 partners support us in that position."" At the same time, Secretary of State Kerry made clear that the while the hard work of diplomacy was yielding results, there remained ""significant gaps and important choices that need to be made"" by Iran.In Iran, President Hassan Rouhani emphasized his country's position. Rouhani indicated that Iran was prepared to subject itself to greater scrutiny, in order to satisfy the international community's concerns about nuclear weapons production.  But at the same time, he reiterated Iran's long-standing stance that it was entitled to nuclear development.  Rouhani said, ""If the basis of these negotiations is for increased transparency, we will accept greater transparency. But if the negotiations are trying to prevent the people of Iran from their inalienable right, in other words advancement in science and technology, it is very natural that Iran will not accept such an understanding or agreement.""Of course, concerns about Iranian nuclear development, and a potential nuclear deal, extended not only to Israel but also to the Sunni Arab world.  Of note was the ever-increasing sectarian divide between Shi'ites and Sunnis in the Middle East since the invasion of Iraq in 2003, and the Arab Spring in 2011. With this schism only deepening, Sunni countries, such as Saudi Arabia, were increasingly concerned about an ascendant Shi'ite Iran.  Indeed, Iran already had its imprint in the Syria-Lebanon area due to tacit support of Hezbollah, and had tightened its alliance with Iraq in the post-Saddam Hussein era, and was now believed to be clandestinely backing the Shi'ite Zaidi rebellion (known as the Houthi rebellion) in Yemen.  The notion of a nuclearized Iran, already with its tentacles stretching across the region, was not regarded positively by several Arab countries. Accordingly, Secretary of State Kerry traveled to Saudi Arabia to calm the anxieties of several Sunni Arab countries, including  Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia itself, regarding a potential Iranian nuclear deal.Speaking to this issue, Secretary of State Kerry said, ""For all the objections that any country has to Iranian activities in the region, and believe me, we have objections and others in the world have objections, the first step is to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.""  At stake was the goal of reaching the ""right deal,"" which Kerry said would  ""close off any paths that Iran could have towards fissile material for a weapon.""To that end, the diplomatic track was continuing and the latest round of multilateral talks -- involving the United States, the United Kingdom, France,  Germany,  Russia, and China -- appeared to be making progress, with all eyes on late March 2015 as a possible timeline for a deal, with the details ironed out and solidified by a mid-2015 deadline.United States Secretary of State John Kerry indicated that the negotiations were productive, saying to the media: ""We made progress.""  His Iranian counterpart, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif,  said they were forging ""a better understanding"" at the negotiating table.The comprehensive pact appeared to be geared towards constraining Iran's nuclear breakout capability, and restricting Iran's nuclear activities for a 10-year period, with an easing of restrictions on nuclear development after that time. Under consideration was a plan to deal with most of Iran's enriched uranium externally, or to convert it to a form that would not be easily used in weapons development.  Overall, there would be strict curbs on Iranian nuclear development for a decade, particularly with regard to the handling of enriched uranium and the number of centrifuges at stake.  But there would also be ""rewards"" of sorts  for Iranian compliance and cooperation in the form of gradually eased restrictions and the lifting of sanctions.  The United Nations' nuclear watchdog agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency, would play a central role in any proposed deal, and  would have the primary responsibility of monitoring Iran's compliance and cooperation.In the second week of March 2015, in the wake of the controversial Netanyahu address to Congress, 47 Republican senators published an open letter to Iran.  The  signatories to that document sought to instruct the Iranian goverment about United States constitutional law, which they suggested the Iranians might not ""fully understand."" The letter, which was spearheaded by freshman Republican Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, made the claim that  any nuclear deal that might emerge from the negotiations in Switzerland would be ""nothing more than an executive agreement between President Obama and Ayatollah Khamenei,"" and thus require congressional approval while being subject to revocation by a future president.  To this end, the letter included the following sentence: ""The next president could revoke such an executive agreement with the stroke of a pen, and future Congresses could modify the terms of the agreement at any time.""It was difficult to interpret the missive as anything other than a transparent attempt to undermine President Barack Obama's leadership in the realm of foreign policy. Indeed, editorials from more than 22 cities across the country excoriated the 47 Republican senators for their action, which they characterized as a reckless and partisan stunt. Some newspaper boards even argued that by dispatching that missive, te 47 Republican senators were marching the country down the road of war.  Almost all the editorials vociferously criticized the 47 Republican senators for betraying the national interests of the United States, whose constitution, accords broad authority to the president to conduct foreign policy.From the Senate,  Minority Leader Harry Reid -- the top Democrat in the upper chamber -- minced no words as he declared: ""Let's be clear: Republicans are undermining our commander in chief while empowering the ayatollahs."" Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who was expected to seek the Democratic nomination for president in 2016, entered the fray, saying that the letter's signatories could only be motivated by one of the following two rationales. She said, ""There appear to be two logical answers. Either these senators were trying to be helpful to the Iranians or harmful to the commander-in-chief in the midst of high-stakes international diplomacy. Either answer does discredit to the letter's signatories."" White House spokesperson, Josh Earnest, said the letter was intended to undermine diplomacy and could spur a ""rush to war, or at least the rush to the military option.""For his part, President Barack Obama responded to the infamous letter by accusing the 47 Republican senators of ""interfering"" in nuclear negotiations -- an arena typically reserved for the executive branch of government.  He also  sardonically noted that the 47 signatories constituted an ""unusual coalition"" with Iran's hard-line religious leaders, who have also opposed the nuclear negotiations.  As noted by President Obama: ""I think it's somewhat ironic to see some members of Congress wanting to make common cause with the hardliners in Iran. It's an unusual coalition.""  Vice President Joe Biden -- a former Senator himself and the official president of the upper chamber -- was more vituperative in his condemnation. Vice President Biden said that the letter from the 47 Republicans was ""beneath the dignity of an institution I revere."" He added, ""In 36 years in the United States Senate, I cannot recall another instance in which Senators wrote directly to advise another country -- much less a longtime foreign adversary -- that the president does not have the constitutional authority to reach a meaningful understanding with them,""Of significance was the reaction by the Iranian Foreign Minister, Dr. Javad Zarif, who dismissed the letter as a ""propaganda ploy."" Zarif said, ""In our view, this letter has no legal value and is mostly a propaganda ploy.  It is very interesting that while negotiations are still in progress and while no agreement has been reached, some political pressure groups are so afraid even of the prospect of an agreement that they resort to unconventional methods, unprecedented in diplomatic history.  This indicates that like Netanyahu, who considers peace as an existential threat, some are opposed to any agreement, regardless of its content.""Educated in the United States himself, the Iranian foreign minister did not shy away from showing his own constitutional chops, intimating that the Republican Senators who signed onto the letter may not been fully conversant with the United States Constitution. To this end, Zarif said, ""A change of administration does not in any way relieve the next administration from international obligations undertaken by its predecessor in a possible agreement about Iran's peaceful nuclear program.""  Zarif also noted that a move by a future president to dismantle a yet-to-be-achieved nuclear agreement would be in contravention to international jurisprudence, saying, ""I wish to enlighten the authors that if the next administration revokes any agreement with the stroke of a pen, as they boast, it will have simply committed a blatant violation of international law.""To be sure, the letter from the 47 Republican senators emphasized the view that any deal would have to be ratified by the upper house of the Congress.  However, both Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif and United States Secretary of State John Kerry pointed out that the vast majority of international agreements forged in recent decades have been  executive measures and not treaties requiring ratification by the Senate.Moreover, any deal emerging from the nuclear talk would be neither a bilateral agreement nor a conventional treaty between nation state.  Instead, it would be a multilateral accord, forged by the P5+1 countries, including all permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. The accord would likely activated as a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, then sealed under the aegis of the United Nations Security Council, and thus would in fact not be subject to modification by Congress. In this regard, it would be follow on the heels of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1696, 1737, 1747, 1803, 1835, and 1929 that have also dealt with Iran's nuclear program.  Neither a Republican-controlled Senate  nor a future president would be positioned to unilaterally  reverse the terms of a potential accord of this sort.Congress, with its power of the purse, could certainly  place certain limits on President Obama or any future president as regards sanctions to be levied upon Iran (or any other country).  However, Congress cannot summarily override international obligations forged in a multilateral frame, and which would be structured as an international measure, without  being in  flagrant breach of international law.Beyond the legal perils at stake, there were political perils to consider. The fact of the matter was that any post-Obama president would be placed in a precarious position within the world community for violating an agreement reached and understood as a matter of international consensus.Meanwhile, there were rumblings in regards to violations of domestic law when some observers noted that the letter to Iran could be regarded as a violation of the 18th century Logan Act.To be precise, the Logan Act prohibits any ""Private correspondence with foreign governments"" and reads; ""Any citizen of the United States, wherever he may be, who, without authority of the United States, directly or indirectly commences or carries on any correspondence or intercourse with any foreign government or any officer or agent thereof, with intent to influence the measures or conduct of any foreign government or of any officer or agent thereof, in relation to any disputes or controversies with the United States, or to defeat the measures of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.""  In truth, it was unlikely that a law dating back to 1799 would be used to prosecute the 47 senators; however, its discussion has only added to the level of scandal and drama surrounding a potential landmark multilateral agreement on Iran's nuclear program.Returning to the issue of the prevailing nuclear negotiations -- the fact of the matter was that nuclear talks continued in Switzerland in the third week of March 2015. The principal parties acknowledged that progress was being made, particularly with regard to technical provisions.  Ali Akbar Salehi, the head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, expressed delight over his productive meetings with United States Energy Secretary Earnest Moniz, saying, ""We have made progress on technical issues. One or two issues remain and need to be discussed.""  For his part, Secretary of State Kerry said, ""We're pushing some tough issues but we made progress.""However, other Western representatives had a different view. A State Department official told Reuters News, ""We are pretty far away. There are a lot of issues that still need to be resolved. The Iranians must make substantial concessions.""  Moreover, as reported by Reuters News, an anonymous European negotiator said: ""Contrary to what the Iranians are saying with regard to 90 percent of an accord being done, that's not correct.  We are not close to an agreement.""Clearly, another round of talks was anticipated to resolve a slate of remaining issues.  Of note was the West's insistence that Iran's nuclear activities be curtailed and its nuclear breakout time be circumscribed to one year.  Stated differently, an arrangement had to be made whereby Iran would need a full year to garner enough fissile material (either high enriched uranium or plutonium before it could produce a nuclear weapon.  On the agenda for discussion was a plan to limit the  number of enrichment centrifuges Iran would be allowed to keep; other considerations included limits of the size of uranium stockpiles.Note that on March 21, 2015, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani indicated that progress was being made in nuclear talks, setting the stage for a final deal.  He was quoted by Iranian state media as saying. ""There is nothing that cannot be resolved.""  Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, however, emitted a very different tone from that of Iran's more moderate president, Rouhani. In reference to President Obama's Persian Nowruz message to the Iranian people, in which the United State leader said a deal on Iran's nuclear program presented ""an historic opportunity to resolve this issue peacefully,""  Ayatollah  Khamenei  said that his country should not submit to the demands of the global powers. Khamenei noted, ""Basically, what he [Obama]  says in his message is that you must accept the terms we dictate in the nuclear talks so that jobs, investment, and economic activities will blossom in your country... this view will never lead to any conclusions for us.""  In many senses, Obama and Rouhani were in similar positions -- both were pragmatic presidents, both were eager to improve bilateral relations between their countries, while meeting global security goals, yet both men were also politically at odds with the conservative and hardline elements in their own countries.Days later, the landscape for negotiations could only be understood as uncertain.  The various sides appeared to be deadlocked over certain sticking points. France was looking for more stringent restrictions on the Iranians -- a position by France that was at odds with the other P5+1 countries.  Also at issue was the fact that France was not keen on the notion of a quick suspension to United Nations sanctions against Iran -- a demand being made by the Iranians.  Meanwhile, the United States was advocating that restrictions on Iranian nuclear work should be in place for at least 10 years, while France was looking for a 15 year timeline, along with 10 years of rigorous IAEA monitoring. Other contentions centered on Iran's demand that it be allowed unfettered research and development of advanced centrifuges, which are used to enrich uranium for use in nuclear reactors, and ultimately are linked with weapons production.Negotiations in mid-March 2015 abruptly ended when the Iranian delegation announced they were returning to Tehran because President Hassan Rouhani's 90-year-old mother had died.  The break in negotiations was not being regarded as problematic; instead, all sides seemed to agree that talks would resume at the end of March 2015.The fact of the matter was that  significant issues remained unresolved with Iran and the P5+1 countries far apart in some regards.  Still, the consequences of not reaching a deal would likely destablize the world; as such, the impetus for forging an agreement was strong and all expectations were that the March 2015 deadline would be extended again to give the negotiations process further time and space.  For all the players, the March 30, 2015, deadline to reach a political framework agreement was not one to be held in stone.  Instead, they were looking at the June 30, 2015, deadline for a final deal as being more pertinent.Broken negotiations or breakthrough deal?At the end of March 2015,  the P5+1 multilateral talks with Iran were set to end, with all eyes on a framework for a long term agreement.  But the negotiations were mired by various sticking points, prompting the parties to extend the negotiating process.At issue were freshly emerging objections by Iran to the notion that it would ship its enriched uranium out of the country, where it would be unavailable for potential weaponization purposes.  Since a potential Iranian nuclear deal has -- for years -- rested on this provision, Iran's insistence that its enriched uranium reside in Iranian possession could be an unresolvable obstacle in the negotiations process.  Meanwhile, the other unresolved issues (discussed above) -- from  the pace of lifting sanctions to strict monitoring restrictions --continued to pose challenges.  One Iranian negotiator, Majid Takhteravanchi, signaled some intransigence as he said in an interview with the  Iranian Fars news agency that the lifting of sanctions on Iranian terms was essential.  He said, ""There will be no agreement if the sanctions issue cannot be resolved. This issue is very important for us.""Still, the P5+1 parties agreed to continue the conversation.  As noted by United States Secretary of State John Kerry, ""There still remain some difficult issues. We are working very hard to work those through.""  Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov sounded an optimistic note, saying that the chance of resolving the issues was high.  He said, ""The chances are high. They are probably not 100 percent but you can never be 100 percent certain of anything. The odds are quite doable  if none of the parties raise the stakes at the last minute."" Of course, the Iranians' objections to the removal of its enriched uranium could well be regarded as ""raising the stakes at the last minute.""Lengthy and difficult talks continued at the Beau-Rivage Ralace hotel in the Swiss city of Lausanne. The March 31, 2015, ""soft"" or self-imposed deadline actually passed, with all parties set on extending the negotiations.  All eyes were now focused on the first week of April 2015 as a new target date to forge consensus on the structure of a final accord.On April 2, 2015, after marathon talks in Switzerland, the P5+1 countries and Iran issued a joint statement announcing that the hard work of negotiations and diplomacy had yielded results, and that a historic framework agreement on Iran's nuclear program had been reached.  As stated by the European Union foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini,  ""We have reached solutions on key parameters of a joint comprehensive plan of action.""The terms of the agreement would ensure that a longer time horizon -- of one year -- needed by Iran  to enrich enough uranium for one nuclear weapon. This breakout period of one year would be held in place for a decade.  Of note was the fact that Iran's existing breakout time was estimated to be only two months.The agreement would reduce the number of installed centrifuges from around the 19,000 Iran currently  has in its possession to 6,000;  all the centrifuges would be the less efficient  first-generation IR-1 enrichment models  while newer-model centrifuges would be out of commission.  Of those 6,000 centrifuges, about 5,000 would be allowed to enrich uranium for 10 years. The remaining centrifuges would be moved to storage and controlled by the United Nations'  nuclear watchdog group, the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).The joint comprehensive plan of action would also ensure that Iran's actual stockpile of uranium would be reduced from 10,000 kilograms of low-enriched uranium to 300 kilograms along a 15-year time horizon. As well,  Iran would cease construction on new uranium enrichment facilities for a 15-year period.Also central to the joint comprehensive plan of action were provisions to curtail Iran's enrichment facilities to the Natanz nuclear site, and convert the nuclear facilities at Fordo and Arak for purely research purposes.According to a fact sheet from the Government of the United States, Iran would gain sanctions relief only if it ""verifiably abides by its commitments."" That sanctions relief would apply to those nuclear-related measures introduced by the United States and the European Union and not include sanctions related to terrorism and human rights abuses.  There would be a ""snap back"" measure so that the sanctions could be re-imposed  if Iran was not compliant with the provisions of the deal.Also at stake would be prevailing United Nations Security Council resolutions on Iran's nuclear activities.  A new resolution would be introduced that would hold in place certain key provisions  relevant to ""sensitive"" nuclear activities, while also addressing the new measures outlined above.A rigorous program of verification would remain in place  to  corroborate Iran's adherence to the terms of the agreement  and to ensure that Iran meets its obligations.  For example, Iran would have to provide the IAEA with unfettered access to its nuclear facilities, uranium mines, and  centrifuge storage facilities, ensuring the IAEA inspectors could investigate any suspicious sites or covert activities.In an interview with Radio Free Europe, Kelsey Davenport, the director for Nonproliferation Policy at the Arms Control Association, explained that the non-proliferation parameters of the agreement were ""very strong.""  Davenport said, ""This deal effectively blocks Iran's pathways to a weapon using both uranium and plutonium, and it puts in place stringent monitoring and verification to ensure that any deviation from the agreement or any covert program will be immediately detected.""Mark Fitzpatrick, the director of the Nonproliferation and Disarmament Program at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, came to a similar conclusion.  In his interview with Radio Free Europe that the agreement would result in a rigid nuclear verification regime.  Fitzpatrick explained that under the verification infrastructure, violations of the agreement at any point along the ""supply chain"" would be easy to discern.  He said, ""It would be detected very quickly if Iran were to use any of its declared facilities.  If Iran were to try to hide something, that would also very likely be detected because this deal -- the parameters -- include a lot of verification measures that go beyond the normal IAEA monitoring.""The successful framework agreement reached on April 2, 2015, marked a massive breakthrough in the realm of international diplomacy for the purpose of global security.The agreement  presaged a long-term deal, which would have to be made by the final ""hard""  deadline on June 30, 2015.  The prevailing question continued to dominate:  Can a final accord on Iran's nuclear program be forged?  The answer to that question remained the same at the time of writing:  It was yet to be determined if the nuclear negotiations would actually end in a viable and enduring deal.Political Complications:In the initial aftermath of the framework announcement, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani vowed that his country would abide by the terms of the agreement, saying in a national address, ""The world must know that we do not intend to cheat.""  He warned of consequences if the partner states did not do their own part, saying, ""If the other side acts on its promises, Iran will abide by its promises. If, however, they one day decide to follow a different path, our nation too will be always free to make [another] choice.""On the other side of the Atlantic, United States President Barack Obama was set to embark on a political campaign of sorts, as he hoped to persuade skeptical members of Congress that the Iranian nuclear deal was the best way of ensuring Iran did not develop a nuclear weapon.  But he was immediately stymied by Israeli  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu  who concluded that the deal  needed additional measures included, such as  a ""clear and unambiguous Iranian recognition of Israel's right to exist.""The Obama  administration, though, noted that the purpose of the agreement was carefully circumscribed to deal with preventing Iran from gaining a nuclear weapon. President Obama himself entered the equation, insisting that  the framework agreement would be good for global security, as it would ""cut off every pathway that Iran could take to develop a nuclear weapon.""  He added, ""We will be able to resolve one of the greatest threats to our security and to do so peacefully.""  It was to be seen if Obama would gain concurrence in the United States Congress, or, if hardliners would be able to cull together a veto-proof majority to force the president of the United States to seek Congressional approval of the deal.An additional complication was emanating from Iran itself, as that country demanded  immediate sanctions relief as part of the agreement.  To be precise, Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said that not only would all sanctions  have to be lifted on the day any deal is signed, but that military sites would be not be open to international nuclear inspectors. Clearly, immediate sanctions relief was not part of the blueprint unveiled on April 2, 2015, while a rigorous program of verification stood as the bulwark of the very deal.  As such, the Ayatollah's statements  raised questions as to whether or not a viable agreement was actually on the table.Another challenge was presented in the form of Russia's decision to lift a ban on missile deliveries to Iran while commencing an oil-for-goods exchange.  These moves were  being met with concern from the Obama White House in the United States.  For Russia, though, it was evident that the plan was to immediately reap economic benefits from the cessation of sanctions against Iran.United States Secretary of State John Kerry was expected to bring up the subject for discussion with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov.Secretary of State Kerry, meanwhile, had his hands full at home in the United States, as he lobbied members of Congress to hold off on any legislation that might curtail his abilities to forge a solid final nuclear deal by the June 30, 2015, deadline mentioned above.  At issue was the fact that hardliners in Congress have been eager to enter the realm of foreign relations, and force any deal signed by the president to be subject to review by the legislative branch of government.  While Congress' hand could not stop the president from signing onto the deal being negotiated, the president would still have to gain cooperation from Congress to modify the sanctions regime against Iran. President Obama has made clear that he would veto moves intended to blunt or undermine the ability of his administration to negotiate  a final deal with the Iranians.The reality, however, was that President Obama could well be could be faced with a veto-proof super majority of bipartisan senators, who could conceivably impact his administration's negotiations.  As such, Secretary of State Kerry, along with reasury Secretary Jack Lew and Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, were  eager to assure Republicans and Democrats of the substance of the agreement, and gain their cooperation in allowig him more time to finalize an acceptable nuclear deal with Iran.  Ahead of these key meetings with legislators, Kerry said, ""We hope Congress will listen carefully ... but also give us some space so we will be able to complete a very difficult task.""Note that on April 14, 2015, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee crafted a compromise bill that include a modest review period of 30 days for a final Iran nuclear deal.  The bill would also specify that sanctions relief  would be dependent on  an end to Iran's support for terrorism, but it would do so in more malleable language.  It seemed that the committee was hoping to avoid a showdown with the executive branch of government.  President Obama made it known that he would support the compromise legislation in this new form.  According to White House spokesperson Josh Earnest, the president was ""not thrilled"" with the bill; however, he concluded that the new proposal was a more acceptable measure.  It was conceivable that the White House could change its stance if objectionable amendments were attached to the compromise bill. The bill passed by the committee and would be taken up by the full Senate.Meanwhile, the negotiations process was ongoing, with a new round of talks between Iran and the P5+1 powers resuming in the last week of  April 2015.  United States  Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged that serious differences remained between Iran and the global powers, but added that they were nonetheless closer than ever to forging a sustainable agreement with Iran.  Secretary of State Kerry said,  ""We are, in fact, closer than ever to the good, comprehensive deal that we have been seeking, and if we can get there, the entire world will be safer."" He added, ""If finalized and implemented, (an agreement) will close off all of Iran's possible pathways to the nuclear material required for a nuclear weapon and give the international community the confidence that it needs to know that Iran's nuclear program is indeed exclusively peaceful.""At the start of May 2015, those negotiations concluded, with emphasis on key sticking points --  namely the re-imposition of United Nations sanctions, should Iran violate the agreement, and the potential purchase of nuclear technology' known as a ""procurement channel.""  The sanctions issue was being regarded as a particularly challenging one, with concerns centering on crafting parameters that would allow for the automatic re-imposition of  United Nations sanctions (referred to as""snapback"" provision),  thus by-passing the potential hazard of a veto by either China or Russia.  Western negotiators have made it clear that without the implementation of a snapback mechanism, there would be no final Iranian nuclear deal.  Meanwhile, the procurement channel issue was being taken seriously, given the United Kingdom's report to the United Nations on a spurious Iranian nuclear procurement network, which was linked  with two blacklisted companies.A fresh round of negotiations commenced in Austria in mid-May 2015.Recent Nuclear Negotiations DevelopmentsAs May 2015 came to a close, the six P5-1 international powers were able to reach an agreement aimed at restoring United Nations sanctions if Iran was found to be in non-compliance  a complex issue as intimated just above.Under the agreement, suspected breaches by Iran would be addressed by a  dispute-resolution panel.  As well,  with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) monitoring Iran's nuclear program, IAEA reports would be used to assess compliance.  If Iran was found to be  in violation of the terms of the deal, then United Nations sanctions would effectively be ""snapped"" back into place.The ""snapback"" provision meant that a significant hurdle had been crossed in reaching a comprehensive nuclear deal with Iran.Still,  Iran had to concur with this measure for the deal to go forward, and  Iran was itself suggesting that it would immediately resume its nuclear activities if the six P5-1 international powers  did not meet their own obligations under the terms of the deal.Moving forward, there was more diplomatic work to be done regarding access to sensitive Iranian military sites in order to verify Iran's compliance with the new nuclear development parameters.Of particular concern was the matter of the inspection of non-nuclear sites and military installations in  Iran, presumably to ensure no clandestine nuclear operations were taking place in violation of the terms of any future permanent agreement.  Iran has been cold to the idea of inspections to such facilities while France has threatened to block anyfinal nuclear settlement without a provision for that type of intrusive inspections regime.The start of June 2015 was marked by the resumption of negotiations between the six P5-1 international powers and the Iranian delegation in Austria. Of note was the  absence of United States Secretary of State John Kerry  as he recovered from a broken leg; however,  the talks went on with  United States negotiator Wendy Sherman representing the interests of her country.The June 30, 2015, deadline loomed ahead for a final and sustainable agreement to be reached on Iran's nuclear program.The challenge of the task was aptly described by Iran's deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi , who was quoted as saying in an interview with Iranian media, ""There has been progress but still we have a difficult way ahead of us.""By mid-June 2015, all reports from Vienna in Austria were that the nuclear talks between  the delegations from Iran and the six P5-1 international powers had stalled and, as such,  the deadline for the final agreement might have to be pushed past June 30, 2015.  Indeed, with only days to go until that deadline, it was announced that nuclear negotiations  between Iran and the six P5-1 international powers would extend beyond June 30, 2015.  There were reports that Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif  was heading home to Tehran -- quite likely for discussions with the government in Iran regarding the difficult final status issues, such as access to IAEA nuclear monitors and  the timing of sanctions relief.At the start of July 2015,  Iran and the six P5-1 international powers  remained deadlocked and a breakthrough had not been made in the negotiations process.  However, representatives from the various delegations noted that progress was being made, and that the ""bones"" of a final agreement were slowly taking shape.  As indicated above,  particular sticking points included the matter of sanctions relief and the inspections and monitoring of Iranian compliance.  That latter issue took on greater relevance when Iran's Ayatollah  Ali Khamenei declared that there would be no sustained freeze of sensitive nuclear development, and that  military sites would not be open to inspectors.  This absolutist stance by Iran's Supreme Leader could potentially upend the deal that so many diplomats had worked diligently to forge.Still, the diplomatic work continued with all parties suggesting that a final agreement might be advanced by  a new deadline of  July 7, 2015.In an interview with the media, United States Secretary of State John Kerry indicated that a deal was possible in that timeframe as he said, ""If hard choices get made in the next couple of days and made quickly, we could get agreement this week.""  But Kerry also acknowledged that negotiations had not yet yielded breakthrough results on the key technical issues, as he added that Iran and the  six P5-1 international powers  were ""not where we need to be on several of the most difficult issues.""  If no progress was made with Iran on those matters, then the United States was ready to walk away -- regardless of the herculean effort to date in the negotiating arena.That deadline of June 7, 2015 was extended  yet again and negotiations were set to continue with negotiators looking for a final deal.  The new goal was to reach a nuclear agreement by mid-July 2015.In the days leading up to the middle of July 2015, Iran accused the West of complicating the negotiations process by introducing new demands, while countries of the West warned that progress was now slow and difficult.  There were also reports of loud arguments between Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif and United States Secretary of State Kerry.For his part, Secretary of State Kerry was signaling that he would be prepared to walk away from the negotiating table as he said, ""We can't wait forever. If the tough decisions don't get made, we are absolutely prepared to call an end to this.""  On the other side of the equation,  Iran responded bitterly with Iranian Envoy Ali Akbar Velayati referring to  Kerry's  statement as ""part of America's psychological warfare against Iran.""But by July 12, 2015, tensions were calming and there were reports that the foundations of an agreement were emerging.  To this end,  Secretary of State Kerry suggested progress was being made as he said,  ""I think we're getting to some real decisions.""  French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius offered a similar mesage as he said: ""I hope we are finally entering the final phase of these marathon negotiations. I believe it.""In the early hours of July 14, 2015,  reported were emerging that a final deal was in the works.  some elements of the final deal were being leaked in the public sphere.  Those elements of the nuclear draft included provisions for the United Nations  inspectors to have access to all suspicious Iranian nuclear sites, including military compounds.The agreement would also have to be adopted by the United Nations  Security Council in the form of a  resolution, and then the the work on limiting and regulating Iran's nuclear activities, as well as the measured related to  sanctions relief,  would be put into effect in 2016.Final Iran Nuclear Deal Reached:On July 14, 2015, Iran and the so-called P5+1 world powers officially reached a historic accord on Iran's controversial nuclear program.  The accord was formally announced in the Austrian capital of Vienna where the final slate of difficult negotiations had taken place.  As presaged in the previous sections of this report, the agreement would limit Iran's nuclear activity and development, essentially preventing the production of a nuclear bomb.  The agreement was also aimed at extending Iran's nuclear weapons ""breakout"" time from its current timeline of  a month to a year.The deal was not intended to address issues related to state-sponsorship of terrorism or human rights abuses. In exchange, the West would lift its international oil and financial sanctions imposed on Iran.In a separate but related development, Iran and the the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) -- the  world's nuclear watchdog entity --  said they had signed a roadmap to resolve outstanding issues. Already, under the aegis of the 2013 interim temporary accord, the IAEA verified that Iran had eliminated its known stockpiles of 20 percent enriched uranium.  This 20 percent grade uranium can be used  (1) to produce medical isotopes and  (2) to fuel research reactors,  but (3) it  can also be  purified to weapons-grade levels.  The IAEA has already verified that Iran met this demand dating back to 2013.Central elements of the final deal were as follows --  Iran would reduce its enriched-uranium stockpile by 98 percent-  Iran would retain a reduced number of uranium centrifuges (5060 in total) for a ten-year period-  Iran would be limited to refining uranium  at only a five percent enrichment level for a fifteen-year period( this level is consistent for usage at a nuclear power plant and is well short of weaponization levels )-  Iran will allow IAEA monitors to inspect facilities under review for suspicious activity for up to 25 years( Iran does not have to submit to inspections but if it refuses it will be subject to an arbitration panel and possible judgement that it is in violation)-  Iran would be granted gradual/phased in  sanctions relief, essentially allowing Iran to finally export its oil-  Iran would be granted access to more than $100 billion in frozen assets pending the implementation of nuclear curbs-  The prevailing United Nations arms embargo on Iran would  remain in place for five years-  The prevailing  ballistic missiles embargo on Iran would  remain in place for eight years_  Iran would be prohibited from  designing warheads or conducting experiments on nuclear weapons-related technologyThe complete  implementation of the provisions of the deal would be contingent on Iran's commitment  to meeting its obligations to curtail its nuclear program and satisfy the world's concerns over the  possible military dimensions of its  nuclear development activity.  To this end,  a breach of the terms of the accord by Iran would generate a ""snapback"" provision, essentially snapping highly punitive sanctions back into place.United States President Barack Obama touted the agreement as a good one, noting the following:""This deal meets every single one of the bottom lines that we established when we achieved a framework this spring. Every pathway to a nuclear weapon is cut off, and the inspection and transparency regime necessary to verify that objective will be put in place.""President Obama also noted that the deal would make the world ""safer and more secure.""  He additionally addressed his critics  saying that the terms of thee agreement  provided for a rigorous verification regime.He added, ""This deal is not built on trust -- it is built on verification.""  Furthermore, the president emphasized  that there would be immediate consequences if Iran was found to be in violation of the terms of the agreement, as he said, ""If Iran violates the deal, all these sanctions will snap back into place.""For his part, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani hailed the accord, saying that  the prayers of Iranians had ""come true.""  Rouhani -- who was being celebrated in the streets of Tehran as a hero -- said the deal opened a ""new chapter"" in Iran's relationship with the rest of the international community.  But the Iranian leader was also realistic in his assessment of the agreement, noting that it was ""not perfect,""  but that it was the ""best achievement possible that could be reached.""United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon championed the pact finalized in Vienna, casting it to be  ""historic,"" and paid tribute to the onerous and difficult work of diplomacy, which he said was  a ""testament to the value of dialogue."" The United Nations chief conveyed his hopes that  the deal would contribute to ""a greater mutual understanding and cooperation on the many serious security challenges in the Middle East.""A similar view came from Federica Mogherini, the  European Union foreign policy chief,  as she expressed satisfaction with the final accord.  She said, ""This is a sign of hope for the entire world. And we all know this is very much needed in these times.""Even with the formal announcement of this historic nuclear  agreement, the process was not over.  There would have to be a vote at the United Nations Security Council.  As well, the deal would still have to find concurrence in the capital cities of Tehran, Washington D.C., London, Paris, Berlin, Moscow, and Beijing where it would face the challenges of hardline domestic politics.Hinting towards the Republicans' opposition would have to any agreement forged by the Obama administration in the United States, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in an interview with Fox News,  ""I think it's going to be a very hard sell, if it's completed, in Congress. We already know it's going to leave Iran as a threshold nuclear state."" Upon hearing the announcement of the landmark deal, and before actually reading the details of the agreement, Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives, John Boehner, denounced the deal, declaring that it would  only ""embolden"" Iran.  He said, ""Instead of stopping the spread of nuclear weapons in the Middle East, this deal is likely to fuel a nuclear arms race around the world.""  But perhaps the most vituperative feedback came from Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas who pugnaciously suggested military consequences for Iran as follows: ""Iran is an anti-American, terrorism-sponsoring outlaw regime. Iran should have faced a simple choice: they dismantle their nuclear program entirely, or they face economic devastation and military destruction of their nuclear facilities.""Clearly, Republicans in the United States Congress, helped by certain factions of Democrats, would do their part to resist, curtail, and even halt the United States' participation in the agreement.  To this end, under a special arrangement made with the president, they would have 60 days to consider the Iranian agreement in Congress and either sanction or reject it.Note:  Because the Iranian nuclear deal was not a formal treaty between the United States and Iran, there was actually no need for a ratification vote by two-thirds of the Senate.  However, in the interests of some degree of national consensus on so sensitive a subject as Iran's nuclear ambitions,  the United States Congress and President Obama agreed to an arrangement by which legislators would be allowed to either approve or reject the agreement by a simple majority.Since Republicans controlled both Houses of Congress, it was highly likely they would be successful in their efforts to defeat the accord.  However, President Obama would himself have the opportunity to veto any legislation passed in Congress that aimed to kill the deal.  Warning Republicans and their Democratic allies of this course of action, President Obama said,  ""So I will veto any legislation that prevents the successful implementation of this deal. We do not have to accept an inevitable spiral into conflict. And we certainly shouldn't seek it. And precisely because the stakes are so high this is not the time for politics or posturing. Tough talk from Washington does not solve problems.""In Iran,  despite the positive reception by pro-Rouhani  and other moderate elements, the agreement was guaranteed to spark the antagonism of hardliners and conservatives.  As expected, Iranian hardliners and conservatives immediately launched their opposition campaign to the nuclear deal, with even  Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warning that  some of the world powers that signed on to the agreement were ""untrustworthy.""  In this way, there was no guarantee that Iran's Supreme Leader Khamenei would ""bless"" the deal.In the United States, there was a parallel process of opposition and acrimony unfolding as hardliners and conservatives warned that Iran would find ways to cheat and violate the terms of the agreement.Of particular concern to United States lawmakers was the provision allowing Iran 24 days before allowing nuclear inspectors into suspect Iranian military sites, with many of them complaining that the length of time would allow Iran to cover its tracks were it to carry out clandestine nuclear activities  at these sites.However, nuclear experts have noted that current technology would be able to detect traces of sustances used for nuclear development activities, making it impossible for Iran to actually hide any ""bad behavior.""As noted by the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Yukiya Amano: ""We are confident we can detect any diversion or misuse of nuclear material in a timely manner.""There were also objections to the lifting of sanctions and access to frozen assets, which could be used to fund rogue actors across the world.  However, even if the United States held in place its own unilateral sanctions against Iran, the other world powers were eager to end the sanctions regime against Iran.  Thus, the United States would be left isolated in its effort to keep the sanctions pressure on Iran.In Israel, which has been adamantly against an agreement with Israel, the response was rapid and bitter.  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cast the deal as a ""stunning historic mistake.""  He also noted  that sanctions relief  would provide Iran with ""hundreds of billions of dollars with which it can fuel its terror machine and its expansion and aggression throughout the Middle East and across the globe.""  Netanyahu also made clear that Israel had no intention of abiding with the agreement -- regardless of its eventual enshrinement as a United Nations Security Council Resolution -- as he warned, """"We will always defend ourselves.""But the objective arbiters of the agreement expressed cautious optimism over the successful negotiations process.Yukiya Amano, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) -- the world's nucear watchdog entity -- said that the landmark nuclear agreement  constituted a ""significant step forward,""  and noted that now the IAEA would be better positioned to""make an assessment of issues relating to possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear program by the end of 2015.""As well, the conservative publication, The Economist, made the following conclusion:  ""The concern of critics of Barack Obama, both in Washington and beyond, was that the president's perceived desperation to burnish his legacy with an historic deal would result in dangerous compromises surrendered at the last minute to the wily Iranians. However, that was never likely (Iran's need for a deal has always been much greater than America's) and it is not borne out by the details of what has appears to have been agreed... But judged by more pragmatic standards, the deal, while not perfect, appears much better than any of the plausible alternatives.""Ellie Geranmayeh, a policy fellow at the European Council of Foreign Relations,  gave  the agreement fulsome praise, declaring, ""This is probably going to go down in history as one of the biggest diplomatic successes of the century.""It should be noted that nuclear nonproliferation experts have largely endorsed this agreement.  As reported by Max Fisher at Vox.com regarding an interview with  Aaron Stein, a nuclear nonproliferation expert at the Royal United Services Institute, the Iranian nuclear deal  ""exceeds in all areas."" Under this agreement, according to Stein, if Iran were to attempt to build a bomb, ""the likelihood of getting caught is near 100 percent.""  He added,  ""It makes the possibility of Iran developing a nuclear weapon in the next 25 years extremely remote.""  Stein explained his assessment further as follows: "" I think the U.S. hand is actually strengthened in this, to be honest with you. A full accounting of where everything is [gleaned from invasive inspections and monitoring] is a wonderful targeting mechanism for the Pentagon. If we know where all of their stuff is, you can make far more accurate, detailed maps about where to put a cruise missile. Iran knows what it's doing going into this. They know the consequences if they screw up here, and the provisions are very tight, the inspection regime is very robust. The likelihood of getting caught is near 100 percent.  The consequences are far more than just having your sites bombed. It's that they will have reneged on the agreement that basically the whole world supports, except for the Republicans and the Israelis and the Saudis.""United Nations Security Council lifts sanctions on Iran:Going forward, the United Nations Security Council would have to adopt a resolution that would lift international sanctions related to Iran's nuclear program.  Of course, as has been discussed here, the sanctions  would be subject to the so-called ""snapback"" provision and could be re-imposed if Iran was deemed to be in violation of the new accord.  A vote at the United Nations Security Council ws expected to occur early as the third week in July 2015.  To that end, United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, said she would submit the draft resolution on behalf of the P5+1 world powers and the European Union, which would then be taken up for a vote.That vote on a resolution endorsing the agreement was set to take place during the following week.  Since the veto-wielding permanent  members of the  United Nations Security Council  were all parties to the negotiations, there was no doubt that the resolution would be adopted.Indeed, on July 20, 2015, the United Nations Security Council unanimously approved a resolution endorsing the Iranian nuclear deal, thus clearing the path for sanctions imposed since 2006 to be lifted.  The United Nations Security Council  also enshrined its nuclear watchdog agency,the International Atomic Energy Agency,  with the authority to ""undertake the necessary verification and monitoring of Iran's nuclear commitments.""Other measures would have to be undertaken by various governments.  Primarily, Iran's  parliament would have to  review  and ratify the agreement, which was reported to have been ""blessed"" by Supreme Leader  Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.At the start of September 2015, Khamenei returned to the political purview in Iran to say that he favored a parliamentary vote on its nuclear deal.  To this end, Khamenei said,  ""Parliament should not be sidelined on the nuclear deal issue ... I am not saying lawmakers should ratify or reject the deal. It is up to them to decide.""While Khamenei has neither opposed nor endorsed the agreement, his praise of the diplomatic process has been interpreted by some observers as a tacit blessing of sorts.  It was to be seen if an actual vote would ensue in the Iranian Majlis, however, President Rouhani's government had not yet even advanced legislation for members of parliament to consider.A similar process would have to ensue in the United States where the Republican-led Congress would have 60 days to review and ratify the agreement, but where it was more likely to be rejected.  The fight in the United States would be to secure enough votes to maintain a presidential veto.Note on Political Landscape in the United States --As discussed above,  if the United States Congress was able to disapprove of the Iranian nuclear deal, President Obama would enact his veto authority. The main question would be whether or not there was enough support in Congress to override a presidential veto.  (In the Senate and the House of Representatives, there would have to be a 2/3 super-majority in each of the two chambers to vitiate a presidential veto.)  Of note was the fact that even a vote to ""disapprove"" of the nuclear deal by the United States Congress would do little to actually upend the agreement since a United Nations Security Council  resolution had already approved it in the realm of international jurisprudence.Assuming the United States president's veto would be enough to halt Republicans' objections to the deal, there would be few options left for hardline conservatives determined to kill any agreement with Iran.One of the remaining courses of action for Republicans would be for them to capture the White House in 2016.  Then, with a new administration at the helm in 2017, the new president could conceivably begin the process of scapping the accord and re-imposing sanctions against Iran.  But that would be a unilateral pathway unlikely to gain support from the other P5+1 countries, whose diplomats also worked hard to forge this pact, and who were not eager to see military engagement with Iran.Moreover, by 2017, most of the pressing sanctions would have been removed anyway, and the re-imposition of them promised to be a herculean task.  As noted by the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Republican Senator Bob Corker,  ""The next president can start from scratch.  What would have happened, though, is the international sanctions process would have been totally dismantled.""In the six weeks following the decision by the United Nations Security Council to lift its sanctions against Iran,  groups hostile to the Iranian nuclear agreement launched an aggressive and expensive advertising campaign  intent on securing enough support to kill the deal.  As well, Israeli Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu repeated his dire warnings of geopolitical calamity sure to visit the Middle East were the deal to go forward.  But even as these forces placed their own pressure on lawmakers in the United States, the Obama administration was busy are work trying to rally support for the deal in Congress.The main argument from the White House was that the agreement accomplished its objective of preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.  As stated by President Obama himself, the agreement eliminates ""every pathway to a nuclear weapon"" for Iran.With most of the Democratic representatives in the lower chamber in relatively safe seats, and since many of them already shared the president's internationalist foreign policy, there was a sense of confidence that House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi would be able to bring together enough Democratic votes to deny the House Republicans the 2/3 majority needed to uphold a disapproval measure.  The real action was in the Senate where some Democrats, such as Senator Charles Schumer of New York, and Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, had already signalled their skepticism regarding the Iranian nuclear deal, and as exepected, ultimately opted to vote to disapprove of the accord.Since a total of 34 votes would be needed to deny the Republican-led Senate their 2/3 majority, the job of gaining support for President Obama's Iran agenda would be difficult, and the final tally was expected to be tight.But on Sept. 2, 2015, President Obama secured the support of 34 Democratic senators regarding the Iranian deal, effectively foreclosing any sgnificant action from the Republicans to stymie the United States' full participation in the landmark Iranian nuclear curtailment deal.Most of the senators  expressed similar sentiment, noting that no deal was perfect, that the Iranians were not be trusted, but that the  Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (the legislative title for the Iranian nuclear deal as it is discussed and debated in the Congress) was the best available option to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear bomb.  As noted by United States Secretary of State John Kerry, who did the strenuous work of vigorous diplomacy to make the deal a reality, ""The benefits of this agreement far outweigh any potential drawbacks.""The disapproval resolution related to  the  Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action  would be on the legislative agenda for debate when members of Congress returned to the Capitol in Washington D.C. after the August recess on Sept. 8, 2015.  A vote was expected  later in the month when the resolution would be presumably be passed, and then be subject to a presidential veto.On the United States political landscape, there remained a small possibility in the Senate that the disapproval resolution would not even be voted on if Democrats in the upper chamber were able to hold together 41 votes to sustain a filibuster, thus preventing a vote of cloture cutting off debate.  In such a case, the bill would not be able to be brought to the floor for a full vote and President Obama would not have to use his veto power.  While all expectations were that there would, in fact, be a full vote where the bill would be approved, the landscape changed on Sept. 8, 2015, when the Democratic tally was complete.  On that day, it was clear that42 senators had opted to support the deal -- more than the 34 needed to sustain a veto but also more than the 41 needed to filibuster the bill from even going to a vote on the floor of the Senate.  Still to be determined was the matter of whether or not at least  41 senators would be willing to go down the filibuster path.That question was answered on Sept. 10, 2015, when Democrats in the Senate delivered a major victory to President Obama by successfully holding together 42 votes to filibuster the disapproval resolution, thus denying a vote on the legislation.All 42 Democratic senators who had expressed support for the nuclear agreement stood in solidarity on the procedural vote after several hours of debate, effectively preventing the bill from even going to a vote, and thus insulating the president from having to exercise his veto authority.Meanwhile, in the House of Representatives, the Republican leadership was trying to alter its political calculus related to the disapproval resoluton by dividing it up into three separate bills, in the hopes that it would delay -- if not outright stop -- the nuclear deal from going into effect. Now, one measure centered on the claim that President Obama  did not comply with the Iran nuclear review act; a second measure was a motion of approval of the nuclear deal; the third measure sought to prevent President  Obama from waiving sanctions against Iran. All three pieces of legislation were cleared for debate, where they were expected to pass due to the fact that Republicans controlled the lower chamber.  However,  the fate of the Iranian  nuclear deal was no longer in doubt  given the outcome in the Senate.The political victory for President Obama at home in the United States ensured that the nuclear deal would go into force -- irrespective of the objections from Republicans and a handful of Democrats in Congress, and certainly despite the disapprobation of Israel.  Democratic Senator Schumer of New York, who was part of the four-vote Democratic contingent parting ways with the president conceded that the Obama administration had secured a political victory as he declared: ""Regardless of how one feels about the agreement, fair-minded Americans should acknowledge the president's strong achievements in combating and containing Iran.""International Dimensions:The Iranian nuclear deal certainly had support in Europe where the leaders of the United States' allied countries -- the United Kingdom, France, and Germany -- expressed support for it.  In fact, United Kingdom Prime Minister David Cameron,  French President François Hollande, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel wrote a joint opinion editorial titled ""Why we support the Iran deal,"" which was published in the Washington Post on Sept. 10, 2015.In that piece, the three Western world leaders acknowledged the difficulty of the negotiations process, noting, ""The long history of fruitless nuclear talks with Iran did not give strong grounds for optimism.""  But they also noted that their efforts ended in success, as they declared, ""Nevertheless, two years of tough, detailed negotiation have produced an agreement that closes off all possible routes to an Iranian nuclear weapon in return for phased relief from nuclear-related sanctions.""Cameron, Hollande, and Merkel repeated what United States Secretary of State John Kerry has long argued -- that the agreement was not based on blind trust.  To this end,  they wrote: ""This is not an agreement based on trust or on any assumption about how Iran may look in 10 or 15 years. It is based on detailed, tightly written controls that are verifiable and long-lasting. Iran will have strong incentives not to cheat: The near certainty of getting caught and the consequences that would follow would make this a losing option.""As such, Cameron, Hollande, and Merkel  reached the following conclusion: ""We fully support this agreement because it achieves the goals we had set ourselves. It deals with the uranium enrichment route to a bomb by requiring Iran to reduce by 98 percent its stockpile of enriched uranium; to lower by two-thirds the number of its centrifuges; to limit uranium enrichment levels; and to stop using the deep Fordow site for enrichment. It closes the plutonium route through changes to the Arak reactor so that it does not produce weapons-grade plutonium. And it ensures the IAEA enhanced access not only to Iran's nuclear facilities and the entire nuclear fuel cycle but also, where needed, to any undeclared site.""Political legacies:Meanwhile, regardless of the political machinations  as well as the political posturing, this landmark accord was being celebrated as a historic development in the realm of international diplomacy and global security.  For good of for ill, the re-integration of Iran into the global community would inevitably shift the geopolitical dynamics in the Middle East.  Moreover, both President Rouhani in Iran and President Obama in the United States had made history with this landmark nuclear accord by moving their two countries from a state of decades-old enmity, charting the path of diplomacy, and traversingalong the difficult road of re-engagement.  These efforts would surely define their respective political legacies.  Whether or not this nuclear agreement would stand the test of time and survive hardline domestic politics at home in Iran and the United States was to be determined, but Rouhani and Obama could take heart in the fact that they had respectively honored their election promises to pursue a peaceful resolution to the Iranian nuclear issue.

Special Entry    Saudi Arabia breaks off ties with Iran after executing prominent Shi'a cleric    Ties between Shi'a Iran and Sunni Saudi Arabia  reached a new low at the start of 2016 due to Saudi Arabia's execution of a prominent Shi'a cleric.   Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr was one of 47 individuals executed by Saudi Arabia for terrorism offenses.  Iranian authorities were vociferous in noting that far from being a terrorist, Sheikh Nimr was simply a peaceful martyr expressive in his opposition to Saudi Arabia's ruling regime.   Indeed,  Sheikh Nimr could not be properly understood as a supporter of Iran's hardline leadership since he had actually sought to distance himself from expressly pro-Iranian and anti-American stances.  In many respects, he a political independent of sorts.    To this end, Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei made clear that Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr had been executed precisely for his political views as he declared via the social media outlet, Twitter,   ""This oppressed scholar had neither invited people to armed movement, nor was involved in covert plots."" The Iranian leader added, ""The only act of #SheikhNimr was outspoken criticism.""  For these reasons, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed that retribution in the form of ""divine revenge""  would be upon Saudi Arabia, noting via Twitter that the ""unfairly spilled blood of oppressed martyr #SheikhNimr will affect rapidly & divine revenge will seize Saudi politicians.""    Anger in Iran did not stem only from the highest echelon of power.  Indeed, protesters stormed the  Saudi embassy in Tehran on Jan. 2, 2016, setting the building ablaze before being repelled by security personnel. A day later on Jan. 3, 2015, hundreds of angry protesters had gathered outside the diplomatic compound.  Protests were also erupting outside of Iran.  Of note was a burst of demonstrations in  Saudi Arabia's Eastern Province, which was home to a marginalized population of Shia Muslims, as well as the eruption of protests across the world from Indian-administered Kashmir to Iraq and Bahrain.  In fact, Iraq's top Shi'a cleric,  Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani condemned the execution of Sheikh Nimr, casting it as an act of ""unjust aggression.""   Moreover, in the days following the execution of the cleric,  protests and unrest broke out if Sheikh Nimr's own home district of Qatif in the oil-producing Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia, where angry supporters railed about the injustice of his fate.    While Iranian commentators in the media have condemned the execution of Sheikh Nimr and predicted that it could cause the collapse of the Saudi regime, the actual Saudi regime at home has dismissed any criticism of its actions.  In fact, the Saudi government has insisted that it had the right to enforce the law, which included exacting punishment, while also registering its anger over Iran's  ""blatant interference"" in its internal affairs.    In truth, the move by Saudi Arabia, coupled with Iran's angry reaction was most likely to fuel the existing sectarian hostility between the two countries, as they attempt to gain political ascendancy in the region.  During the course of the previous year, sectarian hostilities between Shi'a Iran and Sunni Saudi Arabia were playing out on proxy terrain in Yemen, with Iran supporting the Shi'ite Zaidi Houthi movement, and with Saudi Arabia supporting the Hadi government forces -- both of which were on a collision course.   The two countries also have not seen eye to eye on the Syrian civil war. The execution of a Shi'a cleric by Saudi Arabia, though, would bring the antagonism between Iran and Saudi Arabia into more direct light, with possible deleterious consequences to come across the region.  Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of the extremist Shi'a Hezbollah movement, referred to this very possibility as he accused the Saudi ruling regime of seeking to ignite a war between Sunni and Shia Muslims across the globe.    Given this dire possibility, there were questions as to why Saudi Arabia would even bother to go forward with the executions and thus accentuate Shi'a-Sunni sectarian antagonism.  The answer was, very likely,  a matter of political expediency on the domestic scene.  While Saudi Arabia was home to a Sunni majority and Shi'a minority population, it is largely reliant on the Sunni Wahhabist population for support.  As a result, taking a harsh stand against the Shi'ite population has been part of a clear strategy to manipulate the sectarian division in Saudi kingdom and shore up conservative Sunni support for the benefit of the House of Saud.    Perhaps with this goal in mind, Saudi Arabia was interested in leveraging sectarian divisions regionally as well.  To this end,  signs of devolving relations came with the decision by Saudi Arabia to cut diplomatic ties with Iran on Jan. 3, 2016.  The decision came in the aftermath of the storming of the Saudi embassy in Tehran.  Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said that all his country's diplomats would be recalled from Iran while Iranian diplomats would be given 48 hours to depart Saudi Arabia. As well, Foreign Minister Jubeir said trade links with Iran would be severed and air traffic links halted, however, Iranian pilgrims seeking to travel to holy sites in Mecca and Medina would be permitted into Saudi Arabia.  Foreign Minister Jubeir said Saudi Arabia  would not allow would  Iran to undermine its right to security, and accused Iran of  ""planting terrorist cells in the region.""  He added, ""Iran's history is full of negative interference and hostility in Arab issues, and it is always accompanied by destruction.""    For its part, Iran reacted by accusing Saudi Arabia of ""continuing the policy of increasing tension and clashes in the region.""  A spokesperson for the Iranian Foreign Ministry, Hossein Jaber Ansari, said: ""Saudi Arabia sees not only its interests but also its existence in pursuing crises and confrontations and attempts to resolve its internal problems by exporting them to the outside.""    It should be noted that Bahrain, Djibouti, and Sudan joined Saudi Arabia in severing ties with Iran, while United Arab Emirates downgraded its ties and diplomatic staff.  Kuwait, Qatar, and Comoros also joined this group of Arab countries as it recalled its ambassador from Iran.    In view of the strident rhetoric adopted by the respective governments of Iran and Saudi Arabia, governments in the Europe and the United States were urging restraint and diplomacy to resolve the broadening imbroglio.  Meanwhile, the United Nations Security Council issued a statement in which it condemned the attack on the Saudi embassy in Tehran. Of note was the fact that no reference in the statement was made to the execution of the cleric.    At the end of the first week of January 2016, the situation grew more tense when Iran accused Saudi Arabia of attacking its embassy in Yemen in an air strike.  Iranian state media claimed that the Saudi air strike deliberately targeted the Iranian embassy in the Yemeni capital of Sanaa.  Other reports indicated that the air strikes had actually hit targets in the region of the embassy and not the diplomatic mission at all.   Nevertheless, the spokesperson for the Iranian Foreign Ministry made the position of the Iranian government clear as he declared: ""Saudi Arabia is responsible for the damage to the embassy building and the injury to some of its staff.""  Accordingly, Iran's government  severed all commercial ties with Saudi Arabia as a result.  For its part, the Saudi-led coalition operating in Yemen said that it had  targeted rebel missile launchers, which may have used abandoned diplomatic compounds.     Concerned that the growing animosity between Iran and Saudi Arabia could deleteriously affect the global effort against the terror enclave,  Islamic State, Iraq -- with its majority Shi'a and minority Sunni population base -- entered the fray and offered to mediate the diplomatic fracas.  To this end,  Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi dispatched  Foreign Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari to Iran  to try to quell the tensions.   As a new conference. Jaafari said,  ""We have solid relations with the Islamic Republic and also we have relations with our Arab brothers and therefore we cannot stay silent in this crisis.""

Special Report on Iran:   - Diplomacy credited for quick return by Iran of U.S. sailors; treatment of sailors in propaganda video raises eyebrows   - Diplomacy credited for release of five U.S. citizens from Iran; seven Iranians in U.S. released as part of prisoner swap   - Iran sanctions lifted thanks to P5+1 landmark nuclear deal; U.S. imposes new sanctions on Iran   Diplomacy credited for quick return by Iran of U.S. sailors; treatment of sailors in propaganda video raises eyebrows   On Jan. 12, 2016, 10 United States sailors were detained by Iranian  Revolutionary Guards after an incursion into Iranian marine territory.  According to reports, one of the two patrol vessels on a   training mission between Bahrain and Kuwait developed mechanical troubles and, as a result, they strayed into Iran's waters.  The crew was then held at an Iranian naval base on Farsi Island. The development spurred some degree of panic in the United States about the fate of the sailors, given the fact that in 2007,  15 sailors from the United Kingdom were detained in a disputed area between Iranian and Iraqi territory and held for weeks.   Soon, however, there were reports that thanks to a recent opening of the diplomatic channels, United States Secretary of State John Kerry was in contact with his Iranian counterpart, Foreign Minister Javad Zarif and that discussions were afoot to arrange the release of the sailors.   Of significance was the fact that Iranian General Ali Fadavi cast the United States' sailors as having committed ""unprofessional"" acts.  He made  clear that the United States vessel had violated Iranian sovereignty by entering Iranian waters; however, he indicated that the sailors would soon be released.  As noted by Fadavi, ""Mr. Zarif [Iran's foreign minister] had a firm stance, saying that they were in our territorial waters and should not have been, and saying that they [the US] should apologize. This has been done and it will not take long, and the naval force, according to its hierarchy, will act immediately upon the orders it receives.""  As promised, the sailors were released in the early hours of Jan. 13, 2016 although the United States made clear that Secretary of State John Kerry did not issue an apology.   For its part, Iran released videotaped footage showing the United States sailors being held at gunpoint by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards.  The video also included footage of one sailor offering an apology for straying into Iranian waters.   While there were strong criticisms of Iran for indulging in what could only be understood as propaganda formation, the general consensus was that such action was to be expected from the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, which was known to be one of the most hardline elements of the Iranian governing structure.   It should be noted that the naval incident occurred at a time when a controversial Iranian nuclear deal was set to be implemented.  At issue was the lifting of punitive sanctions against Iran for its nuclear program.  With that goal in mind, along with an open channel of communication between United States Secretary of State Kerry and Iran's Foreign Minister Zarif, it was perhaps not surprising that the matter was quickly resolved and the sailors were released.  Indeed, according to State Department spokesperson, John Kirby, the foundation of diplomacy set during the nuclear negotiations is precisely why the United States sailors were freed from Iranian custody in less than 24 hours.   Diplomacy credited for release of five U.S. citizens from Iran; seven Iranians in U.S. released as part of prisoner swap   On Jan. 17, 2016, five United States citizens were released from the notorious Evin prison in Iran.  Among the released individuals were Jason Rezaian, a reporter for the Washington Post; Amir Hekmati, a United States marine;  Saeed Abedini, a Christian pastor; Matthew Trevithic, a student, and a fifth individual identified as Nosratollah Khosravi-Roodsari.  Rezaian and Hekmati were imprisoned for charges related to espionage; Abedini was jailed for church activities in people's homes while he was in Iran to set up an orphanage.  The charges related to the arrests of Trevithick and  Khosravi-Roodsari were unknown, although Trevithick was in Iran to attend university and learn the Farsi language.   The freedom for four of the five Americans  was achieved after secret negotiations between the United States and Iran, and was part of a prisoner swap deal that also involved amnesty for seven Iranians jailed in the United States. The release  of the fifth American -- Trevithick --  was not part of the prisoner swap.   On the other side of the equation, the seven Iranians were identified by Iranian media as Nader Modanlo, Bahram Mechanic, Khosrow Afghani, Arash Ghahreman, Tooraj Faridi, Nima Golestaneh and Ali Saboun.  All seven  were detained and either charged or convicted in the United States due to their violations of prevailing sanctions.    As with the rapid resolution to the naval incident discussed above, the opening of the channels of communication and the diplomatic process were credited for the prisoner swap.  That being said, the diplomatic negotations aimed at returning the United States citizens home had been going on for some time and without public discussion of the matter.  If fact, detractors of the Obama administration on the Republican side of the political aisle have long decried the controversial Iranian nuclear deal by drawing attention to the fact that Rezaian, the Washington Post correspondent, remained in jail in Iran.  They argued that the United States should never have signed onto the nuclear deal with the likes of Rezaian in Iranian custody.  Unknown to them, however, was the fact that the Obama administration was steadfastly pursuing the release of the Americans during private negotiations.   Indeed, the determination of the Obama administration was supported by reports from some of the released prisoners up until the moments prior to their departure from Iran.  Of note was the fact that Iranian authorities tried to prevent Rezaian's wife, Yeganeh Salehi,  and his mother, Mary Rezaian,  from boarding the flight intended to evacuate the Americans;  however, representatives from the United States Department of State issued a hardline stance saying that the prisoner swap would be called off if Rezaian's wife and mother were not allowed to join him on the Swiss aircraft.   Ultimately, four of the former prisoners -- Rezaian, Abedini, and Hekmati, Trevithick, as well as Rezaian's wife and mother, boarded the Swiss aircraft and departed Iran and landed in Geneva, Switzerland.  Nosratollah Khosravi-Roodsari, for unknown reasons, opted to remain in Iran.  From Switzerland, three of the four prisoners -- Rezaian, Abedini, and Hekmati --  were transported to  the Landstuhl army base in Germany for medical review.   Trevithick returned home to Massachussetts in the United States and was immediately reunited with his family.   For his part, Rezaian -- the most well known of the prisoners in Iran -- confirmed that he was in good health.  In a report by his employer, the Washington Post, he was reported to have said,  ""I want people to know that physically I'm feeling good. I know people are eager to hear from me but I want to process this for some time.""  In a moment of levity, Rezaian added that  he was doing ""a hell of a lot better than I was 48 hours ago.""  Abedini issued a statement thanking President Obama, his administration, and the State Department for their efforts in securing his release, which read as follows: ""I am thankful for our president and all of the hard work by the White House and State Department in making this happen.""  Hekmati, who was met in Germany by his United States Congressional Representative, Dan Kildee -- a Democrat from Michigan -- used Kildee's Twitter feed to issue the following statement: ""Dear Mr. President: Thank you for making my freedom and reunion wth my family possible. I am humbled that you were personally involved in my case and proud to have you as my president.""   Editor's Note:  Even as amidst the celebration of the release of five Americans from Iranian custody, it is essential to keep in mind that there remains no shortage of people unjustly imprisoned across the world. Of note, is the disturbing number of journalists in prison who have done nothing other than report the news. The Committee to Protect Journalists reports that close to 200 journalists are in jail across the globe.  See this report for more information: https://www.cpj.org /imprisoned/2015.php   Iran sanctions lifted thanks to P+1 landmark nuclear deal; U.S. imposes new sanctions on Iran   On Jan. 17, 2016, following talk in Vienna, Austria, in keeping with a landmark nuclear deal negotiated between Iran and the so-called P5+1 countries, international sanctions on Iran were lifted.   The official lifting of the sanctions was announced in a joint news conference by the European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini and Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif.  Mogherini's statement included the declaration that  Iran had ""fulfilled its commitment. ""   It should be noted that the announcement was made after the international nuclear watchdog entity, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported that Itan had complied with the dictated terms of the nuclear agreement, which were intended to ensure that Iran would not develop a nuclear weapon.    A recapitulation of the central elements  set forth in the nuclear deal, which was formalized in July 2015 via a resolution in the United Nations Security Council, is as follows:   -  Iran would reduce its enriched-uranium stockpile by 98 percent   -  Iran would retain a reduced number of uranium centrifuges (5060 in total) for a ten-year period   -  Iran would be limited to refining uranium  at only a five percent enrichment level for a fifteen-year period   ( this level is consistent for usage at a nuclear power plant and is well short of weaponization levels )   -  Iran will allow IAEA monitors to inspect facilities under review for suspicious activity for up to 25 years   ( Iran does not have to submit to inspections but if it refuses it will be subject to an arbitration panel and possible judgement that it is in violation)   -  Iran would be granted gradual/phased in  sanctions relief, essentially allowing Iran to finally export its oil   -  Iran would be granted access to more than $100 billion in frozen assets pending the implementation of nuclear curbs   -  The prevailing United Nations arms embargo on Iran would  remain in place for five years   -  The prevailing  ballistic missiles embargo on Iran would  remain in place for eight years   _  Iran would be prohibited from  designing warheads or conducting experiments on nuclear weapons-related technology   Via the social media outlet, Twitter, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani praised the development with the following Tweet: ""I thank God for this blessing and bow to the greatness of the patient nation of Iran.""  For his part,  President Barack Obama hailed the move, saying, ""This is a good day because once again we are seeing what's possible through strong American diplomacy. These things are a reminder of what we can achieve when we lead with strength and with wisdom.""  Detractors in Iran and United States respectively had a very different view of the situation.  In Iran, hardliners have long argued that the Iranian government should not be in negotiations with the United States, and sign on to a deal whose terms would be dictated externally.    In the United States, conservatives have argued that the nuclear deal would result in Iran -- a state sponsor of terrorism -- to have access to frozen funds and re-entry to the international markets.   However, the counterpoint argument in both Iran and the United States has been that while the agreement would hardly result in the normalization of relations between the two countries, there was now a diplomatic channel open that was not available for decades prior.  Moreover, as noted by advocates of global security, the deal was the only viable way to reduce the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran.  This sentiment was clear articulated by United States Secretary of State John Kerry, who said, ""Today, as a result of the actions taken since last July, the United States, our friends and allies in the Middle East, in the entire world are safer because the threat of a nuclear weapon has been reduced.""   United Nations sanctions against Iran were automatically ended, but with the formal announcement by Mogherini and  Zarif, along with the certification of Iranian compliance by the IAEA, the European Union ceased its economic and financial sanctions regime against Iran, while the United States lifted its litany of commercial and financial sanctions that had been levied against Iran.    With the sanctions thus lifted, Iran was effectively ""open for business"" with billions dollars of assets now unfrozen, and with   its oil now available to be sold on the international market.  Indeed, Iran immediately acted to increase its oil ouput, while international companies commenced the process of returning to Iran to pursue business deals. However, not all the new was positive for Iran.  By Jan. 18, 2016, the United States had imposed  fresh sanctions on approximately a dozen companies and individuals for their involvement in Iran's ballistic missile program.  At issue was a  the fact that in October 2015, Iran had  conducted a precision-guided ballistic missile test, in violation of a prevailing United Nations prohibition.  As noted by Adam Szubin, the United States acting under-secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, ""Iran's ballistic missile programme poses a significant threat to regional and global security, and it will continue to be subject to international sanctions.""   Editor's Note:  Regardless of the political machinations  as well as the political posturing in both Iran and United States respectively, this landmark accord was being celebrated as a historic development in the realm of international diplomacy and global security.  For good of for ill, the re-integration of Iran into the global community would inevitably shift the geopolitical dynamics in the Middle East.  Moreover, both President Hassan Rouhani in Iran and President Barack Obama in the United States had made history with this landmark nuclear accord by moving their two countries from a state of decades-old enmity, charting the path of diplomacy, and traversing   along the difficult road of re-engagement.  These efforts would surely define their respective political legacies.  Whether or not this nuclear agreement would stand the test of time and survive hardline domestic politics at home in Iran and the United States was to be determined, but Rouhani and Obama could take heart in the fact that they had respectively honored their election promises to pursue a peaceful resolution to the Iranian nuclear issue.

Special Entry:    U.S. President Trump decides to ""decertify""  Iran nuclear deal  On Oct. 13, 2017, President Donald Trump announced that he would ""decertify"" the nuclear deal with Iran.   Trump said,  ""The Iran deal was one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States ever entered into ... but what's done is done.""   It should be noted that the decertification of the  deal is not the same thing as withdrawing from it, which would place the United States in violation of the agreement. Instead, the actual effect would be the establishment of new parameters allowing  Congress to quickly (within 60 days) reimpose sanctions on Iran -- ones that would sideline the Democrats in Congress from the process (essentially preventing them from filibustering it).   That being said, Trump did not actually request that Congress impose sanctions on Iran, which would  unilaterally bring the United States participation in the deal to an end.  Rather, he appears to have handed off that judgement to the Congress. He said, ""I am directing my administration to work closely with Congress and our allies to address the deal's many flaws.""  Should the Congress opt not to act, the Iran nuclear deal would remain in place.    It should also be noted that General James Dunford of Joint Chiefs of Staff, as well as Defense Secretary James Mattis  and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson have all said Iran is in compliance with the terms of the nuclear deal, which was multilaterally forged during the time of the previous Obama administration.  Thus, Trump's ""decertification"" move appeared to be a mostly symbolic attempt to save Trump the annoyance of having to certify a deal forged by his predecessor and nemesis, Barack Obama.   Critics of Trump's move to decertify the deal have noted that allies will likely be mistrustful of the United States in future joint endeavors.   Indeed, it would suggest a lack of good faith by the United states in international affairs, essentially undermining international trust in America's commitment to multilateral agreements.  This perception would likely be bolstered by the fact that the Trump administration had already been disparaging of NATO, while moving to exit participation in the Paris Climate Accord and UNESCO.

",661722,"General Relations Russia has taken important steps to become a full partner in the world's principal political groupings. On Dec. 27, 1991, Russia assumed the seat formerly held by the Soviet Union in the United Nations (UN)  Security Council. Russia also is a member of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the North Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC). It signed the NATO Partnership for Peace initiative on June 22, 1994. On May 27, 1997, NATO and Russia signed the NATO-Russia Founding Act, which provides the basis for an enduring and robust partnership between the Alliance and Russia--one that can make an important contribution to European security architecture in the 21st century. On June 24, 1994, Russia and the European Union (EU) signed a partnership and cooperation agreement.

Russia has played an important role in helping mediate international conflicts and has been particularly actively engaged in trying to promote a peace following the conflict in Kosovo. Russia is a co-sponsor of the Middle East peace process and supports UN and multilateral initiatives in the Persian Gulf, Cambodia, Angola, the former Yugoslavia, and Haiti. Russia is a founding member of the Contact Group and (since the Denver Summit in June 1997) a member of the G-8. In November 1998, Russia joined APEC. Russia has contributed troops to the NATO-led stabilization force in Bosnia and has affirmed its respect for international law and OSCE principles. It has accepted U.N. and/or OSCE involvement in instances of regional conflict in neighboring countries, including the dispatch of observers to Georgia, Moldova, Tajikistan, and Nagorno-Karabakh.  Regional Relations Relations With the CISThe collapse of the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics (U.S.S.R.) or Soviet Union on Dec. 25, 1991, was precipitated by the declarations of independence by several Soviet republics and finally by the formation of the Commonwealth of Independent States, also known as CIS, on Dec. 21, 1991. The CIS was formed by the leaders of 12 of the 15 republics of the U.S.S.R. as a means of preserving political and economic ties between the republics, while allowing each to pursue independent statehood. In addition to Russia, the member states of the CIS are Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan. The three Baltic States (Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia) did not join the CIS for both geopolitical and historical reasons. Although Russia is the most important member of the CIS, the organization is not a continuation of the former U.S.S.R. in a less centralized guise. Rather, the CIS is an organization that fosters a continuation of some of the political and economic relations between its members that occurred during the Soviet era. As of January 2000, the leaders of the CIS had held 23 summit meetings to discuss matters of mutual concern.Russia's relations with the other CIS members, however, have not always been characterized by mutual cooperation and trust. Indeed, the early relations between Russia and many of the CIS member states were strained by the insistence of Russia that Russian troops remain on their territories to protect, sometimes large, Russian minorities. (The emigration of Russians to the republics encouraged during Stalin's rule had resulted in large Russian minorities throughout the Newly-Independent States, or NIS). The Russian military participated, at times covertly, in conflicts on the Afghanistan border of Tajikistan, in Georgia, Moldova, and in the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Russian troops remain engaged in some of these areas still.One important source of tension between Russia and some CIS members concerned the status of former Soviet military assets claimed by Russia. The vital Black Sea Fleet and military installations on the Crimean peninsula severely strained relations between Russia and Ukraine for most of the 1990s. In May 1997, an agreement was finally reached that allowed Russia to lease parts of the naval base at Sevastopol and compensated the Ukraine for ships and other equipment, which previously belonged to the U.S.S.R. Other disputes between Russia and CIS members over military assets have also been settled during the 1990s.In terms of economic relations, Russia has sought some economic integration with, and among, CIS member states. Although the goal of a free trade zone among CIS members has not been met, Russia has reached bilateral agreements with some CIS members that strengthen economic ties. In 1996, Russia signed customs agreements with Belarus and Kazakhstan. In 1997, the President Yeltsin of Russia and President Lukashenka of Belarus signed an agreement to form a confederation between the two states. The subsequent deterioration in relations between the two countries, however, suspended implementation of the agreement. By January 2000, a new agreement had been reached, signed and ratified - creating an, as yet, uncertain confederation between the two states. In 1998, Russia reached an accord with Kazakhstan on the division of Caspian seabed rights. Much of Russia's economic relations with CIS members concern matters relating to the trade in petroleum and natural gas. Both existing and proposed oil and gas pipelines in the Caucasus remain a major foreign policy concern of Russia.Despite the Russian government's efforts, the CIS has not enhanced its reputation. On the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the CIS, President Vladimir Putin welcomed the leaders of 11 former Soviet republics to the Kremlin on Nov. 30, 2001,and urged them to strengthen their ties within the Commonwealth of Independent States. Putin said the recent terrorist attacks in the United States demonstrated the need for forging strong international partnerships.  In 2009, Georgia moved to withdraw from the CIS.  Consequently the body would now be composed of 11 countries in total, including Russia.Relations with UkraineDespite a November 1990 agreement to respect one another's sovereignty and territorial integrity, Ukraine's relations with Russia have been strained due to its concern over Russia's intentions. One important source of tension between Russia and Ukraine concerned the status of former Soviet military assets claimed by Russia. The vital Black Sea Fleet and military installations on the Crimean peninsula severely strained relations between Russia and Ukraine for most of the 1990s. In May 1997, an agreement was finally reached that allowed Russia to lease parts of the naval base at Sevastopol and provided compensation to Ukraine for ships and other equipment, which previously belonged to the U.S.S.R.Relations with Russia improved somewhat with the late May 1998 signing of the bilateral Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation. In September 1998, President Kuchma met with President Yeltsin and discussed the financial crisis and the possibility of a free-trade zone within the Commonwealth of Independent States. However, in December 1998 ratification of the Friendship Treaty was delayed in the Russian Duma due to Ukraine's growing relationship with NATO, the delayed relinquishment of Sevastopol, the home of the Black Sea Fleet, and alleged discrimination against Russian-speaking Ukrainians.Ukraine's development of closer ties to the West, in particular to NATO, the European Union, and the United States, will somehow have to be reconciled with Ukraine's proximity to Russia and reliance on that neighbor. In particular, in March 2000, Ukraine was significantly in debt to Russia for gas shipments. The exact amount owed is under dispute, with Ukraine allowing a $1.4 billion dollar debt, and Russia asserting that the amount due was closer to $3 billion dollars.Geographic proximity and dependence on resources do not provide a complete picture of the ties between Russia and Ukraine. Historical and linguistic ties also bind the two countries together. For more than 350 years, southern and eastern Ukraine was part of the Russian Empire; this region then spent more than 70 years as part of the Soviet Union. For more than 50 years, western Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union. Leftwing Ukrainian politicians have repeatedly raised the possibility of unification with Russia. In the 1999 presidential elections, second-place finisher, Petro Symonenko, was in favor of such a union. In the 1994 presidential elections, it was Leonid Kuchma who campaigned on a platform of greater integration with Russia.Ukrainian-Russian relations were expected to take a turn for the better. On his first three-nation foreign mission since being elected president of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin met in early April 2000 in Kyiv with President Leonid Kuchma of Ukraine in order to raise relations with the neighboring country to a ""qualitatively better level."" The two heads of state also discussed deepening cooperation in arms production and building nuclear reactors, bilateral trade as well as resolving the question of Ukraine's gas payment debt. Both presidents hailed the talks, with Putin calling them a ""good base for developing"" relations, while Kuchma said he was ""deeply satisfied."" During his visit, Putin indicated Russia's willingness to help Ukraine complete two new nuclear reactors that are meant to compensate for the planned closure of the Chernobyl nuclear plant. Kuchma explained to his Russian counterpart that gas companies are to blame for the theft of gas from export pipelines headed through Ukraine to European markets.As noted above, Ukraine claims it owes Russia some $1.4 billion for gas, while Russia insists that the sum is closer to $2.1 billion. A joint commission was expected to look into the matter. However, Putin praised Ukrainian Prime Minister Viktor Yushchenko's offer of a ""constructive"" plan for debt repayment. In the course of the visit, Putin restated Russia's opposition to any further eastward expansion of NATO. Putin said Russia would reconsiders its anti-NATO position if NATO would reconsider its adversarial position about Russia.The appointment of a new Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine resulted in a new series of official statements concerning an improvement in relations with Russia. President Leonid Kuchma, among others, said in October 2000, after reappointing Anatoly Zlenko as minister for foreign affairs, that the Russian component of Ukraine's foreign policy could not be of secondary importance and needed to be enhanced.Presidents Kuchma and Putin signed in February 2001, in the Ukrainian industrial city Dnipropetrovsk, an agreement to coordinate electricity distribution between the two countries. The agreement will allow Russia to sell electricity in Ukraine, where tariffs are higher than in Russia, and vice versa. Commenting on expanding relations with a Ukrainian president who is under fire, Putin said, ""Regardless of the complex political situation, we will work with the president elected legally by the Ukrainian people, Leonid Kuchma.""In May 2001, President Putin appointed veteran Russian statesman and former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin ambassador to Ukraine.Russia and Ukraine continued to maintain stable relations. In September 2001, the Ukrainian military accidentally shot down a Russian commercial airliner carrying Israeli citizens to Russia for a religious retreat. Despite its initial denials, President Leonid Kuchma of Ukraine ultimately admitted the country's mistake and accepted full responsibility for the catastrophe. He said Ukraine would pay reparations to the families of the victims as well as to Russia. Despite this potentially explosive issue, President Putin did not castigate his Ukrainian counterpart, who fired the Minister for Defense Gen. Aleksander Kuzmuk and other military officers.In 2004 and through 2005, Russian-Ukrainian relations were expected to take a negative turn  following the elections in Ukraine.  Indeed, the pro-Western orientation of Ukrainian President Yushchenko led to speculation that he wished to move his country out of Russia's orbit of influence.In 2006, a dispute over the price of gas sold by Russian gas entity Gazprom to Ukraine resulted in the halting of the sale of gas, and the heightening of tensions between the two countries.In early 2009, Russia and Ukraine were again at odds over a gas deal.  At issue was Russia's refusal to implement an agreement with Ukraine to resume the flow of gas to Europe.The central issues in the dispute involved Ukraine's gas debts to Russia and accusations that it (Ukraine) siphoned off gas intended for other European customers.  Meanwhile, there was no agreement about how much Ukraine should pay Russia for gas, or, how much Russia should pay Ukraine for transporting gas to other European destinations. The dispute has left several countries in the region without gas, and with Russian energy company Gazprom unwilling to restart gas supplies,  even as wintry conditions prevailed in the region.  As such, the European Union intervened in an energetic shuttle diplomacy  effort to resolve the matter. On January 12, 2009, it was announced that Russia would resume gas supplies to other European countries via Ukraine.Relations with BelarusLate 2006 and early 2007 saw an imbroglio involving Russia and Belarus.  In late 2006, an agreement was forged in which Belarus was largely compelled to accept Russian gas supplies at double the previous price.  Belarus subsequently retaliated by imposing a new tax on Russian oil shipments that traversed the country, while Russia reacted by refusing to pay the new taxes.The situation became increasingly heated in the second week of January 2007 when the Russian state-owned pipeline firm Transneft closed the Druzhba or ""Friendship"" pipe.  Russia also accused Belarus of siphoning off oil supplies as an illicit means of payment for unpaid taxes and duties.  Representatives of the two countries held talks and the situation was eventually resolved.  The flow of Russian oil resumed, along with assurances being advanced that such stoppages would not occur again.Belarus struck a cooperative tone with Russia, offering at the close of 2007 to allow Russia to host missiles on its soil if the United States moved forward with a controversial plan to build military bases in Poland and the Czech Republic.Relations with MoldovaThere has been tension with Moldova over the presence of Russian troops in the breakaway Trans-Dnestr region. In March 2005, at the time of the Moldovan election, about 100 Russians were barred from entering the country. While the Russians claimed they were election monitors, Moldovan authorities said they were not registered as such and they were likely to disrupt the election. A month prior, several Russians were expelled from Moldova under suspicion of spying, while Russia threatened sanctions against Moldova. At the heart of the Moldovan-Russian imbroglio has been the matter of Russian troops stationed in Trans-Dnestr region where there is a large number of ethnic Russians living. Moldova has called the Russian presence there an illegal occupation.The Trans-Dniestr issue returned to the political landscape in 2006 when an explosion on a bus in the city of Tiraspol  left several people dead and around 20 people injured.  The political landscape of Trans-Dniester had been imbued with discord since March 2006 when  new customs regulations were instituted by Moldova and Ukraine requiring exporters in Trans-Dniester to register with the Moldovan authorities.  Officials in Trans-Dniester administration said that the new rules constituted a blockade of sorts.Relations with EstoniaRussia has had to deal with its post-Soviet relationship with former republics.  In the case of  Estonia, tensions have dominated the relationship. First, nearly 30 percent of Estonia's total population is ethnic Russian. Estonia's citizenship laws - which require knowledge of Estonia - have angered Russia, as it views these laws as discriminatory against ethnic Russians in Estonia. Second, Estonia has been investigating and prosecuting former Soviet officials for alleged crimes against humanity during World War II and the Soviet occupation thereafter. Russia resents what it sees as a fervent pursuit of former Soviet officials in the face of a less than equally fervent pursuit of Estonians who collaborated with the Nazis during World War II. Estonia's tendency to give convicted war criminals suspended sentences (as opposed to actual prison sentences) has somewhat ameliorated the situation.In 2000, relations between Estonia and Russia took center stage as the two countries expelled diplomats from within their own borders over a spying imbroglio.In March 2005, there was something of a diplomatic flap when President Ruutel decided to decline an invitation to attend the celebrations in Moscow scheduled for May to mark the anniversary of the end of World War II. Nevertheless, in May 2005, the two countries signed a treaty delimiting their shared border.The treaty was ratified a month later by parliament, however, an amendment was introduced in the language of the legislation that referenced Soviet occupation.  The Russian government in Moscow said it would not accept such language and withdrew from the agreement in June 2005.In February 2007, the Estonian parliament passes legislation banning the display of monuments valorizing the period of Soviet rule.  The law effectively set in motion a series of actions, that would ultimately result in political unrest.Relations with Czech RepublicA diplomatic imbroglio unfolded in Europe when on August 17, 2008, the Czech Republic  expelled a Russian diplomat and called on a second one not to return to Prague from vacation. At issue were allegations by the Czech government that the Russians were carrying out clandestine intelligence activities.  The allegations were made after Czech intelligence officials came upon information indicating that the two Russian diplomats likely worked for the Russian secret service, and indeed, that one of them was actually a military attache.  The scenario was reported in the Czec media, however, the Czech government would not confirm the situation.  Instead, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, Milan Repka,  said: ""The ministry does not comment on this type of information, whether it has happened or not."" That said, the actual expulsion did not appear to be a matter of debate since Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov condemned the decision.  Lavrov said in an interview with the Russian news agency RIA Novosti, ""This is yet another provocation.""  It was unknown as to whether or not Russia would take the normal reciprocal action of expelling two Czech diplomats from Moscow.Relations with GeorgiaThere are an estimated 3,400 rebels scattered throughout Chechnya and the area around Georgia and the Pankisi Gorge has become a strategic area for the rebels. Tensions between the two countries increased in tandem with Russia's accusation that Georgia has allowed Chechen rebels to move freely and enact terrorist attacks in the area. Russia also claims that after carrying out attacks, the rebels usually flee across the border into Georgia, including the Pankisi Gorge, where they enjoy a safe haven. For its part, Georgia accuses Russia of violating its airspace as it attempts to deal with the rebel threat. Although joint patrols have been established to deal with this transborder issue, at the time of writing, there was no clear resolution. It remains unclear how Putin intends to handle the situation in the long-term, but international observers have expressed increased concern.In September 2006, Russia and Georgia became embroiled in a diplomatic imbroglio.  At issue was the arrest of five Russian officers in Georgia on the basis of allegations of spying.The Russian government in Moscow demanded their release, however, the Georgian government in Tbilisi was itself compelling the handover of a sixth Russian officer.  That officer was apparently within Russian army headquarters, which was surrounded by police in the Georgian capital. The Georgian Interior Ministry claimed that it had evidence showing that the Russian officers had been "" personally carrying out intelligence  activities.""  It also linked Russia with separatist activities in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. In response, Russia ordered the withdrawal of diplomatic officials, including the Russian ambassador,  from Georgia using emergency aircrafts.  Russia additionally urged its citizens to refrain from travel to Georgia and stopped processing visa requests from Georgian nationals.  Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Georgia's actions were a manifestation of an anti-Russian policy and he warned that he would refer the matter to the United Nations.The situation was not helped by Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili's dismissal of Russia's reaction as being ""hysteria.""By the start of October 2006, Russian President Vladimir Putin entered the fray, saying that  Georgia's arrest of  the Russian army officers for spying was tantamount to ""an act of state terrorism with hostage-taking.""  His remarks came following a meeting with the security council of his government and a  day after his government said that it would halt its scheduled withdrawal of troops from Georgia.  The presence of Russian troops in Georgia had been a source of consternation for Georgians and their exit in 2008 had been highly-anticipated.  Georgian Foreign Minister Gela Bezhuashvili responded to that bit of news by saying that his government expected Russia to honor its prior commitment.On October 2, 2006, Georgia said that it was releasing the Russian military officers.  The situation was not automatically resolved, however, as Russia went forward with sanctions against Georgia, including the aforementioned travel restrictions, but also including deportations of Georgians and raids on Georgian-owned businesses.  Georgia protested Russia's actions, with Foreign Minister Bezhuashvili characterizing it as being beyond xenophobia.  By October 9, 2006, Georgia said that it would turn back any aircraft with deported Georgians from Russia.Tensions between the two countries were not helped by a dispute in late 2006 over the price of gas supplies provided to Georgia from Russia's Gazprom.By March 2007, ties between the two counties -- Georgia and Russia -- deteriorated as a result of the poor medical conditions and deaths of several ethnic Georgians who were deported from Russia during the aforementioned diplomatic imbroglio, which started with the detainment of Russian officers on charges of spying in the fall of 2006.  Georgians expressed outrage at the deaths of the deportees, and the Georgian government in the spring of 2007 launched charges of human rights violations against Russia at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.  Russia responded by saying that it believed that it had the right to deport illegal migrants, and as such, it was doubtful that the court would consider the case.In August, 2007, Georgia accused Russia of violating its airspace for a second time within weeks.  The Georgian Foreign Ministry said that a Russian fighter jet had flown a few miles into its territory, according to tracking data from the country's air defense system.  The Russian government in Moscow denied the incursion saying that its planes were not flying close to the border with Georgia on the day in question.  The incident followed a similar episode earlier in the month when Georgia accused Russia of violating its border and dropping a missile close to the Georgian capital of Tbilisi.  Russia vociferously denied that accusation as well.  Two days after the second claim by the Caucasus country that Russia had violated its border, the Georgian Interior Ministry announced that it had fired on what it claimed to be a Russian aircraft after it allegedly violated Georgian airspace.  Russia again denied the claim and noted that there were no reports of missing Russian aircraft. 

These incidences have been indicative of a further devolution of poor relations between the two countries.  In the background, various issues have worked to sour Russian-Georgian relations. Of grave importance has been the Georgian region of Abkhazia, which has been held by Russian-backed separatists.  Georgia views Russia's decision to back the separatists as a virtual annexation.  As well, the two countries have been involved in imbroglios involving spying, the expulsion of ethnic Georgians from Russia as a result, as well as a dispute over the price of Russian gas to Georgia.   Another source of tension comes from Russian accusations that Georgia is hiding Chechen militants in the Pankisi Gorge area, the home of Chechen kin people, the Kists. Since Saakashvili's ascent to power in 2004, relations between the two countries have devolved.  Increased tensions have been blamed not only on the separatist campaigns which have been ongoing for some time, or the presence (until 2008) of two remaining Soviet-era military bases, but also on Saakashvili's Western orientation (away from Russia and toward the European Union and NATO).       

NOTE:In August 2008, Russia and Georgia were embroiled in a violent conflict over South Ossetia.  See ""Special Report"" below for details.Relations with PolandOn September 16, 2010, Chechen separatist leader Akhmed Zakayev was arrested in Poland.  He was in that European country to attend a two-day Chechen summit when he was detained.  Zakayev  was then subject to several hours of interrogation by Polish police, who were acting on the basis of an international arrest  warrant issued by Russia, which sought his extradition on terrorism, murder and kidnapping charges.  For his part, Zakayev has denied being involved in terrorism, and indeed, could be considered something of a moderate since he has called for negotiations with Russia -- a position not embraced by most extremist Chechen separatists.  Since being granted  asylum in the United Kingdom in the first part of the 2000s, Zakayev has been known to travel within Europe.  But in this case, he was arrested by Polish authorities who had no choice but to act on the decision by Interpol to place Zakayev on its most wanted list, at Russia's request.

Attention was soon focused on the question of if Zakayev would actually be extradited to Russia to face charges.   Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said that although the Chechen separatist leader had been arrested, there was no guarantee that Polish courts would rule in favor of extradition to Russia.  Meanwhile, the head of the international affairs committee of the Russian Duma or lower house of parliament, Konstantin Kosachev, applauded Poland for taking its  international obligations seriously.

A day later on September 17, 2010, a Polish court ruled that Zakayev could be released pending its decision on the matter of extradition.  But even if the Polish court eventually ruled in favor of extradition, according to Polish Finance Minister Jan Rostowski, the government of Poland still had the power to intervene on behalf of Zakayev.  Russia responded to events unfolding in Poland in  a less than favorable manner this time. Konstantin Kosachev warned Poland that its failure to act in  accordance with international law would yield deleterious consequences.

Despite successful offensive operations in the North Caucasus, violence by Islamist separatist militants has been ongoing for some time, effectively plaguing areas in the region, such as Chechnya, Ingushetia and Dagestan.     

Other Significant RelationsRelations With the United States

The United States remains committed to maintaining a constructive relationship with Russia in which we seek to expand areas of cooperation and effectively work through differences. The United States continues to support Russia's political and economic transformation and its integration into major international organizations. These steps, in conjunction with achievements in considerably reducing nuclear weapons, have greatly enhanced the security of the United States.   The intensity and frequency of contacts between President Yeltsin and President Clinton, most recently the Moscow Summit in August 1998, are indicative of the strong commitment to working together on a broad range of issues. These include European security, reducing the threat to our countries posed by weapons of mass destruction, and economic cooperation, especially American investment in Russia.      Relations between Putin and the new Bush administration started off to a promising start despite grave differences on issues, such as missile defense. They were strengthened when Russia pledged to join the global war on terror following the terrorist attacks on the United States on 2001.     Relations were increasingly strained in the lead up to  the war in Iraq in 2003 and then in the immediate aftermath.        Relations with the United States took center stage again in  2005 when United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice visited Russia.  During her visit, however, she took time to criticize  President Vladimir Putin's political weight by suggesting that he had too much personal power.  In this regard, Rice expressed concern over the lack of  an independent media in Russia, and she also repudiated the accumulation of political power that Putin had gathered since taking office.      Perhaps most important to the Bush administration in the United States, however, was the matter of foreign investors' rights.  In this regard, the Bush administration would apparently be watching closely the fraud and tax evasion trial of the founder of the Yukos oil company,  Mikhail Khodorkovsky.  Some, perhaps even including those within the Bush administration, have been of the mind that the case against Khodorkovsky was manufactured purely to punish him for his political ambitions.  Naturally, those in the Kremlin have viewed the situation quite differently.  In May 2005, Mikhail Khodorkovsky and an associate were  found guilty of six charges, including tax evasion, and was sentenced to nine years in prison. The verdict was  watched closely by Washington.  Indeed, it  was interpreted symbolically as Russia's approach to foreign investment.       

A year later in May 2006, on the heels of sharp criticism by United States Vice President Dick Cheney of Russia's human rights record, the Kommersant business newspaper said that the matter augured the start of a new Cold War.  Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov offered no comment on the content of Cheney's position, however, he criticized the forum in Lithuania where Cheney spoke.  He noted that such meetings were convened for the purpose of uniting a cadre of interest groups against someone.  Meanwhile, former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev said that Cheney's speech appeared to be ""a provocation and interference in Russia's internal affairs in terms of its content, form and place.""The matter preceded a scheduled meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and United States President George W. Bush at a key industrial summit to be convened in St. Petersburg.  At that meeting in July 2006, during a joint press address by Putin and Bush, the American president called on Russia to democratize, and said that he hoped that the country would enjoy the kind of freedom now being enjoyed by Iraq. Putin responded to this statement by asserting that the example of Iraq -- now embroiled in what some were calling a civil war -- was not one he thought Russia should emulate.

In April 2007, Russia responded negatively to plans by the Bush administration in the United States (U.S.) to develop a missile defense system in eastern Europe. Russian President Vladimir Putin decried the notion, indicating that he viewed such a missile system as being more that simply a defense plan.  To this end, he said, ""This is not just a defense system, this is part of the U.S.  nuclear weapons system.""  President  Putin went so far as to warn the U.S. that its plans in this regard would run the risk of mutual destruction, saying, ""The threat of causing mutual damage and even destruction increases many times."" Making clear its hard-line opposition to the notion of a U.S. missile defense system, President Putin also threatened to withdraw participation in a treaty limiting conventional weaponry in Europe.       NATO responded to Russia's threat to suspend its membership in the 1990  Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) with its own concern.  Indeed, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer made it clear that the treaty was a keystone of security and stability in Europe.     

With the United States planning to construct missile defense facilities in Europe, Russia had already expressed its opposition to such a plan.  But in early June 2007, ahead of the G-8 summit of key world leaders, Russian President Vladimir Putin warned that his country could be forced to point weapons at Europe for the first time since the end of the Cold War.  Russia also announced that it had tested an RS-24 ballistic missile a week prior. 

Both moves appeared oriented toward the maintenance of ""strategic balance"" in the region. To this end, Putin pointed to the fact that the United States had already altered the strategic balance by withdrawing from the anti-ballistic missile treaty in 2002.  In an interview published in the Italian newspaper, Corriere Della Sera, he made the Russian position clear by asserting, ""If the American nuclear potential grows in European territory, we have to give ourselves new targets in Europe.""

The climate of bilateral relations thawed somewhat at the summit when United States President Bush said,  ""They're [Russians] not a military threat.""  He also called for the United States to work with Russia in dealing cooperatively on the issue.

Then, Russian President Putin proposed an alternate solution to the missile defense issue when he suggested that both countries utilize the radar system at Gabala in Azerbaijan to develop a shield that would cover Europe.  In this plan, incoming missiles from hostile countries could be detected.   Putin noted that ""This work should be multi-faceted with the engagement of the states concerned in Europe.""  He also added that if his country and this United States worked together in an open manner to develop missile defense capabilities, ""then we will have no problems.""  

Bush responded to the proposal by saying that it was an interesting option and noted that he and Putin would engage on a ""strategic dialogue"" on the subject in a forthcoming visit of his Russian counterpart to the United States.  Bush' senior advisor on national security, Stephen Hadley's characterization of the Russian proposal as ""a positive development"" augured a possible productive resolution to the matter.  But on October 12, 2007, missile talks between the United States (U.S.) and Russia ended in failure.  U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice had described the bilateral talks with Russia saying, ""We discussed a range of proposals we hope they will accept."" Her Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, said that the proposals required study and in the interim, the U.S. should not work on the missile defense system.  But the U.S. rejected Russia's request to put an end to the plan, with Rice asserting that discussions with Poland and the Czech Republic on the deployment of system would go on as anticipated.  Responding to the U.S. position, Putin  said, ""One day you and I may decide that missile defense systems can be deployed on the Moon, but before we get there the possibility of reaching an agreement may be lost because you will have implemented your own plans.""

Meanwhile, U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates argued that that the missile defense system  was not directed at Russia but at rogue states including Iran and North Korea.  However, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that the very idea of the missile defense shield system was based on the false assumption that Iran presented a nuclear threat.  Lavrov also criticized the U.S. for hinting at the use of force against Iran, saying that  such  an approach contravenes against the notion of a negotiated solution to the Iranian problem.  Russia also reiterated its position that  its own early warning radar systems  in Azerbaijan could easily be used by the U.S.  But Gates responded that radar was incapable of guiding interceptor missiles.

U.S. intransigence on the matter thus paved the way for Russia to make good on its earlier threat to withdraw its participation in the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, which was aimed at limiting conventional weaponry in Europe.  Russia also warned that it could withdraw its participation in the 20-year old Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, which limits both U.S. and Russian short and medium range missiles, and resulted in the elimination of thousands of missiles in both countries. The 2008 election of Barack Obama in the United States was cautiously viewed as an entry point toward improved bilateral relations.  Indeed, in a speech delivered to the Council on Foreign Relations in the United States capital of Washington D.C., Russian President Dmitry Medvedev expressed hopes that his country would enjoy improved relations with the United States under an Obama administrationRussian President Medvedev said that United States President-Elect Barack Obama had the potential to rebuild ""necessary mutual trust"" that had waned during the Bush years.  The Russian president also hinted at possible compromise with the United States over the controversial plan for a United States missile shield in Europe.  He said, ""We have a chance to solve the problem through either agreeing on a global system or, as a minimum, to find a solution on the existing programs, which would suit the Russian Federation.""  As of 2009, the two countries appeared to be working cooperatively on a host of issues including the nuclear programs of Iran and North Korea.  On the issue of Georgia, where bilateral ties have been weaker, the tenor of the discussions appeared cordial.  Notably, when Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov traveled to Washington to meet with both Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, both sides expressed a desire for cooperation. ""We have expressed on several occasions our concerns about Georgia,"" Clinton said. ""But it is, I think, old thinking to say that we have a disagreement in one area, therefore we shouldn't work in something else that is of overwhelming importance.""  Perhaps most importantly, both Lavrov and Clinton made clear that their countries had a shared  interest in maintaining stability in Georgia. Relations with the United Kingdom The mysterious poisoning death of a former Russian spy,  Alexander Litvinenko, in  a London hospital in late 2006 resurfaced in mid-2007.  In July 2007, Russian Prosecutor-General Yuri Chayka ruled against the extradition of a former KGB agent Andrei Lugovoi, whom the British authorities said was responsible for Litvinenko's death. Chayka said that extradition of Lugovoi to the United Kingdom would contradict the Russian constitution.  Meanwhile, Russia said that it would carry out its own investigation and would be willing to prosecute a Russian citizen accused of a crime in another country, using ""evidence provided by the foreign state."" 

For its part, the United Kingdom had earlier noted that Russia had signed the European Union 1957 convention on extradition.  Now with the official Russian decision on the extradition issued, the British authorities responded by expelling four diplomats from the Russian embassy in London.  The British Foreign Secretary David Miliband additionally noted that his country was reviewing its cooperation with Russia on a number of issues. 

Soon thereafter,  Russian Deputy Foreign Minister  Alexander Grushko noted that the expulsion of its diplomats from London could very well hinder bilateral cooperation on counter-terrorism efforts.  As well, Russian announced that it would also expel four staffers from the British embassy in Moscow.  The United Kingdom responded to this action by noting that Russia decision to retaliate in kind was ""not justified.""

Consequently, in 2007,  British-Russian relations were at one of their lowest points in recent history.  Relations with Asia

Russian President Vladimir Putin approved on June 30, 2000, a government document, which outlined the countries foreign-policy priorities. In it, Russia made Asia an important focus of its new foreign policy, which aims to challenge U.S. dominance in world affairs, reported Agence France Presse. Improved ties with China, India and major Far Eastern states featured strongly in the new foreign policy doctrine, which also championed the role of the United Nations and Russia's ties with the European Union. Russia also pledged to defend its national economic interests, the rights of Russians living abroad and to use its secret services ""when the skills of diplomats prove insufficient,"" Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said. Russia had selected Asia as a priority in its efforts to create a genuinely multipolar world ""due to Russia's direct affinity with this dynamically developing region and the need for an economic upturn in Siberia and the Far East."" Moscow would put more emphasis on its membership of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, the Association of South East Asia Nations, or ASEAN, and the Shanghai Five (China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia and Tajikistan).The policy overhaul was long overdue, observers have commented, noting that regional giants India and China were both important markets for Russian military hardware and shared Moscow's concerns over Muslim extremism.On Japan, Ivanov said Russia favored good neighborly ties and ""a stable development of relations,"" but the new document made only passing reference to the long-running Kuril Islands dispute. Soviet troops invaded the string of four islands, known as the Northern Territories in Japan, at the end of World War II. Failure to resolve the issue has prevented Tokyo and Moscow from signing a formal peace treaty.Asia expert Dmitry Trenin, deputy director of the Carnegie Endowment in Moscow, said the policy initiative was long overdue but warned Moscow still had many thorny issues to grasp. ""Russia should exercise enormous efforts simply to remain a country in Asia,"" he said. ""Russia is in danger of losing its Asia dimension. You have depopulation, de-industrialization, total degeneration of vast territories which become adjuncts, at best, to other countries' economies."" In the past Russia had sought to boost ties with Asia when frustrated with links with Washington, teaming up with China and India to provide a counterpoint to the United States, he said.Relations with China and Central AsiaRussia, China and four Central Asian nations signed an agreement in Shanghai, China, on June 15, 2001, on promoting trade and combating Islamic militancy. The agreement is seen as a step toward building a new economic and security bloc in Central Asia, which Beijing and Moscow are also promoting as a way to counter U.S. and European influence in the region. The group also includes the Central Asian republics of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. Uzbekistan was admitted on the first day of the two-day summit here. Russia's relations with China took a cooperative turn in 2006 when Russian President Vladimir Putin was visited Chinese President Hu Jintao in Beijing for two days. The two leaders signed nearly 30 agreements, and crafted the terms of a political, economic and technological alliance that some may regard as a historic shift in the geopolitical alignment of the globe.Security Cooperation  NATO/Russia Founding Act. Russia signed the NATO Partnership for Peace initiative in June 1994. U.S. and Russian troops are serving together in the Implementation Force in Bosnia and its successor, the Stabilization Force. Building on these steps, NATO and Russia signed the NATO-Russia Founding Act on May 27, 1997, in Paris. The act defines the terms of a fundamentally new and sustained relationship in which NATO and Russia will consult and coordinate regularly, and where appropriate, act jointly. Cooperation between NATO and Russia exists in scientific and technical fields.Although Russia joined NATO's Partnership for Peace initiative (as noted in the previous paragraph), which provided for closer cooperation with NATO countries without granting full membership, Russia opposed the inclusion of former Warsaw Pact members in NATO. Russian opposition to NATO expansion was somewhat placated in 1997 when NATO agreed not to deploy nuclear weapons in the eastern countries and with the signing of the Founding Act on Mutual Relations, Cooperation, and Security. The agreement granted Russia greater say in NATO policy, but did not grant Russia the veto power given to full members.NATO allies agreed on Dec. 6, 2001, to set up a new forum for closer cooperation with Russia, but Washington's doubts about granting Moscow a right of veto stopped what one diplomat branded ""starry-eyed"" ambitions. Diplomats said there was an abrupt cooling in Washington's position on improving ties with the 19-strong alliance's Cold War foe. Diplomats said Washington and others, including the three former Warsaw Pact nations that joined NATO in 1999, were anxious not to rush headlong into a relationship or council that would lock them into consulting Moscow on certain security issues.In the end, the ministers agreed to aim for a NATO-Russia council which could identify opportunities for consultation, cooperation, joint decisions and joint action ""at 20"" by their next meeting in Iceland in May 2002. In addition to the struggle against terrorism, Russia and NATO suggested in a joint statement that they could work together in such areas as crisis management, nonproliferation, arms control, theater missile defense, search and rescue at sea, military-to-military cooperation and civil emergencies.A 2000 Russian policy paper emphasized Russia's destiny as a great power and insisted that any United Nations reform must keep Moscow's United Nations Security Council veto intact.  Middle East Peace ProcessMoscow convened talks with newly-elected Hamas in March 2006. During those key talks, Khaled Meshaal, the leader of the Palestinian militant group,  told Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov that he wanted to forge  ties with Russia. Meanwhile, the Russian foreign minister said that Russia respected the democratic choice of the Palestinian people when they elected Hamas to power.  On behalf of Russia, Lavrov nevertheless said that Hamas must transform itself from a militant entity to a political organization if it wanted to have a serious political future.  Lavrov  also expressed Russia's commitment to  achieving a lasting peace in the Middle East, however, he called on Hamas to recognize the Jewish State of Israel.For his part, Meshaal referred to the talks with Moscow as constructive but insisted that peace would only be possible if Israel withdrew from territory occupied in 1967.The decision by Russia to meet with Hamas constituted a gap in otherwise coordinated efforts by the Quartet -- the United States, the United Nations, the European Union and Russia -- to achieve peace in the Middle East. Until the Russian meeting, the members of Quartet had refused to deal with Hamas, on the basis of the militant group's dubious legacy of carrying out numerous terrorist attacks in Israel. For its part, Israel expressed outrage about the meeting.Despite the controversial nature of the meeting, Moscow has made the calculation to actively insert itself into the Middle East peace process.  For Moscow, the talks represent a re-entry point into the global spectrum, albeit amidst a host of potential diplomatic risks.The issue of Iran's nuclear ambitions has also been of key importance as regards Middle Eastern security as of 2006.  The West has been opposed to Iran's uranium enrichment activity and the United States particularly has accused Iran of seeking to build nuclear weaponry, and not simply generating nuclear power.  Iran's failure to fully cooperate with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has not helped to alleviate these suspicions.  In a bid to diffuse the ever-more volatile situation, Russia offered a compromise plan to Iran whereby it would be responsible for uranium enrichment off Iranian territory and in keeping with international standards.  But it was a plan that was not accepted by Iran.Nevertheless, regardless of Iran's obstinacy, and despite the United States' insistence on economic sanctions against Iran for failing to abide by IAEA dictates, Russia has continued to advocate a diplomatic approach to the dispute and has remained a central player in the matter.Nuclear PoliticsIn early 2005, the nuclear issue took center stage as Iran and Russia signed an agreement by which Moscow would supply fuel for Iran's new nuclear reactor in Bushehr. Under the terms of the agreement, Iran must return spent nuclear fuel rods from the reactor, which had been designed and built by Russia. This condition was implemented in response to growing anxiety by the United States, Israel and others about Iran's nuclear ambitions.

Against the backdrop of this development was a meeting in Slovakia between Russian President Vladimir Putin and United States President George W. Bush in which both leaders agreed that Iran should not develop nuclear weapons. Russia, however, refused to acquiesce to United States's pressure to completely halt cooperation with Iran on nuclear power.   Two years later, there was little progress on the issue, with the United States growing more impatient with Iran's refusal to end its nuclear ambitions, and with Russia disinclined to take as strong a stand with Iran as the United States would have liked.   In 2007, Russian President Vladimir Putin was set to travel to Iran to attend a summit of the leaders of Caspian Sea countries despite of reports of a possible assassination plot against him there.  Russian media reported that suicide bombers were planning to kill the Russian head of state during his visit to the Iranian capital of Tehran. Some Russian sources acknowledged that the threats likely contained some degree of reliability.  However, the Iranian Foreign Ministry said that there was no basis in fact to the reports.  Nevertheless, during a news conference in Germany, Putin dismissed rumors that he might cancel his visit amidst the threats saying, ""Of course I'm going."" That said, the Russian leader's arrival in Iran for was delayed by one day to October 16, 2007.   Putin  also confirmed that the issue of Iran's controversial nuclear program would be on the agenda for discussion.  To that end, he urged a peaceful resolution to the matter and called for patience on the part pf the international community in resolving the dispute.  He noted that threatening Iran would be futile since Iran and its people were not scared.

Putin would be the first Russian leader to visit Iran since Stalin visited that country during the Soviet era in 1943.  In December 2007, the latest National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) in the United States concluded that Iran halted its weapons program in 2003. The NIE, which coalesces information  from the United States' 16 intelligence agencies, asserted ""high confidence"" that Iran stopped its nuclear weapons program in 2003 ""in response to international pressure.""  Accordingly, the NIE reflected similar findings by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).  Mohammed ElBaradei, the head of the nuclear watchdog agency, said, ""The report gives me a sigh of relief because it is consistent with our assessment.""  

Nevertheless, the United States and other Western countries continued to characterize Iran's nuclear development as threatening.  With Iran currently subject to both United Nations (U.N.) Security Council sanctions, as well as unilateral United States sanctions, there was speculation about how, or if, the sanctions regime would be affected by the new information.  In fact, the most immediate outcome of the NIE has been the collapse of the argument in favor of military action against Iran.While dissonance on the international stage was expected to continue to smolder over the fact that Iran has continued to abrogate U.N. Security Council edicts that it stop its enrichment of uranium, the temperature of the conflict was expected to decrease. As well, U.N. Security Council members, Russia and China, were now less likely to support the notion of strongly intensifying sanctions against Iran.  Both countries were expected to argue that the NIE proved that the nuclear threat posed by Iran was now contained.But the nuclear issue of Iran was not to see any resolution.  In May 2008, the United Nations nuclear watchdog group, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) , said that Iran was withholding some information about its nuclear program.  The IAEA said in a report that Iran was not providing enough information about its nuclear activities despite agreeing to clarity prevailing questions about the country's  nuclear development program.At issue for the IAEA was the fact that Iran has been operating 3,500 centrifuges  in  Natanz.June 2008 saw  international negotiators put forth a new package, laden with attractive incentives, to Iran aimed at halting that country's nuclear enrichment activities.  The deal was reached after extensive consultations between European Union policy chief, Javier Solana, and  Iranian representatives.  The talks were  aimed at resolving many of the contentious issues that had, to date, left the nuclear issue in Iran unresolved.  Javier Solana described the new incentive package for Iran as  ""full of opportunities.""  Solana said the five members of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (the United States, the United Kingdom,  China, Russia, France) as well as Germany were willing to both recognize Iran's right to have a civilian nuclear energy program, and to assist in its development for peaceful purposes.  For its part, Iran  warned it would  not accept demands that it  halt its nuclear enrichment activities but it would study the proposal.Meanwhile, rumors began to speculate about a strike against Iran's nuclear facilities.  On July 9, 2008, Iran test-fired nine missiles in an apparent warning to Israel and the United States that it was capable of retaliating against any potential military strike on Iran.  The missiles included both short-range and long-range types, as well as the new version of the Shahab-3, which was purported to be have sufficient range as to reach Israel.The missile test came less than a month after Israel carried out a military exercise presumed to be a rehearsal for an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities. The whole question of Israel's possible  military strike option was predicated on two considerations.  First, it may be prepared to take action if it is clear that Iran has enough enriched uranium with which to make a nuclear bomb (a stage that the National Intelligence Estimate in the United States had said was not yet been reached by Iran).  Second, Israel may be prepared to take action if Iran acquires a new Russian anti-aircraft system, the S-300 (a process that could take an extended period of time).In early August 2008, only a day after the United States and the United Kingdom warned that Iran would face a heightened sanctions regime if it did not respond positively to prevailing proposals on how to deal with its controversial nuclear program, the government of Iran offered an ambiguous response to the European Union (EU).  Late September 2008 saw the United Nations  Security Council  unanimously approve a new resolution on Iran.  United Nations  Security Council  resolution 1835  reified previous demands that Iran halt its uranium enrichment activities but did not expressly impose new sanctions.There were no new sanctions in the resolution due to Russia's objections to such a move.The resolution came a week after the IAEA said that it was unable to provide assurances about Iran's controversial nuclear development program due to a lack of information.On February 20, 2009, a new report by the United Nations' nuclear watchdog entity, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), asserted that Iran was understating how much uranium it had enriched, and that it had built up a stockpile of nuclear fuel.  According to reports by Reuters, the discrepancy in the amount of uranium believed to have been enriched and the amount enriched in actuality was not due to subterfuge by Iran, but rather, a result of a technical mistake. Then on March 1, 2009, the United States senior military commander, Admiral Mike Mullen, said that Iran had enough nuclear material to manufacture a bomb.While there continued to be rumblings about a military strike against Iran's nuclear facilities, so too were there calls for negotiations with the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and Germany. Russia and China -- two countries who have urged restraint by the West in dealing with Iran, have urged the Iranian authorities to accept the invitation. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Iran had to ""convince us all of the exclusively peaceful character of its nuclear program.""  Such talks were not immediately on the agenda since the controversy over Iran's contested elections of 2009 took center stage.See below for later developments related to Russia's engagement on the Iranian nuclear issue.Meanwhile, from around 2002 through the next several years, Russia worked with several other countries within a multilateral framework to deal with the threat of nuclear proliferation by North Korea.  Those talks stalled soon thereafter.In mid-2006, North Korea test-fired a number of short-range missiles and one Taepodong-2 long-range missile into the Sea of Japan. The situation sparked international condemnation and threats of punitive measures by some countries, including sanctions.  Others, including Russia, called for a return to multilateral talks on North Korea.For its part, North Korea said  that further missile tests would be launched.  North Korea also warned that it would react strongly to punitive pressures from the international community, and it threatened to carry out an ""annihilating"" nuclear strike if its atomic facilities were pre-emptively hit by the United States.The missile tests, in conjunction with dire promises of further tests and a nuclear strike, have intensified the widely-held view that North Korea is a threat to global security. Moreover, these moves by North Korea effectively served to further isolate the country and confirm its pariah status within the international community. The impact on relations with Russia was yet to be determined.The matter resulted in the passage of a resolution by the United Nations Security Council members, including Russia, mandating inspections on cargo going to and from North Korea to search for weapons, a ban on the sale or transfer of materials related to North Korea's unconventional weapons program, and a freeze on the transfer of funds connected with North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.  Absent from Resolution 1718 was the Chapter Seven [of the United Nations charter] provision, which would enforce the sanctions via military force.December 2006 marked the resumption of multilateral talks regarding North Korea's controversial nuclear program.  North Korea, South Korea, China, Japan, Russia and the United States indicated their interest in returning to the negotiating table after a year-long hiatus.  While the news of the recommencement of  six-party talks was welcomed, there was also a pervasive sense of caution. Experts conveyed limited optimism about the prospects of forging a resolution amenable to all parties.By February 2007, the multilateral discussions were ongoing.  Progress was quickly made during the six-party talks in Beijing when North Korea agreed to move closer toward the position of disarmament.  Of particular interest was an agreement  reportedly requiring Pyongyang to shut down its nuclear facilities  at Yongbyon over the course of the ensuing months, in lieu of aid, such as fuel oil provided by the United States and South Korea.  The draft agreement, which had been drafted by China,  also called for the return of international inspectors to North Korea. On February 13, 2007, it was announced that concurrence on the matter had been reached.  Yet to be seen was whether or not the agreement would be ratified by all six parties, and also whether or not North Korea would fully comply with the provisions of the deal.In June 2007, North Korea reportedly agreed to shut down its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon and, then, disable its nuclear facilities.  North Korea also noted that it was inviting International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors to return to North Korea to monitor the closure of its nuclear program and facilities.  To that end, IAEA inspectors were expected to visit North Korea on June 26, 2007, for the first time since their dismissal from that country in 2002.These announcements came months after the Chinese drafted an agreement in February 2007 (discussed above), in which the closure of the reactor at Yongbyon would be secured, in lieu of heavy fuel oil that would be secured by other countries participating in the multilateral nuclear disarmament talks.The total amount of fuel oil -- one million metric tons -- appeared to more substantial that the original quantity discussed earlier in the year under the Chinese-brokered plan.  In addition, diplomatic recognition and humanitarian aid benefits were included in the deal.  Also included in the arrangement was the untangling of a financial dispute.A new round of six-party disarmament talks, which has included North Korea, South Korea, China, Japan, Russia and the United States, was  commenced in July 2007.  Later in 2007, concurrence was reached with North Korea in which that country officially agreed to shut down its nuclear facilities and open the country up to atomic inspection.A year later  in June 2008 North Korea declared its nuclear assets.  In October 2008, the United States removed North Korea from its list of terrorism sponsors as part of the denuclearization agreement.At the end of that year, it was clear that North Korea;s disarmament progress had stalled.  Then at the start of 2009, the United States reacted by suspending energy aid to North Korea. Soon thereafter, relations devolved between the two Koreas when the South Korean leader said that aid to the North would be dependent on that country's willingness to completely end its nuclear weapons program. North Korea accused South Korea of hostile intent and announced it was ending all political and military agreements with its neighbor to the south.April 2009 saw North Korea take provocative action by launching a communications satellite into space via rocket.  That claim was widely viewed as obfuscation of a missile test.  On May 25, 2009, less than three years after the earlier underground nuclear test, North Korea conducted a second such test, arguing the merits of its right to a military deterrent. Days later, North Korea announced its withdrawal from the armistice that ended the Korean War.Meanwhile, multilateral negotiations including North Korea, South Korea, China, Japan, Russia, and the United States have remained stalled.In the second week of June 2009, Russian officials warned that North Korea was close to test-firing  another ballistic missile.  Around the same time, the United Nations Security Council  imposed harsh new sanctions against North Korea in response to the nuclear test carried out in May 2009.  For its part, North Korea reacted to these developments by threatening to weaponize its stocks of plutonium.Special ReportFrance negotiates truce agreement for Georgia and Russia as fighting dies down in separatist enclaves of South Ossetia and Abkhazia

On August 8, 2008, the Georgian military launched an attack against separatist targets in South Ossetia.   The military offensive ensued only hours after the Georgian authorities and South Ossetia's separatists agreed to a Russian-brokered ceasefire.

The situation began when Georgian military troops and Russian-backed South Ossetian separatists were ensconced in violent clashes over the course of several days.  Georgian tanks then attacked the separatist stronghold of  Tskhinvali, presumably in an effort to regain control of the region.

According to Russian media, several people were reported to have been killed in the shelling.  As well, Georgian forces and South Ossetian separatists were reported to be exchanging heavy fire.  To that end, explosions and rocket fire were heard in the area around Tskhinvali.  The British newspaper, The Independent, reported that ""the assault is coming from all directions.""

For its part, Georgia said that it was taking this action to stabilize the territory [South Ossetia].  Georgian Minister for Integration, Temur Yakobashvili, said that his country was compelled to terminate South Ossetia's  ""criminal regime"" and to ""restore constitutional order"" to the breakaway region.   Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili himself called for an end to bloodshed to end, but warned the South Ossetian separatists that Tbilisi's patience was not limitless.

On the other side of the equation, South Ossetian rebel leader Eduard Kokoity said that Georgia was carrying out  ""a perfidious and base"" attack on Tskhinvali.  He also confirmed the assault on Tskhinvali saying,  ""The storming of Tskhinvali has started.""  Eyewitnesses on the ground said that the city was being attacked, the hospital was destroyed and the university was on fire. The Red Cross reported that there were numerous casualties needing medical attention.

In response, Russia was  said to be deploying troops to South Osseta to assist peacekeepers operating there.   Indeed, an aide to the Russian Land Forces commander confirmed that Russian tanks and troops had entered South Ossetia and were approaching  Tskhinvali, which was reported to have been already devastated by the Georgain offensive there.

Russia's military presence in the region was not well-received by Georgia, given the fact that the Georgian government has long accused Russia of arming South Ossetian separatists.  But Russia has its own counter-argument to levy against Georgia.  It has accused Georgia of deliberately ramping up its own military presence in breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia and assuming a hard-line posture against these enclaves.  Russia's tensions with Georgia have been partially  rooted in another concern.  Specifically, Russia has been opposed to  pro-Western Georgia's ambitions to join NATO.  This geopolitical element has textured the larger context of the territorial struggle being played out in South Ossetia.

It should be noted that  Russia has enjoyed strong ties with South Ossetia, largely due to the fact that the ethnically-related province of North Ossetia is located within its borders, and both the south and the north have long hoped to unite. Indeed, many South Ossetians hold Russian citizenship.  As such, with vested interests on both sides of the border, Russia called for an end to the ongoing violence.  Russia also urged theinternational community to  work cooperatively ""to avert massive bloodshed and new victims.""

However, the prospects for peace were not likely to be easily advanced, given the emerging situation in the region a day later.On August 9, 2008,  Georgian authorities said that Russian jets had bombed military targets inside its territory – specifically in  the Georgian town on Gori to the south of South Ossetia.  They also said that one attack ensued close to the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, which is known to supply Caspian oil to the West.  Georgia described the air strikes as  ""a full-scale military invasion""  and Georgian President Saakashvili claimed that Russia was at war with his country.

Russia had a very different perspective and placed the blame squarely on the Georgians.  Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov indicated the dire nature of the situation by asserting that already  1,500 people had died in the conflict and more than 30,000 South Ossetian had fled into Russia to escape the threat of death.  The Russian government said that it had to act to protect the South Ossetians, many of whom hold Russian citizenship. Russian President Dmitri Medvedev said that Georgia also bore a responsibility for ""protecting the [South Ossetian]  population"" and that his country's military action was intended  ""to force the Georgian side to peace.""

By August 9, 2008, the  Russian army had advanced to take complete control South Ossetia's capital of Tskhinvali.  General Vladimir Boldyrev, the head of the Russian ground forces said, ""Tactical groups have completely liberated Tskhinvali from the Georgian military."" Boldyrev also said that Russian forces would keep up the pressure on Georgian military units. Russian  President Dmitry Medvedev explained his country's objectives in South Ossetia saying,  ""Under these circumstances, Russia is guided by one task -- to immediately stop violence and defend civilians and restore peace as soon as possible.""  President Dmitry Medvedev also  demanded  the withdrawal of Georgian troops from the conflict zone, saying that it was the only way to settle the ""tragic crisis.""

That same day, Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili called for an end to hostilities saying,  ""We propose an immediate ceasefire and the beginning of the withdrawal of troops from the contact line.""  On the home front, the Georgia's parliament approved a presidential decree that essentially imposed  two weeks of martial law  in the country.

A day later on August 10, 2008, Georgia said that it was withdrawing its troops from the South Ossetian capital of Tskhinvali in the face of  Russia's counter-offensive.  Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili said his country's troops were returning to the positions they held before the conflict erupted days earlier.  There was, however, some confusion about whether Georgian troops were pulling out of Tskhinvali or withdrawing entirely from South Ossetia. Georgian Reintegration Minister Temur Yakobashvili confirmed that the troops left Tskhinvali but were remaining in other areas of South Ossetia. Russian sources said that Georgian military units were still active in South Ossetia.

Presumably due to the continued activity by Georgian military units in South Ossetia, and what Moscow described as  continued Georgian offensive action, Russian forces were continuing to carry out its own military action into Georgian territory.  Reports from the region suggested that Russia carried out an air strike on a military airfield near the Tbilisi International Airport.

With the situation grim despite the earlier declaration of a withdrawal of troops from Tskhinvali, Georgia said that it had submitted a note to the Russian embassy in Tblisi calling for immediate negotiations with Russia regarding ""an end to all hostilities and a ceasefire.""  Russia confirmed that the note had been received.  Russia at the time also denied Georgia's claims that Russian air strikes had targeted populated areas.

But movement toward a resolution seemed no closer by August 11, 2008.  Georgian authorities said that Russian air strikes hit  communications facilities to the west of Tbilisi and the port city of Poti in the Black Sea. As well, Russian forces were reported to have led a raid through the other breakaway enclave of Abkhazia into the western Georgian town of Senaki.  On the other side of the equation, Russia said that the Georgian military was still targeting positions in Tskhinvali, despite claims of a withdrawal and overtures of a ceasefire.In this way, both sides accused one another of continuing the hostilities and exacerbating the conflict.

On the international front, the United Nations Security Council had earlier convened an emergency session to consider the rapidly deteriorating security crisis in the Caucasus.  Little was actually accomplished at that session.  Likewise, a spokesperson from NATO had already called on both sides -- Georgian and Russian -- to exercise restraint.  However, with the violence ongoing, clearly restraint was not at hand.

Nevertheless,  the United States said that it was sending a delegation to the region to try to negotiate a resolution.  The United States Department of States said that the envoys would  ""engage with the parties in the conflict.""As well, a European Union delegation was en route to the region and said that it was hoping to procure a ceasefire and withdrawal agreement from both Georgia and Russia.A separate Council of Europe delegation was also hoping to advance dialogue.

In the same time period, according to news reports, Russian President Medvedev reiterated the death toll -- in the thousands -- during a conversation with United States President George W. Bush. For his part, Bush, who was attending the Beijing Olympics, called for an end to the violence, warned of  escalation beyond the zone of conflict, and endorsed the notion of international mediation.

Indeed, the international community's objective appeared to be focused on averting the prospects of a war in the restive Caucasus, which has long been regarded as something of a powder keg.  Yet to be determined was the question of whether or not such efforts would actually yield positive results.

Days later, Russia  noted that its military activity in the area was ending and Russian troops were seen retreating from the area.  The hostilities flared again when Georgia sent in troops to try to regain control of South Ossetia.  Nevertheless, witnesses said that the full brunt of the fighting in South Ossetia appeared to be ending. Elsewhere in the region, Russian troops were withdrawing from the other breakaway region of Abkhazia, however, separatist there were reported to be ensconced in some continuing clashes with the Georgian military in the Kodori Gorge.

Yet even with an official truce in the offing (as discussed below) and an end to the fighting, the situation was not peaceful.  A war of words continued.  On an official day of mourning in his country, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev charged that Georgia had launched ""genocide of the South Ossetian people.""  At issue were the deaths of thousands of South Ossetians, many of whom hold Russian passports, as well as the deaths and injuries to scores of Russian soldiers, including one general.  The Russian leader used the Russian word ""otmorozki,"" which roughly translates to ""thugs"" in English, to characterize Georgian troops.  Meanwhile, Georgian President Saakashvili  addressed a crowd ofthousands  gathered in Tbilisi's main and accused Russia of  the ""ruthless, heartless destruction"" of  Georgians.  The Georgian leader also warned that his country would no longer be a part of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) -- a group consisting of former Soviet republics.

On August 13, 2008,  French President Nicolas Sarkozy was leading diplomatic negotiations  to help Georgia and Russia resolve the crisis that had been sparked when Georgian military troops and Russian-backed South Ossetian separatists were ensconced in violent clashes over the course of several days.  Georgian tanks then attacked the separatist stronghold of  Tskhinvali, presumably in an effort to regain control of the region, and went onto gain military supremacy over large swaths of Georgian territory.

Sarkozy put forth a peace agreement that both sides signed days later.  Central to the proposed plan for a truce was that all forces would pull back to pre-conflict positions. Other elements of the plan included an end to the use of force, an end to military action in perpetuity, as well as the free access of humanitarian aid.France, as the head of the European Union, has called on the European bloc to endorse the peace initiative ahead of its submission to the United Nations Security Council.  The European Union was also expected consider deploying peacekeepers to the region to maintain peace and security, and also to protect the supply of humanitarian aid.

The remaining thorny issue, which was not included in the framework of the truce, was the future status of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Neither Russian President Medvedev nor Georgian President Saakashvili  was likely to find common ground on that matter in the immediate future.  Indeed, the Georgian leader asserted, ""The territorial integrity and belonging of South Ossetia and Abkhazia to Georgia can never be put under doubt.""

On August 17, 2008, Russia officially pledged to withdraw its forces from Georgian territory in keeping with the agreement.  At the time, however, its forces had control over large swaths of Georgian territory, including the main east-west highway through that country.  There was speculation that Russian troops might withdraw only as far as South Ossetia since Russia said it would only fully withdraw when Georgian police were ready to take over responsibility for security.  NATO responded to anxieties that Russia would not abide by the withdrawal requirements of the agreement by warning that relations would be compromised if Russian troops remained in Georgia.  Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Russia was not occupying Georgia and would not annex South Ossetia. However, he also characterized NATO as biased and intent on saving the ""criminal regime"" of  Tbilisi.

Meanwhile, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev told his French President Nicolas Sarkozy that the Russian withdrawal  would be complete by August 22, 2008, although approximately 500 troops would be  installed as peacekeepers on both sides of South Ossetia's border.  Russian troops were soon identified exiting Gori -- the largest town in Georgia located close to the border of South Ossetia.  Sarkozy, during talks with  Medvedev, acknowledged this withdrawal but noted that Russian troops were yet to exit Poti and Senaki.  Russia had earlier indicated that it would not soon leave the port city of Poti, and claimed that this would be in keeping with the terms of the ceasefire agreement.  Medvedev's government said that Russian peacekeepers were allowed to take ""additional security measures.""  However, the United States and the United Kingdom countered this claim noting that such buffer zones would violate the deal.

In other developments, the first United States ship with humanitarian aid was expected to dock in Georgia by the last week of August 2008.  Two more ships were expected to arrive in Georgia as well.In the last week of August 2008, Russia's Kremlin officially recognized the breakaway enclaves of South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent states.  South Ossetians and Abkhazians celebrated the news of this recognition of their self-proclaimed sovereignty.  However, withoutwider  international recognition of sovereign status, and with many countries of the West committed to the notion of Georgia's territorial integrity, the actual status of South ossetia and Abkhazia remained in the zone of ""contested independent status.""By the start of September 2008, the European Union  (EU) had decided to suspend talks on a new partnership pact with Russia, given  the still-incomplete withdrawal of Russian troops from Georgia.  EU-Russian negotiations on the partnership agreement had been scheduled for mid-September 2008 but were based on a shared understanding that Russian troops would withdraw to pre-conflict positions.  The lack of progress on that withdrawal front, followed by the EU's response,  signaled that relations between the EU and Russia were moving into highly challenging territory.

Following a meeting in the Belgian capital city of Brussels, EU Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said that the bloc that he represented could not ""continue as if nothing had happened.""  As well, the European bloc's foreign policy chief, Javier Solana, said that the EU could deploy civilian monitors to Georgia to determine whether of not Russia was complying with the ceasefire agreement that had been brokered earlier.  Meanwhile French President Sarkozy said,""The EU would welcome a real partnership with Russia, which is in the interests of all, but you have to be two to have a partnership.""

On the other side of the equation,  Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned that unchecked support by the EU and the United States for the government of Georgian President Saakashvili would be a ""historic"" mistake.  He also introduced the notion of an embargo on arms supplies to Georgia until a new regime was established there.  These declarations came in the background of Russian President Dmitry Medvedev's assertion that his country's foreign policy principles would not be dictated by the hegemony of any single country, such as the United States. In October 2008, months after the Russian-Georgian conflict over South Ossetia, Russia  removed a checkpoint near the town of Gori.  The removal of the checkpoint  at Gori  -- located in Georgian territory close to the separatist region of South Ossetia -- marked the first significant sign that Russia intended to comply with its withdrawal pledge, which was part of the ceasefire deal negotiated by French President Nicolas Sarkozy . Indeed, Russia has also pledged to withdraw troops from  two buffer zones within Georgia -- now under European Union observation --  by October 10, 2008.

At the same time, Russia  increased its troop presence in South Ossetia -- largely a result of an explosion that left eight Russian soldiers and three civilians dead in the early part of the month.  Russia accused Georgia of orchestrating the attack; Georgia denied the accusation. Russia also maintained its troop presence in the other separatist region of Abkhazia.  Russia has recognized both South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent while Western countries have backed Georgian territorial integrity.  The matter of sovereignty has remained unresolved.The  fifth anniversary of the Rose Revolution, which swept President Mikhail Saakashvili to power, was marked by chaos.  As the president traveled in a motorcade with Polish President Lech Kaczynski  close to the breakaway republic of South Ossetia, shots were fired.

Although no one was hurt in the incident, both the  Georgian president and his Polish counterpart  accused Russian troops of being behind the apparent attack in an area that has been the site of much cross-border violence.  According to Reuters, one individual in Saakashvili's entourage said that South Ossetians  fired warning shots when their motorcade came close to a checkpoint at the quasi-border area.  Meanwhile, President Saakashvili said that the situation was a ""reminder"" that Russia was in  flagrant violation of the European Union-brokered ceasefire between Tblisi and Moscow.  President Saakashvili also railed against the Russians saying, ""Twenty-first Century occupiers, who have no legal, moral or other right to be there and oppress people, are stationed in the heart of Georgia.""

On the other side of the  equation, however, the Russian military as well as South Ossetian forces denied an involvement in the gunfire incident.  In an interview with RIA Novosti, a South Ossetian spokeswoman, Irina Gagloyeva, asserted the following:  ""The South Ossetian side has nothing to do with it. There was no shelling from our side.""A Russian spokesperson said to the Interfax news agency, ""The claims that Russian servicemen were implicated in the shelling of the cortege do not correspond with reality.""August 2009 marked the one year anniversary of the war between Georgia and Russia over the breakaway republic of South Ossetia.On August 13, 2009, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin visited Abkhazia, where he promised to build a military base along the border with Georgia.  Putin also said that such a move would help guarantee the stability of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.  The Russian head of government said: ""Russia is going to deploy its armed forces in Abkhazia and take the necessary efforts to build a modern border guard system in cooperation with the relevant Abkhazian authorities."" He continued, ""All these factors are serious guarantees of the security of Abkhazia and South Ossetia."" Putin's pledge came on the first anniversary of the cease-fire, which ended Russia's war with Georgia over South Ossetia.  As might be expected, Georgia decried the move, characterizing it as ""yet another provocation,"" that could potentially ""escalate tensions"" in the region of the Caucasus.

Both Abkhazia and South Ossetia  declared independence from Georgia during a war in the 1990s, which  followed on the heels of the collapse of the former Soviet Union.  Both Abkhazia and South Ossetia  are recognized by Russia as sovereign states, but have nonetheless remained  internationally-recognized as Georgian territories.They have increasingly become flashpoints in the region.In October 2009, a  report commissioned by the Council of the European Union  placed the blame for the start of the 2008 war over the semi-autonomous region of South Ossetia on Georgia.  The report by the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on the Conflict in Georgia found that the war, which erupted on August 7, 2008,  was spurred when Georgian forces attacked the breakaway republic of South Ossetia, in an attempt to re-establish sovereign control. Still, the report did not cast Georgia as being the only guilty party.  It noted that the hostilities between the two sides led to provocative actions by both Georgia and Russia.  The report also acknowledged that after Georgia shelled South Ossetia, Russia responded by not only repelling the assault but, in fact, pressing further into Georgian territory. 

See ""Special Report"" below for more recent developments related to South Ossetia and Abkhazia.

Russia and Venezuela Forge TiesOn a visit to Russia in late September 2008, Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez met with his Russian counterpart, President Dmitry Medvedev, and  agreed to work on energy cooperation.The two countries were already ensconced in a process of building  economic links but Chavez and Medvedev were pursuing a pact that would include cooperation in the realm of energy production.

This cooperation was expected to concentrate on oil and gas production, but Chavez acknowledged that Russia had offered to assist Venezuela with a civilian nuclear power program as well.  The Venezuelan leader noted that his country was only following in the footsteps of other Latin American countries, such as Brazil and Argentina, which already was on its way to nuclear energy production.He also emphasized that Venezuela was only looking to nuclear energy for medical purposes and power generation.  Meanwhile, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin registered his willingness to enter into nuclear energy cooperation with Venezuela.

Russia and Venezuela were additionally moving into the realm of closer military ties.  To that latter end,  Russian ships were en route to the Caribbean Sea off the coast of South America to participate in joint military exercises with the Venezuelans.  Chavez was quick to note that the joint military exercises were not an indication of any military action saying, ""We are not going to invade anyone, or engage in acts of aggression toward anyone.""  However, he indicated that the action was being taken to show that Venezuela took its sovereignty seriously.  He said, ""But no one should mistake our intention -- we are prepared to do everything necessary to defend Venezuelan sovereignty.""Prospects of a Russian loan to Venezuela to help finance the purchase of Russian arms were being discussed on September 9, 2009.  Chief Russian foreign policy aide, Sergei Prikhodko, said that the Kremlin was considering such a loan to Venezuela.  The announcement came as Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez arrived in Moscow for meetings with Russian  President Dmitry Medvedev.

In addition to the possibility of an arms deal, the meeting was intended to establish multiple areas for bilateral cooperation.  To that end, President Medvedev's Press Secretary Natalya Timakova said, ""There are plans for the conclusion of documents and agreements on oil and gas cooperation, on ecology in the oil and gas industry, and also an agreement between the Justice Ministries.""

After his trip to Moscow, President Chavez confirmed in a weekly televised address that Russia had agreed to lend Venezuela over $2 billion for the purchase of weapons, such as 100 tanks and a series of anti-aircraft rocket systems, and were intended to boost the country's defensive capacity.  President Chavez noted that  the anti-aircraft rocket systems would make it difficult for Venezuela to be attacked.  He said, ""With these rockets, it is going to be very difficult for them to come and bomb us. If that happens, they should know that we will soon have these systems installed, [and] for an enemy that appears on the horizon, there it goes."" The move appeared to be in retaliation to a deal struck between Colombia and the United States to allow American troops access to Colombian military bases. Note: Both Russia and Venezuela have indicated a shared interest in opposing United States influence and hegemony on the global stage.Special EntryU.S. and Russia forge agreement to cut stockpiles of  nuclear weapons as Obama and Medvedev set new tone for bilateral relations

On July 6, 2009, United States President Barack Obama met with his Russian counterpart, President Dmitry Medvedev, for talks on their countries' respective nuclear arsenals.  Following three hours of discussion,  the two world leaders signed  an outline agreement aimed at reducing their countries' stockpiles of nuclear weapons.  The ""joint understanding"" was signed in a public ceremony in Moscow and would cut deployed nuclear warheads to under 1,700 on both sides  within seven years of a forging new accord.  That new accord would stand in replacement of the  1991 Start I treaty, which was set to expire at the close of 2009.

A statement from the White House explained that the new treaty would ""include effective verification measures"" and ""enhance the security of both the US and Russia, as well as provide predictability and stability in strategic offensive forces.""

While the terms of the new concord would still leave both countries with enough weaponry to destroy one another, the move was intended to stop the diplomatic ""drift"" away from cooperation on shared interests, which  had occurred in recent times.

To that end, President Obama said the United States and Russia were both ""committed to leaving behind the suspicion and the rivalry of the past."" He also noted that the new agreement was part of an initiative ""to reset U.S,-Russian relations so that we can co-operate more effectively in areas of common interest.""

For his part, President Medvedev said that the talks had been ""very frank and very sincere"" and were""without any doubt, the meeting we had been waiting for in Russia and the United States."" The Russian leader went on to state, ""I would like particularly to stress that our country would like to reach a level of cooperation with the United States that would really be worthy of the 21st Century, and which would ensure international peace and security.""

In addition to reduced levels of nuclear warheads and delivery systems, including intercontinental ballistic missiles, there were also provisions for submarine-launched missiles and bombers.

In a separate agreement, Russia said it would allow the United States military to  transport troops and weaponry across its territory to Afghanistan, where  the  war against resurgent Taliban and al-Qaida was ongoing.  This use of Russian territory to move troops and equipment into the conflict zone would foreclose the use of  routes through Pakistan, which have been  the target of  attacks by militants on a frequent and increasing basis.

In another development, Russia and the United States agreed to establish  a joint commission, which would facilitate greater cooperation on energy, fighting terrorism and dealing with narcotics trafficking.

In a particularly significant move, the two countries agreed to resume military cooperation, which was suspended in 2008 as a result of the  conflict between Russia and Georgia.

Yet unresoved was the prevailing source of controversy on both sides -- the  United States' plan to develop a missile defence shield system in Eastern Europe.  This proposal has been strenuously resisted by Russia, which eschews  greater American domination in its own backyard.In a move aimed at gradually moving the two countries toward consensus on the issue, both Obama and Medvedev said that they backed a joint study on the threat of ballistic missiles and the institution of a data exchange center.

President Obama, who characterized former President Vladimir Putin as having ""one foot in the old ways of doing business and one foot in the new,"" met with the prime minister  of Russia on July 7, 2009.

Special Report:Russia and United States respond to Iran's nuclear proposal; impact on Israel notedIn  September 2009, Iran put forth its package of proposals to the five  permanent United Nations Security Council members and Germany.  According to the independent United States-based entity, ProPublica, the five-page proposal, Iran called for  ""comprehensive, all-encompassing and constructive"" negotiations on a range of security issues, including global nuclear disarmament.  However, the document detailing Iran's latest proposals on its nuclear ambitions conspicuously failed to mention Iran's own nuclear program.

The United States reacted by registering dissatisfaction with the proposal package.  Philip Crowley, the United States Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs, said that the proposed mesaures failed to address the status of Iran's nuclear program.  He said, ""Our concern is that the response itself did not really address what is the core issue of the international community and the core concern, which is Iran's nuclear ambitions."" Conversely, Russia reacted by suggesting that the Iranian proposals signaled positive progress. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said, ""Based on a brief review of the Iranian papers my impression is there is something there to use.""  Lavrov also indicated that there would be no  oil sanctions against Iran. ""Some of the sanctions under discussion, including oil and oil products, are not a mechanism to force Iran to co-operate, they are a step to a full-blown blockade and I do not think they would be supported at the UN Security Council.""

The American and Russian responses showed divergent approaches to the Iranian nuclear issue, and suggested that consensus on the matter would  not be easily achieved.

The controversy surrounding Iran's nuclear program took on greater significance after the IAEA meeting, as discussed above.  If Russia was indicating that  it would not support strong oil sanctions against Iran, then what options would be available to countries such as the United States, which has made clear that consequences were in the offing if Iran failed to resolve the international community's concerns about its nuclear ambitions? 

Indeed, neither the United States nor Israel have ever actually foreclosed the possibility of targeted air strikes against Iran, which would be specifically aimed at preventing that country from obtaning a nuclear weapon. But Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin entered the fray, speaking against not only the imposition of new sanctions, but also targeted military action against Iran. Prime Minister Putin characterized any attack on Iran as ""very dangerous"" and warned that it would lead to ""an explosion of terrorism.""  That said, he also called on Iran to show ""restraint"" in its nuclear program and to be mindful of Israel's security concerns.  Prime Minister Putin said, ""This is a dangerous region and Iran should show responsibility, especially by taking into account Israel's concerns.""Earlier, the Israeli  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was reported to have  made a secret visit to Moscow to discuss the matter of  Russian arms sales to Iran and Syria.  At issue has been rising tensions between Israel and Russia over Moscow's arms sales to Iran and Syria. Of particular concern have been the transfers of weapons to the extremist Islamic organization, Hezbollah, in Lebanon -- a particular flashpoint even since the 2006 between Israel and Lebanon-based Hezbollah. In November 2009,  in a move that could be viewed as a tactical maneuver, Russia  announced in November 2009 that a nuclear power plant that it developed in southern Iran would not be launched in 2009 as scheduled.  In an interview with BBC News, Russian Energy Minister Sergei Shmatko said, ""We expect serious results by the end of the year, but the launch itself will not take place. ""The engineers have to reach their findings."" While Russia offered technical explanations on the record for the delay, there was growing consensus that the protracted process was actually linked with ongoing  conflict over Iran's nuclear activities and ambitions.Note that in 2010, Russia backed the United States-led move to impose harsh sanctions on Iran for its controversial  nuclear development program and failure to comply with international regulations on the matter.  Accordingly, the United Nations Security Council was able to move forward with sanctions against Iran.Special Entry:U.S. President Obama abandon's Bush era missile shield; Russia lauds move

On September 17, 2009, United States President Barack Obama  announced that his administration was abandoning the Bush-era missile defense shield program in Eastern Europe, which caused the grave consternation of Russia.  In its place, President Obama unveiled a ""phased, adaptive approach"" for missile defense on the European continent.  At a news conference in the White House, President Obama said, ""This new approach will provide capabilities sooner, build on proven systems and offer greater defenses against the threat of missile attack than the 2007 European missile defense program.""

President Obama explained that he made the decision based on an assessment of Iran's missile threat and the Pentagon's  ""phased and adaptive"" approach, which would ensure the American homeland defense. While President Obama acknowledged the threat posed by Iran, and although he insisted that he was committed to ""deploying strong missile defense systems which are adaptable to the threats of the 21st century,"" he also wanted to institute a plan that would be be appropriate and effective in responding to the current intelligence assessment of Iran's missile programs.  To that end, recent intelligence appeared to indicate that Iran's capacity to attach warheads to long-range missiles would not pose an immediate strategic threat to the United States and its allies. Indeed, Iran was more likely to pursue short-range and medium-range missile development.

President Obama noted, ""The best way to responsibly advance our security and the security of our allies is to deploy a missile defense system that best responds to the threats that we face and that utilizes technology that is both proven and cost-effective.""  He explained that the  new missile defense architecture would provide ""stronger, smarter and swifter defenses. ""

The plan would essentially nullify former President George W. Bush's plan to deploy 10 missile interceptors in Poland and a radar system in the Czech Republic as part of its European missile shield, charged with preventing European allies from missile threats by ""rogue states,"" such as Iran.  Bush's plan had been criticized by some as being impractical to implement.  Perhaps more significantly, Russia strongly opposed the missile defense shield concept and argued that it posed a security threat to the region.  The matter caused a devolution in positive relations between the United States and Russia at the time, with Russia warning of retaliatory moves.

Perhaps not surprisingly, Russia was now lauding the decision by the Obama administration to dispense with the Bush missile defense shield system.  Russian President Dmitry Medvedev welcomed the shift as ""positive"" and made clear that there were now ""good conditions"" for United States-Russia talks on dealing with missile proliferation. It was apparent that the ""reset button"" on bilateral relations between the two countries had, indeed, been pressed.

Meanwhile, Russia quickly announced that it would now scrap its own controversial plans to deploy missiles close to Poland.  That proposal had been advanced in response to the Bush missile shield plan.But now, as noted by Deputy Defense Minister Vladimir Popovkin during an radio interview in Moscow, ""Naturally, we will cancel the measures that Russia planned to take in response to the deployment of U.S. missile defense systems.""  He continued,  ""Common sense has finally prevailed over ambitions.""

For his part, President Obama said on an interview with CBS on September 20, 2009, that his decision was not dictated by Russian opposition.  He said, ""The Russians don't make determinations about what our defense posture is."" He continued, ""If the by-product of it is that the Russians feel a little less paranoid... then that's a bonus."" President Obama also noted that one of the bonus effects could be that the Russians might be more willing to work with the United States in dealing with ballistic missiles from Iran or nuclear development in Iran.Comprehensive talks between Russia and the United States consider missile defense, arms control and Iran

United States officials were expected to be in Russia on Oct. 12, 2009, for missile defense negotiations with Russian counterparts. The Russian were led by Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov while Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, Ellen Tauscher, was to head the United States delegation. After the groundwork has been established, further talks were set to take place later in the week between Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

Speaking ahead of the negotiations, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said the United States and Russia must advance strategic arms reduction.  In an interview with Russia's Channel Once, President Medvedev said, ""While dealing with non-proliferation, we must simultaneously deal with the limitation and reduction of strategic offensive potentials -- both carriers and nuclear warheads."" Medvedev continued, ""Today we have the chance to advance this process. We will be dealing with this. And I call on our American partners to do the same.""

With the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty set to expire on Dec. 5, 2009, President Medvedev said he believed Russia and the United States could reach a new strategic arms reduction accord.He observed, ""There is definitely a chance for the agreement, since the new U.S. administration has demonstrated interest in this issue.""  Medvedev also said he did not support the expansion of nuclear weapons states recognized by the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty. Striking a tone harmonious with his American counterpart, President Barack Obama, president Medvedev said, ""We are against the extension of the nuclear club. Otherwise the situation will get out of control. The world without nuclear weapons is an ideal which should be on our agenda.""

President  Medvedev also reiterated his appreciation for President Obama's decision to scrap the Bush-era missile defense shield plan, calling President Obama's new missile shield plans ""sensible.""  He additionally noted that Russia was eager to extend missile defense cooperation with the United States and Europe.

On October 13, 2009, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton traveled to Moscow to meet  with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. In addition to the issues related to missile defense and a new successor treaty aimed at strategic arms reduction, the two diplomats were reported to have discussed approaches to dealing with geopolitical challenges in  Iran, the wider Middle East, and Afghanistan, as well as possible joint work on climate change.

In an interview with the Newsweek's Russian edition, which was  published in the  German daily, Die Welt, and translated by Reuters,  Secretary Clinton said that her country and Russia found broad agreement on the issue of Iran's controversial nuclear program.  While there was no specific promise from Moscow to impose harsh santions on Iran if diplomacy failed, Secretary Clinton said, ""We have agreed to make diplomacy the priority with Iran. But if we are not successful, we will consider other steps."" She described her talks with Russian leaders as ""very constructive"" and noted that the United States and Russia  were in ""full agreement"" on the path before them.  The United States' top diplomat also lauded Russia for not following through  with plans to deliver high-grade S300 air defense missiles to Iran.  Secretary Clinton additionally addressed the Obama administration's plan to scap the Bush-era missile defense system in Eastern Europe saying, ""On the question of the missile shield, we are very open to cooperation with the Russians. We have made this clear to them. We believe that a joint missile defense would make sense.""On Dec. 21, 2009, Russia and the United States were reported to have made good progress on negotiations on a new strategic arms agreement.  In an off-side meeting at the Copenhagen Climate Change Summit, United States President Barack Obama met with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and expressed confidence that a new treaty would soon be signed. At issue was the impending expiration of the existing Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty and the need to forge a new agreement.Russia and United States Sign New Arms TreatyOn Feb. 24, 2010, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged her Russian counterpart, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, to move forward with efforts to finalize a new arms reduction treaty.  During a briefing, State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said the United States' top diplomat ""emphasized to the foreign minister that our negotiators are close to reaching an agreement and encouraged Russia to continue to move ahead, push hard so we can reach an agreement in the next couple of weeks.""  That timeline seemed to coincide with Russian expectations, since a Russian lawmaker, Konstantin Kosachyov, noted that discussions were underway on a new treaty to replace the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), which  expired on Dec. 5, 2009.

In March 2010, Secretary of State Clinton was in Moscow for meetings with Foreign Minister Lavrov. From Moscow, Clinton and Lavrov noted that a new START would soon be finalized.At a joint press conference with Lavrov, Clinton said, ""The results of the latest negotiation rounds lead us to believe we'll be reaching a final agreement soon."" At issue is a plan that would reduce the United States' stockpile of 2,000 strategic nuclear weapons, and Russia's stockpile of close to 3,000, be reduced to between 1,500 and 1,675 warheads respectively. There was, however, some dissonance on verification measures aimed at quantifying weapons and launch systems.

Meanwhile, as progress was being made on a successor treaty to START, United States President Barack Obama called for  a reduction in the number of nuclear weapons, as part of a changing national security strategy.  To this end, he said: ""The United States reaffirms our resolve to strengthen the non-proliferation regime to meet the challenges of the 21st century as we pursue our ultimate vision of a world without nuclear weapons."" As President Obama marked the  40th anniversary of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, he intimated new post-Cold War policy, saying: ""Our forthcoming Nuclear Posture Review will move beyond outdated Cold War thinking and reduce the number and role of nuclear weapons in our national security strategy, even as we maintain a safe, secure and effective nuclear deterrent.""  President Obama also said he would work to  seek ratification on the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, which was adopted by the United Nations in 1996, but which had yet to be enforced.  These statements appeared to reify President Obama's vision of a nuclear-free world, which was laid out in a keynote speech in Prague in 2009.  It also came ahead of a nuclear security summit, set to take place  in Washington D.C. in April 2010.

On March 24, 2010, the United States and Russia announced they had arrived at a breakthrough agreement that would pave the way for the establishment of a new START. Both President Obama and his Russian counterpart, President Dmitry Medvedev, were expected to sign the landmark accord, which provides for the reduction of long-range nuclear weapons on both sides, and sets the path for further  disarmament in the future. The accord was illustrative of the new texture of bilateral relations, marked by an increased level of cooperation and trust between the United States and Russia in the last two years.  ""Measures to Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms"" was expected to be signed on April 8, 2010, in the Czech capital of Prague, symbolically marking President Barack Obama's call for a world without nuclear weapons in that very city a year earlier.  The timing would also ensure that both the United States and Russia would be able to enter the forthcoming Summit on Nuclear Security with a joint claim of accomplishment.  They would also have the moral high ground in their efforts to pressure Iran to abandon its nuclear ambitions.

Lauding the treaty as the most comprehensive weapons control accord in two decades, President Obama declared:  ""With this agreement, the United States and Russia - the two largest nuclear powers in the world - also send a clear signal that we intend to lead.""  He continued, ""By upholding our own commitments under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, we strengthen our global efforts to stop the spread of these weapons, and to ensure that other nations meet their own responsibilities.""  Via his spokesperson, President Medvedev said the treaty ""reflects the balance of interests of both nations.""  As well, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that the treaty marked a ""new level of trust"" between the two countries.That being said, on April 8, 2010, President Obama and President Medvedev held private talks at Prague Castle ahead of the signing ceremony.  Later, both leaders signed their names on the new document that would significantly reduce the arsenal of nuclear weapons held by their respective countries. The two leaders of the countries controlling 90 percent of the world's nuclear weapons made it clear that membership in the global nuclear club came with extraordinary responsibility, and a vision of non-proliferation.  President Obama said, ""This day demonstrates the determination of the United States and Russia... to pursue responsible global leadership. Together, we are keeping our commitments under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which must be the foundation of global non-proliferation.""  Meanwhile, President Medvedev said: ""This is a win-win situation. No one stands to lose in this agreement. Both parties won ... the entire world community won.""  In effect, the fact that the two countries  were able to find consensus on such a complex matter, and the two leaders were able to sign one of the most important treaties in decades, signaled the anticipated ""re-setting"" of United States-Russian relations sought by the Obama administration in the United States when it came to power.

The difficult process of forging and signing  such a bilateral agreement would be followed by the equally challenging process of ratification in the United States Senate.  With an eye on this process, President Obama met in the Oval Office with the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator John Kerry (D-Massachusetts) and the ranking republican,  Senator Richard Lugar (R-Indiana) to discuss this imperative.  To the end, Senator Kerry said, ""A well-designed treaty will send an important message to the rest of the world that America is prepared to lead efforts with key stakeholders to reduce the threat of nuclear weapons."" It should be noted that the new START would also have to be ratified by the Russian Duma.  Nevertheless, ahead of a global security summit scheduled to take place in Washington, Russia and the United States would be able to claim the high ground on leadership and responsibility among nuclear-armed nation states. In November 2010, President Obama was calling on the United States Senate to ratify the treaty.  He characterized the need to do so as ""a national security imperative""  on November 18, 2010, demanding that the upper chamber of Congress act affirmatively before departing at the close of  the year.  Bringing as much pressure to bear, President Obama drew upon support from former secretaries of states and secretaries of defense from both political parties in the United States -- Republican and Democratic -- to emphasize the urgency in ratifying the treaty.  President Obama noted that  his country would not  ""afford to gamble"" with the matter.  He  emphasized that the United States could not risk alienating Russia, whose support would be needed in pressuring Iran, given that country's suspected program of nuclear proliferation.But delay was on the mind of  some Republican senators who rejected the president's call for a review process during the Senate's lame duck session of the outgoing Senate.Speaking to this issue, President Obama said: ""Every month that goes by without a treaty means that we are not able to verify what's going on on the ground in Russia. And if we delay indefinitely, American leadership on nonproliferation and America's national security will be weakened.""Note that despite heavy Republican opposition in the United States, the treaty was ratified in the United States Senate and then went through the ratification process at home in Russia. The new arms reduction treaty between the United States and Russia went into effect on Feb. 5, 2011, effectively replacing the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START).  Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and his United States counterpart, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, exchanged ratification documents pertaining to ""Measures to Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms"" or ""New START""  at a conference in Germany.  Secretary of State Clinton said that the treaty was ""another example of the kind of clear-eyed co-operation that is in everyone's interests.""  Foreign Minister Lavrov characterized the new treaty as ""a product of the understanding that unilateral approaches to security are counterproductive.""  He continued,  ""The treaty that enters into force today will enhance international stability.""

The ""New START"" would  significantly reduce the arsenal of nuclear weapons held by the United States and Russia; it would limit the United States' stockpile of 2,000 strategic nuclear weapons, and Russia's stockpile of close to 3,000, to between 1,500 and 1,675 warheads respectively.  ""New START""  was regarded as a  milestone in the decades-long thrust to decrease the chances of nuclearized warfare.  Indeed, it could arguably be characterized  as one of the most important treaties forged in a generationSpecial EntryModern-day spy scandal unfolds; implications for U.S.-Russia relations?Earlier, on June 28, 2010,  ten individuals using aliases were arrested in the United States for allegedly spying for the Russian government. According to the Justice Department of the United States, the ten individuals were charged with conspiracy to act as unlawful agents of a foreign government. Eight of the ten suspects were reported to have had ""long-term, deep-cover assignments"" in the United States. As well, nine of the ten suspects were charged with conspiracy to launder money. Five of the suspects appeared in a New York federal court where they were ordered to remain in jail pending hearings set for the end of July 2010. Other suspects soon faced court in Virginia. The arrests came after an investigation that went on for several years and, if convicted, the suspects could face five years in prison.

Authorities said they were in pursuit of an eleventh suspect.  That eleventh suspect was soon arrested in Cyprus and released on bail; he was subsequently reported to be missing after failing to present for a scheduled ""check in"" meeting with the Cypriot police.  An arrest warrant was issued for that individual as a result but reports soon emerged that he may have fled that country. The Cypriot authorities were now under fire for mishandling the situation; members of the opposition party in that Mediterranean country railed against the fact that an alleged spy was allowed bail rather than being subject to a detention order.Meanwhile, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, on a trip to Eastern Europe, made clear that the U.S. was committed to positive ties with Russia, the emerging spy scandal notwithstanding.  Secretary Clinton said, ""We're committed to building a new and positive relation with Russia."" She continued, ""We're looking toward the future.""  For its part, Russia has also indicated that the scenario would not affect closer bilateral relations with the United States.Indeed, only weeks ago, Russia backed the United States in advancing a plan for further international sanctions against Iran for its controversial nuclear program.  The United States-drafted proposal was passed in the United Nations Security Council with Russian support, effectively imposing harsh sanctions against Iran.By the first week of July 2010, plans were in the works for a Cold War era ""spy swap"" in which ten Russian agents would be deported  in exchange for the return of United States agents being held in Russia.  Those agents sought by the United States included a Russian nuclear scientist, a former Russian military intelligence agent and a former KBG agent who were jailed for spying on behalf of the United States.  There was also a former military intelligence agent jailed for spying for the United Kingdom.

The exchange ensued in Austria with the ten Russian agents boarding a flight to Moscow, and the four agents released by the Kremlin  boarding an American aircraft close to the main passenger terminals at the airport in Vienna. The entire exchange took a total of 90 minutes.

Perhaps not surprisingly, the two countries involved cast the spy swap in positive terms.  Russia said that the ten persons in United States custody facing charges there had been freed ""for humanitarian considerations.""  Russia also lauded the move as being illustrative of ""the general improvement of Russia-United States relations.""  Meanwhile, the United States was dismissing claims that only four agents were released in exchange for the ten Russians.  United States authorities made clear that the four in question were ""high value"" and garnered far more usable information in comparison to the ten Russians.  Moreover, the White House in the United States was playing up the fact that knowledge of the spy ring and plans for the spy swap had been in the works for several months before the Russians were ever arrested. Special EntryNuclear PoliticsMarch 2012 was  marked by the Nuclear Security Summit in South Korea, and attendance of global leaders from Russia, China, and the United States.  The summit agenda aimed at reducing the risk of nuclear terrorism.Ahead of the Nuclear Security Summit, United States President Barack Obama reiterated his call for  ""a world without nuclear weapons"" and advanced his foreign policy agenda that advocates  non-proliferation and the reduction of  nuclear weapons through increase diplomacy.

In a speech to students at South Korea's Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, President Obama said the United States -- the only nation to have ever used nuclear weapons -- was fully committed to  reducing its stockpile of nuclear arms.  The United States leader said his country had a""moral obligation"" to pursue strategic arms cuts.  President Obama also drew thunderous applause from the audience of students when he said that, as a father, he did not wish to see his daughters growing up in a world with nuclear threats. 

""I say this as president of the only nation ever to use nuclear weapons,"" Obama said. ""I say it as a commander in chief who knows that our nuclear codes are never far from my side. Most of all, I say it as a father, who wants my two young daughters to grow up in a world where everything they know and love can't be instantly wiped out.""

President Obama acknowledged his country's unique position in the world, but he noted that ""serious sustained global effort"" was needed to achieve his expressed hope for a nuclear weapons-free world.

The issue of nuclear proliferation has been at the forefront of the international purview given the ongoing concerns about North Korea's nuclear arsenal as well as Iran's nuclear ambitions.  To that latter end, President Obama was expected to meet with Russia's outgoing President Dmitry Medvedev on the matter of Iran's nuclear program -- an issue that has not always seen progress due to divisions among countries with veto power on the United Nations Security Council. With an eye on working cooperatively with such countries, President Obama pledged to work with Russia and China at reducing the risk of nuclear terrorism.

With regard to China, President Obama noted that he has called on Beijing to work directly with Washington and this offer ""remains open.""  He further noted that the Nuclear Security Summit in Seoul presented an opportunity for the United States and China to fortify bilateral relations.  He said, ""I think this is also an opportunity to build on the excellent cooperation and dialogue across all the dimensions of our relationship that we've been able to establish over the last three years""  The United States leader observed that the  summit ""shows the progress that the international community has made in preventing nuclear proliferation and making sure that we've secured nuclear materials.""  He continued,""And I know that's in the interest of both the United States and China.""

With regard to Russia,  the United States president said he hoped to follow up on the New Start Treaty (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty). 

The ""New START"" provided for the significant reduction of the arsenal of nuclear weapons held by the United States and Russia; it would limit the United States' stockpile of 2,000 strategic nuclear weapons, and Russia's stockpile of nearly 3,000 to between 1,500 and 1,675 warheads respectively. ""New START"" was regarded as a milestone in the decades-long thrust to decrease the chances of nuclearized warfare. Indeed, it could arguably be characterized as one of the most important treaties forged in a generation.

President Obama expressed hope there could be a deal forged with Russia for further strategic arms cuts with Russia as part of the nuclear disarmament agenda. ""Going forward, we'll continue to seek discussions with Russia on a step we have never taken before -- reducing not only our strategic nuclear warheads, but also tactical weapons and warheads in reserve,"" President Obama said.

That being said, President Obama was overheard telling his Russian counterpart President Dmitry Medvedev that  dealing with the European missile defense shield would have to wait until after the election.  The White House explained that President Obama was expressing the political reality of the campaign season  where rigorous diplomacy and negotiations would be difficult to accommodate.

President Obama addressed the issue of Iran's controversial nuclear development program, saying that time remained to resolve the deadlock through diplomacy.  ""But time is short,"" said President Obama. ""Iran must act with the seriousness and sense of urgency that this moment demands,"" he continued.

For its part, Iran has insisted that it has the right to develop nuclear development for peaceful civilian purposes.  On the other side of the equation, the West has asserted that Iran is seeking  to build nuclear weapons via its clandestine nuclear arms development program.  While Iran has been subject to sanctions as a result of its failure to fulfill its international obligations, international concurrence has not come easily due to objections from China and Russia.  However, President Obama made it clear that he intended to work with these two countries as he stated: ""Today, I'll meet with the leaders of Russia and China as we work to achieve a resolution in which Iran fulfills its obligations.""

Addressing the matter of North Korea's nuclear ambitions, President Obama made it clear that the United States held ""no hostile intent"" to that country, but warned that there would be ""no rewards for provocation.""Note:  In addition to the controversial and difficult issues of nuclear development in Iran and North Korea, the summit would also address the threats posed by nuclear terrorists, as well as radiological materials that could be used to construct a ""dirty bomb"" (i.e. a bomb that would spread radiological contamination rather than causing a nuclear explosion).  Also on the agenda was a plan for nuclear power stations to convert to low-enriched fuel.  Due to the complexity of  these issues, it was  unlikely that new agreements and concurrence would be found anytime soon despite the participation of 50 countries at the Nuclear Security Summit.  Notably absent from the list of participants  at the summit were North Korea and Iran.

Special Entry Russian President Putin says missile deal more likely with Obama than Romney In the first week of September 2012,  Russian President Vladimir Putin entered the fray of American presidential politics, characterizing United States President Barack Obama as ""a very honest man"" while disparaging Republican nominee Mitt Romney as being politically craven. In an interview with state media, President Putin said that if President Obama was re-elected in the November 2012 elections in the United States, he believed it was possible for a compromise agreement to be forged over the difficult issue of a United States' proposal for  missile defense system in Europe.  Russia has been opposed to the establishment of such a missile system in its geopolitical neighborhood; however, President Putin was signaling that a deal could be reached with an Obama administration in the United States that would satisfy the interests of both countries. He said, ""Is it possible to find a solution to the problem, if current President Obama is re-elected for a second term? Theoretically, yes.""  The Russian president went on to state the following: His desire to work out a solution is quite sincere. I met him recently on the sidelines of the G-20 summit in Los Cabos, Mexico, where we had a chance to talk. And though we talked mostly about Syria, I could still take stock of my counterpart. My feeling is that he is a very honest man, and that he sincerely wants to make many good changes.""  He continued, ""But this isn't just about President Obama."" The Russian head of state pivoted to talk about President Obama's rival for the presidency saying that although he could work with any American administration, there were limits to be considered.  He said, ""We'll work with whichever president gets elected by the American people. But our effort will only be as efficient as our partners will want it to be.""  President Putin  then launched into as sharp rebuke of Mitt Romney's claim that  Russia was ""without question"" the United States'  ""Number one geopolitical foe."" Putin said: ""As for Mr. Romney's position, we understand that this is to a certain extent motivated by the election race. But I also think that he was obviously wrong, because such behavior on the international arena is the same as using nationalism and segregation as tools of U.S. domestic policy. It has the same effect on the international arena when a politician, a person who aspires to lead a nation, especially a superpower like the U.S., proclaims someone to be an enemy.""  Returning to the contentious matter of the missile shield, President Putin posed the following rhetorical question: ""But what happens if Mr. Romney, who believes us to be America's No. 1 foe, gets elected as president of the United States? In that case, the system will definitely be directed against Russia."" It should be noted that President Putin's rare praise for President Obama stands in contrast to his attitude towards other American officials, or, American foreign policy in general.  Russia has blocked a number of United State-backed Security Council resolutions against Syria at the United Nations, has at times stymied efforts to pressure Iran on its nuclear development program, and has even accused the United States' Department of State of providing tacit verbal support of anti-government demonstrations after Russia's recent  disputed parliamentary elections. Special Report:

Boston terror bombings intersects with challenge of Islamic separatistm and extremism in Russia

On April 15, 2013, two bombs exploded along the path to the finish line of the Boston Marathon in the state of Massachusetts in the United States.  The explosive devices were believed to have been placed inside  backpacks and detonated remotely. Three people died  as a result of these apparent terrorist acts.  Meanwhile, there were more than 130 people hospitalized due to the intensely grave nature of so many injuries. It should be noted that due to the placement of the  explosive devices,  many of the victims endured horrific injuries to their lower extremities, with limbs severed as a result. Indeed, the scene of the tragedy displayed a traumatizing scene of dismembered and bloodied body parts along with the injured victims and shocked bystanders.

Thanks to the sheer quantity of photographic evidence from witnesses at the marathon taking pictures of the day's events, as well as cameras installed on commercial buildings, authorities were able to get a sense of the perpetrators and their actions.  On April 18, 2013, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) released photographs of two suspects and actively sought the public's assistance in apprehending those responsible. 

Later on the  night of April 18, 2013 -- presumably agitated by the realization that their pictures were being shared with the world -- the two suspects became engaged in a spate of violent activities with deadly consequences.  The two kiled a police officer on the campus of MIT University, carjacked a man in a Mercedes-Benz SUV, held him by gunpoint, identified themselves as the Boston marathon bombers,  and used his ATM card to withdraw $800 in cash from the car owner's bank account, before releasing him at a gas station in Cambridge.  The suspects then exchanged gunfire with police, with many stray bullets landing in the homes of people who lived in the hitherto quiet residential neighborhood of Watertown.  As well, one transit officer was seriously wounded in the mayhem.  The situation became even more intense when, during their attempted getaway, the two suspects hurled explosive devices at the police.  Residents of the neighborhood who witnessed the events said in interviews with the media that the devices looked like a combination of grenades and pressure cooker bombs.  Bomb detecting robots were soon dispatched to  the scene to determine the security of the area since the two men reportedly hurled an arsenal of weapons and explosive devices on the Watertown residential street. Meanwhile, the firefight between the suspects and police was ongoing. One suspect was shot in the exchange of gunfire with police and then was run over by a car as his accomplice made his escape.  The first suspect ultimately died as a result of his injuries, while the second suspect was captured after Boston and its surrounded areas was placed under lockdown for several hours. The second suspect would later be charged in the United States  with using a weapon of mass destruction.

In the early hours of April 19, 2013, details regarding the identities of the two suspects were beginning to surface.The suspect seen in the FBI photographs wearing the black cap,  and who had died as a result of the firefight with police, was identified as 26-year old Tamarlan Tsarnaev.The surviving suspect, who was seen in the FBI photographs wearing the white cap, was identified as his brother, 19-year old Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev.  The young men were of  Chechnyan and Avar (Dagestani) ethnicity.  The father of the two brothers had worked in the  former Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan, which is now independent;  the  Tsarnaev brothers spent some of their younger years there.  Anzor Tsarnaev was fired from his government job in Bishkek (the capital of Kyrgyzstan) when the war sparked again in Chechnya in 1999; the general view was that he lost his job due to his Chechen ethnicity.  The Tsarnaev family then moved to the Russian semi-autonomous region of Dagestan, close to the breakaway Russian region of Chechnya, which has been the site of an extremist separatist Islamic insurgency for about two decades. The entire family emigrated to the United States about ten years ago and settled in the  suburban Boston area of Somerville and Cambridge.  Tamarlan Tsarnaev was a legal resident of the United States and Dzhokhar  Tsarnaev had become a United States citizen in 2012.

Information about Tamarlan Tsarnaev suggested that he had a difficult time adjusting culturally to life in the United States, despite some success with a boxing career.  His decision to stop boxing on religious grounds appeared to have angered and perplexed his father, who had been socialized in the Soviet system and culture to hold a far more permissive and moderate attitude towards Islam.  Influenced by his mother's religious transformation to Islamic orthodoxy, Tarmalan Tsarnaev reportedly became increasingly hard line in his Islamic and extremist views, even alienating some members of his extended family. Ruslan Tsarni,  an uncle to the Tsarnaev brothers, was on the record with the media saying that as far back as 2009,  Tamerlan Tsarnaev was becoming more of an extremist Muslim, expressing what he described as ""this radical crap."" This trend appeared to have fueled a break in contact among family members.

It should be noted that the Russian government had Tamarlan Tsarnaev  on its radar, having requested that the United States authorities investigate him as early as 2011, due to suspicions of involvement with Islamic extremists and unspecified underground groups.  The FBI confirmed that they interviewed Tamerlan Tsarnaev in 2011, as requested, but found no cause for alarm at the time.

Tamarlan Tsarnaev certainly traveled out of the country for  extended periods of time, most recently in 2012 to visit his father who was now living in the Dagestan region of Russia.  However,  the actual time Tamarlan Tsarnaev  spent  with his father in Dagestan was limited to one month, leaving the rest of the period a mystery and open for interpretation.  It was  possible (although not confirmed) that he attended a terrorist training camp -- perhaps in the Caucasus region or elsewhere. But even without such an expedition, Tamarlan Tsarnaev may very well have been radicalized in a less ""official"" manner.  While politicians in the United States were eager to suggest that Tamarlan Tsarnaev  was radicalized  out of the country, it was apparent that his increasingly extreme Islamic views were part of a personal transformation taking place in the home he shared with his mother.  Still, it was after an overseas trip more recently that Tamarlan Tsarnaev created YouTube postings  called ""Terrorists,""  which featured videos from a militant extremist in Dagestan  known as Amir Abu Dudzhan. In one posting, Dudzhan is shown holding a Kalashnikov rifle and declaring: ""Jihad is the duty of every able-bodied Muslim.""  It was apparent that Tamarlan Tsarnaev  was  ideologically inspired by  Islamic extremism and radicalism, while being sympathetic to  the Chechnyan and Dagestani separatist and Jihadist causes.

Of course, the motivation for Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev to join his brother in carrying out terrorist attacks remained more of a matter for debate.  Significantly more well-adjusted to American life  than his brother, the younger Tsarnaev was a seemingly successful student at the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth, with a number of American friends,  an active social life, and hopes for a medical career. It was difficult to determine if Dzhokhar Tsarnaev shared his brother's Jihadist views, or, if he was simply motivated by his relationship with his brother.  To that end, there were some suggestions that Tamerlan Tsarnaev may have  ""brainwashed"" his younger brother into participating in his terrorist agenda.  For his part, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's  posts on the Russian social media site, Vkontakt, made it clear that he self-identified as Islamic in terms of religion and ""world view,"" and Chechnyan in terms of ethnicity and culture.  He also posted  links to Islamic and pro-Chechnyan independence websites.

There seemed to be bewilderment among United States intelligence circles about the idea that the Chechnyan drive for independence and war with Russia should be transported to American terrain.  But it was not clear that Chechnyan independence was the driver for the two Tsarnaev brothers to commit acts of terror.

In fact, it should be noted that Islamic militants  operating under the aegis of the  Caucasian Mujahedeenin denied any involvement in the Boston marathon terror attacks, emphasizing that their conflict was with Russia.  However, as discussed below, the militant Islamic insurgency in the North Caucasus has steadily expanded past Chechnya's borders to neighboring territories, such as Dagestan and Ingushetia, and the cause itself has moved past establishing  an independent Chechnya to a broader Jihadist goal in the Caucasus.  It was quite possible that personal transformation to radical Islam meshed with the Jihadist agenda for the older Tsarnaev brother, and he drew the younger one into the fold.

But it was also possible that these two young men -- neither of whom were victims of economic strife as is the case for many Chechens, Dagestanis, and Ingushetians at home -- were motivated for different reasons. It was possible that they were inspired by a broader ideological (read: global Islamic Jihadist) sensibility, reminiscent of the September 11, 2001 hijackers, or the Nigerian Christmas Day bomber. All the young men in these cases were well-educated, spent several years in Western countries, quite possibly suffered from cultural alienation to some degree as a result of the experience, thus driving them to take on radicalized Islamic extremist identities, and ultimately -- to terrorist actions on the basis of religion.

On April 22, 2013, On April 22, 2013, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was reported to have told investigating authorities that he and his brother acted alone, rather than in concert with an organized Jihadist or terror enclave, and that their actions were motivated by their Islamist beliefs, and inspired by the goal of global Jihadism. By the last week of April 2013, a clearer picture of the motivation for the bombings was emerging as reports surfaced about the radicalization of Tarmalan Tsarnaev as early as 2010 -- a track that seemed to run parallel with the increasingly religious orientation of his mother. Both mother and son, as noted above, were wiretapped by Russian intelligence and appeared to have discussed the possibility of participating in Jihad. As such, it was apparent that Islamic extremism within the Tsarnaev family fueled the terrorist actions of the two brothers. Special Entry NSA leaker finally escapes Russian airport purgatory and accepts asylum in new homeland of Russia Mid-2013 was dominated by questions about the fate of Edward Snowden -- a former contract employee of the National Security Agency  (NSA) -- who leaked classified information to the public and then fled the United States.  The revelations about the United States' secret surveillance program highlighted the post-September 11, 2001, debate over privacy rights versus national security interests in the United States. The matter emerged in the public purview via an article in the United Kingdom-based Guardian newspaper.The Guardian's piece focused on  a phone records monitoring program by the  National Security Agency (NSA), which gathers millions of phone records in the United States as part of a database for national security purposes.  The phone records or so-called ""meta-data"" theoretically do not include the actual content of conversations.  Instead, the meta-data  concentrates on points of contact, frequency of contacts, location data, call duration, and other such patterns that could presumably assist in determining whether terror suspects are in communication with persons in the United States. The United States soon took legal action against Snowden for absconding with sensitive intelligence documents and then  disclosing that classified information. Snowden was charged  with theft of government property, unauthorized communication of national defense information to  someone without a security clearance, and willful communication of classified intelligence. The latter two charges were violations covered under the Espionage Act. After fleeing the United States, Snowden headed to the Chinese territory of Hong Kong, and from there he was in Russia en route to his final destination -- political asylum in another country.  With the United States making it difficult for the NSA leaker to reach his final destination for asylum, Snowden was quite literally trapped  at the  ""in transit"" area of Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport,  which was not technically Russian territory.  United States authorities were demanding the NSA leaker's extradition to face justice for the crimes outlined above.  But while Russian President  Vladimir  Putin  did not seem particularly enthused with Snowden's presence at the  Sheremetyevo Airport, he nonetheless quickly foreclosed the notion of honoring United States requests for Snowden to  be returned to the United States, saying the fugitive leaker had not broken  any Russian laws.  Meanwhile, the motives behind  Snowden's leaking activities were receiving even greater scrutiny. Snowden expanded his leaking agenda beyond the realm of exposing the NSA's surveillance activities to sharing information about the clandestine infiltration of the Chinese computer network intelligence with the Chinese themselves.  Accordingly, it seemed that Snowden crossed the line into the realm of foreign espionage.  Snowden offered a sense of his motivation for this line-crossing during a live online chat with the Guardian newspaper on June 24, 2013.  Snowden declared: ""All spying is wrong.""  Apparently, from the perspective and personal judgment of Snowden, no covert activities by the United States targeting foreign governments were acceptable.Left unconsidered for Snowden was the matter of whether or not his fellow Americans concurred with his stance, or, if Americans might appreciate the  utility of long-standing clandestine intelligence services in  the interests of keeping the citizenry safe. Still, Snowden believed he was on a mission to expose this ""wrongdoing"" to the world.  The matter of how to go about accomplishing that goal was revealed in an interview with Snowden that was published by the South China Morning Post on the morning he departed Hong Kong.  In that  South China Morning Post interview, the fugitive leaker admitted that he took the job as an NSA contract worker with Booz Allen Hamilton for the specific purpose of acquiring and releasing sensitive classified intelligence.  Snowden was now on the record stating the following:  ""My position with Booz Allen Hamilton granted me access to lists of machines all over the world the NSA hacked. That is why I accepted that position about three months ago.""  This admission was unlikely to strengthen his credibility, since it suggested that Snowden did not simply happen upon data he believed should be shared with the citizenry. Instead, he actively sought employment  as a contractor to the NSA for the expressed purpose of acquiring classified intelligence data, which he then illegally released not only to the public -- but also to foreign powers.  For his part, President Barack Obama weighed in on the Snowden affair on June 27, 2013, when he dismissed the notion of personally pressuring his Chinese and Russian counterparts regarding extradition.  Speaking from a news conference in Senegal (Africa) where he was on an overseas trip, the president said that he was concerned about the documents Snowden might have in his possession.  ""That's part of the reason why we'd like to have Mr. Snowden in custody,"" Obama said. The president continued, said. ""But what I think we're going to continue to do is make sure that we are following the various channels that are well established and the rules that are well established to get this thing done.""  President Obama dismissed the notion of using tactics beyond the traditional outlets available, saying that he  was ""not going to be scrambling jets to get a 29-year-old hacker.""Snowden appeared to draw closer to a future in Russia in July 2013, when the fugitive leaker applied  for political asylum in Russia. Snowden indicated that he would pursue temporary refuge in that country until he could be guaranteed ""safe passage"" to an unspecified Latin American country in the future.Noteworthy was the fact that around the same time, Russian President Putin pugnaciously asserted that Moscow had ""no intention"" of handing over Snowden to the United States.  The Russian leader opened the door for Snowden to successfully find asylum in his country, pending one condition.  Putin said: ""If he [Snowden]  wants to stay here, there is one condition: He must stop his activities aimed at inflicting damage on our American partners, no matter how strange it may sound coming from my lips.""For his part, United States President Obama addressed the unfolding imbroglio with Russia over the Snowden affair as follows: ""We don't have an extradition treaty with Russia. On the other hand, Mr. Snowden, we understand, has traveled there without a valid passport and legal papers.  And we are hopeful the Russian government makes decisions based on the normal procedures regarding international travel and the normal interactions law enforcement have.""It should be noted that in a statement released via Wikileaks, Snowden had argued that the United States condemned him to a life of ""the extra-legal penalty of exile"" as a punishment for his crimes.  He continued, ""Although I am convicted of nothing, it has unilaterally revoked my passport, leaving me a stateless person.""  Left unstated by Snowden was the fact that on June 21, 2013, the United States government levied legal charges of theft of government property and two violations covered under the Espionage Act.  Clearly, in so doing, there was nothing ""extra-legal"" being undertaken by the United States government.  It should also be noted that the revocation of a passport is standard procedure for persons charged with crimes and deemed to be flight risks. According to federal law,  an American citizen's passport can be revoked due to ""an outstanding federal warrant of arrest for a felony"" as provided under Title 22 of the U.S. Code. Thus, despite Snowden's claim that he was now left a stateless person due to the revocation of his passport, in truth, he remained a citizen of the United States, retaining all constitutional rights as a United States citizen, while at the same time being subject to prosecution on United States soil for his violations  of the law. Moreover, United States Attorney General Eric Holder expressly noted that Snowden would not  be facing draconian legal consequences, such as the death penalty, if he were extradited to face justice.Snowden made the announcement to seek asylum in Russia while meeting with human rights activists  and politicians at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport where he also condemned the West for preventing him from reaching his ultimate destination in  Latin America.  This was in apparent reference to the fact that the Bolivian president's aircraft was denied access to certain European countries' air space on suspicion that Snowden was aboard.  Snowden said, ""Some governments in Western European and North American states have demonstrated a willingness to act outside the law, and this behavior persists today... This unlawful threat makes it impossible for me to travel to Latin America and enjoy the asylum granted there in accordance with our shared rights.""  In fact,  sovereign states  are fully within their rights to control access to their air space,  even if the outcome produces diplomatic imbroglios.Left unsaid by Snowden was whether or not he would be meeting the conditions of the Russian government that he refrain from further harming the interests of the United States if he wanted to take refuge in Russia. It was not known how Russia intended to respond to this request from Snowden, given an impending meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and United States President Barack Obama at a summit in Russia in September 2013.  Obviously, by granting Snowden even temporary asylum in Russia, there would be a deleterious effect on relations with the United States.  Indeed, the decision to allow Snowden to meet with human rights activists and political figures at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport was already raising the ire of the United States.As noted by the White House itself,  the prospect of Russian asylum would violate Moscow's own stated position that Snowden should avoid  further damage to American national security.  White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said: ""Providing a propaganda platform for Mr. Snowden runs counter to the Russian government's previous declarations of Russia's neutrality and that they have no control over his presence in the airport.  It's also incompatible with Russian assurances that they do not want Mr. Snowden to further damage U.S. interests.""On Aug. 1, 2013,  Edward Snowden was finally able to leave Russian airport purgatory and enter asylum in new homeland of Russia. Snowden's Russian lawyer said that his client received the legal documents necessary to exit the Sheremetyevo Airport's in-transit zone and enter Russian territory.Anatoly Kucherena declined to comment on the details of Snowden's Russian living arrangement, saying,  ""His location is not being made public for security reasons, since he is the most pursued man on the planet.""  He did, however, disclose that Snowden would be staying in a private home of American expatriates. Kucherena also acknowledged that Snowden intended to ""build a new life in Russia""  and  noted that the NSA fugitive leaker was looking forward to learning about Russian culture.  Kucherena added that while Snowden's legal permit allowed him temporary asylum for one year, the fugitive leaker did not foreclose the possibility of pursuing Russian citizenship in the future.The movement of Snowden into Russian territory, and with Snowden's activities indicating a clear pursuit of a life in his new Russian homeland, marked a shift in Snowden's status.  Indeed, it reflected Russia's official decision to support the NSA leaker wanted by the United States government.  The move would invariably and deleteriously affect United States relations with Russia.Yury Ushakov, foreign policy adviser to President Putin, tried to make light of the situation, saying the Snowden affair was ""rather insignificant"" and should not negatively impact relations with the United States.  However, the United States seemed to be taking  Russia's decision to grant asylum to  Snowden quite seriously. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said: ""We're extremely disappointed that the Russian government would take this step despite our very clear and lawful requests in public and in private to have Mr. Snowden expelled to the United States to face the charges against him.""With United States President Barack Obama due to travel to Russia to attend the G-20 summit, the fact of the matter was that the Snowden affair could potentially cause  the United States leader to cancel his  planned private meeting with Putin, his Russian counterpart.  As noted by  White House Press Secretary Jay Carney, ""We're evaluating the utility of a summit in light of this and other issues.""  Democrat Senator Chuck Schumer was more forthright in his assessment of the situation.  He said Russia's decision to grant Snowden asylum was a ""stab in the back"" and recommended that President Obama consider relocating the G-20 summit  to a country other than Russia.Not surprisingly, in the first week of August 2013, President Obama cancelled his meeting with President  Putin, although the United States president did intend to travel to Russia to attend the G-20 summit in St. Petersburg. A statement from the White House read as follows: ""We have reached the conclusion that there is not enough recent progress in our bilateral agenda with Russia to hold a U.S.-Russia Summit."" The White House statement continued, ""We believe it would be more constructive to postpone the summit until we have more results from our shared agenda.""The Russian Kremlin expressed disappointment over President Obama's decision.  As before, Putin's foreign policy adviser, Ushakov, tried to downplay the situation  and move toward more productive ground, saying,  ""Russian representatives are ready to continue working together with American partners on all key issues on the bilateral and multilateral agenda."" But at home in the United States, it seemed that White House national security advisers had unanimously backed the decision to cancel the meeting with Putin.Special Report on Syrian Crisis:Report of chemical weapons usage surfaces and exacerbates Syrian Crisis; has the ""red line"" been crossed and will international powers now involve themselves in the Syrian civil war?Summary:Since early 2011, anti-government protests have spread and escalated across the Arab world; Syria emerged as an addition to the list of countries experiencing unrest in March 2011. At first, protesters stopped short of demanding the resignation of President Bashar al-Assad, instead demanding greater political freedom and efforts to end corruption. For his part, President Assad announced he would advance a reform agenda, which would include lifting the emergency laws that had been in place for decades, and increased rights to the country's disenfranchised Kurdish population. These moves were aimed at quelling the rising climate of unrest gripping the country. But over time, as protests continued, and as the Assad regime carried out a hard line crackdown on dissent, tensions escalated between the government and the protesters.In mid-2011, the United Nations Security Council and the Arab League respectively issued condemnations of the violence in Syria. As well, the United Nations Human Rights Council called for an independent inquiry into the violent crackdown on dissent. Meanwhile, global leaders were calling for President Assad to step down from power, given the brutality of the Syrian regime's crackdown on protesters. As of 2012, the bloody crackdown by the Assad regime on anti-government protesters was ongoing. In fact, the crackdown appeared to become more relentless in places such as Homs and Aleppo. Despite widespread condemnation from the West, a United Nations Security Resolution on the situation in Syria was subject to veto by Russia and China. A subsequent vote in the United Nations General Assembly overwhelmingly condemned Syria for its brutal crackdown. A prevailing truce, brokered by the joint United Nations/Arab League envoy, Kofi Annan, was established in the interests of preventing further bloodshed; however, it was revealed to be an exercise in theory rather than practice and eventually the United Nations monitoring mission ended in failure.Syria has, meanwhile, been subject to sanctions by various countries and was sliding into pariah status in the international community. Assassinations, alleged  massacres, geopolitical tensions with Turkey and Israel,  and most recently, suspicions about the use of chemical weapons, have since mired the Syrian landscape.  Indeed, it was increasingly clear that Syria had slipped into a state of civil war and was facing a devastating humanitarian crisis.  That crisis reached new heights in August 2013 with claims that Syrian forces launched a chemical attack on the outskirts of Damascus.  Was this the clear sign that United States President Barack Obama's ""red line"" had definitively been crossed? And would the international community become more involved in the Syrian crisis?  The answers to those questions were yet to be determined.Chemical weapons issue resurfaces:On Aug. 21, 2013, Syrian opposition activists and rebels said that chemical weapons had killed hundreds of people on the outskirts of Damascus. They said that government forces launched a major bombardment on rebel forces in the area of Ghouta using rockets with toxic agents.  The Syrian government dismissed the accusations as  ""illogical and fabricated.""  The Syrian military further said that rebel forces were suffering major defeat and were using claims of chemical attacks to draw attention away from the fact that they were losing the war.The claims and counter-claims set up rival theories that could not be verified simply by looking at the videotaped footage of victims that immediately surfaced online.  Stated differently, while the international media was able to obtain visual evidence of victims who had died, that footage could not prove whether they died as a result of conventional military bombardment or due to exposure to toxic substances.  However, there was an increasing chorus of disturbing assertions by medical staff that the victims, particularly children, appeared to have suffered suffocation and blurred vision.  As well, further videotaped footage was starting to surface about the purported attacks, this time showing  victims enduring convulsions or distinctly encountering breathing problems.  In an interview with BBC News, Professor Alexander Kekule of the Institute for Medical Microbiology at Halle University in Germany, admitted that the videotaped images of the victims certainly suggested they had been subject to  a chemical agent of some kind.  However, he made a point of noting that none of the victims showed signs that they had been exposed to  chemicals such as  sarin or organophosphorous nerve agents.The international community seemed initially wary to accept the claims of chemical attacks, perhaps with the memory of the inconclusive chemical weapons claims so fresh in their minds from earlier in the year (2013).  Only recently, United Nations investigators traveled to Syria to look into those earlier claims.  In August 2013, the United Nations convened an emergency meeting to discuss the newest chemical attack claims and its immediate response was to seek clarification on the situation in Syria.  As noted by  Maria Cristina Perceval, Argentina's United Nations Ambassador, ""There is a strong concern among council members about the allegations and a general sense that there must be clarity on what happened and the situation must be followed closely.""That being said, individual countries -- such as France  and the United Kingdom-- were going further and demanding that United Nations inspectors who were already investigating the earlier allegations of  chemical attacks in Syria now look into these fresh claims.  The United States echoed their call via White House spokesperson Josh Earnest, who said: ""The United States is deeply concerned by reports that hundreds of Syrian civilians have been killed in an attack by Syrian government forces, including by the use of chemical weapons, near Damascus earlier today. We are formally requesting that the United Nations urgently investigate this new allegation. The United Nations investigative team, which is currently in Syria, is prepared to do so, and that is consistent with its purpose and mandate.""  Both the European Union and the Arab League entered the fray, adding their own voices to the call for United Nations inspectors to go look into the matter.Perhaps not surprisingly, Russia had a different view and noted that the timing of the fresh claims of chemical attacks came just as United Nations inspectors were in Syria to investigate the chemical claims from earlier in 2013  The Russian foreign ministry said, ""This makes us think that we are once again dealing with a premeditated provocation.""  Indeed, there was a legitimate question as to why the Syrian government would choose to use chemical weapons at a time when United Nations inspectors were ""in country"" and especially given United States President Barack Obama's 2012 famous statement that his country would not be involving itself in the Syrian crisis unless the Assad regime used chemical weapons -- essentially crossing a vital ""red line"" -- that could augur international military action.There was incremental movement in that direction  on Aug. 22, 2013, when  the United Kingdom, France, and Turkey all demanded that the  international community take a strong stand against the Syrian regime, if the chemical weapons attack was verified.France went further with French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius saying that if  the claims of a chemical attack proved to be true, a ""reaction of force"" would result. The United Kingdom issued a similar threat via the British Foreign Office, noting,  ""We believe a political solution is the best way to end the bloodshed""  but also warning  that the government of Prime Minister David Cameron ""has said many times we cannot rule out any option that might save innocent lives in Syria.""  Meanwhile, Turkey goaded the United Nations about its symbolic ""foot dragging"" as Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu declared: ""All red lines have been crossed but still the United Nations Security Council has not even been able to take a decision.""On Aug. 23, 2013, United States President Barack Obama offered comments on the alleged use of chemical weapons in Syria saying that the claims constituted a ""big event, of grave concern.""  In an interview  with  CNN, President Obama noted that the conflict in Syria would have a bearing on United States national interests ""both in terms of us making sure that weapons of mass destruction are not proliferating, as well as needing to protect our allies, our bases in the region.""  Nevertheless, the United States leader struck a cautious note, reminding journalists that his country  was still in the process of seeking confirmation on the matter of chemical weapons usage; however, he asserted that if the allegations proved to be true, the crisis would ""require America's attention.""  Left unsaid was the nature of that attention.  For his part, President Obama urged prudent action, tacitly reminding people of the consequences of  the reckless military intervention of his predecessor, George W. Bush, into Iraq.  The United States president said: ""Sometimes what we've seen is that folks will call for immediate action, jumping into stuff, that does not turn out well, gets us mired in very difficult situations, can result in us being drawn into very expensive, difficult, costly interventions that actually breed more resentment in the region.""Around this time, Russia maintained its belief that the use of chemical agents might be a provocation by the opposition.  Still, Russia  was now urging Syria to cooperate with an  ""objective investigation"" by United Nations chemical weapons experts.  United Kingdom Foreign Secretary William Hague indirectly addressed this suggestion that the use of chemical agents was a provocation by rebel forces saying, ""I know that some people in the world would like to say this is some kind of conspiracy brought about by the opposition in Syria. I think the chances of that are vanishingly small and so we do believe that this is a chemical attack by the Assad regime on a large scale.""United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon demanded an immediate investigation to clear up the matter.  He said: ""I can think of no good reason why any party -- either government or opposition forces -- would decline this opportunity to get to the truth of the matter.""  Ban also emphasized the fact that  any use of chemical weapons -- by any actor or party -- would be a violation of international law, which would inevitably result in ""serious consequences for the perpetrator.""Key Developments:On Aug. 24, 2013, the international medical assistance organization, Medecins Sans Frontieres, or MSF,  (""Doctors Without Borders"" in English), confirmed that it had treated as many as 3,600 patients with ""neurotoxic symptoms,"" and noted that 355 of those patients had died.  This news from MSF augmented the claim that the use of chemical agents were used in Syria in the final week of August 2013 although  the international medical assistance organization was careful to note that it could not ""scientifically confirm"" the use of chemical weapons.  MSF Director of Operations Bart Janssens said: ""MSF can neither scientifically confirm the cause of these symptoms nor establish who is responsible for the attack. However, the reported symptoms of the patients, in addition to the epidemiological pattern of the events, characterized by the massive influx of patients in a short period of time, the origin of the patients, and the contamination of medical and first aid workers, strongly indicate mass exposure to a neurotoxic agent.""  He continued, ""This would constitute a violation of international humanitarian law, which absolutely prohibits the use of chemical and biological weapons.""On Aug. 25, 2013, the Assad regime again dismissed charges that it had used chemical toxins or poisons on Syrian citizens but did agree to allow United Nations inspectors to travel to suspected sites of chemical attacks to investigate the prevailing accusations.  The United Nations said that Syria had agreed to allow investigators to operate in an environment of safety, even promising a ceasefire during inspections.  However, as the convoy of  vehicles  carrying chemical weapons inspectors was driving to the Damascus suburb to carry out the investigation on Aug. 26, 2013, they were fired upon by snipers.  The first vehicle in the convoy was repeatedly hit by gunfire, forcing it to discontinue its path.  The other vehicles in the convoy, however, were able to get to the suspected sites and collect samples from victims, despite coming under gunfire.  The United Nations released a statement describing what happened and condemning the attack on its convoy as follows:  ""The first vehicle of the Chemical Weapons Investigation Team was deliberately shot at multiple times by unidentified snipers in the buffer zone area. It has to be stressed again that all sides need to extend their cooperation so that the team can safely carry out their important work.""Should the United Nations' investigation end with evidence of the use of chemical agents, toxins, or poisons, the general consensus was that such confirmation would bolster the case for an international intervention into Syria.  There were few hopes that veto-wielding Russia and China would sanction the use of force in Syria at the United Nations Security Council.  However, there was a pertinent precedent for international action on the basis of humanitarian reasons.  Specifically, the NATO campaign against Serbia to protect the people of  Kosovo was undertaken without a United Nations Security Council Resolution and against the wishes of Russia -- an ally of Serbia.It was, thus,  possible that Western powers could again go the NATO route -- this time in Syria.A meeting of leaders from the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and other NATO allies was in the offing to discuss possible options.United States Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel appeared to be reflecting the Obama administration's cautious stance regarding action in Syria when he said: ""The United States is looking at all options regarding the situation in Syria. We're working with our allies and the international community. We are analyzing the intelligence. And we will get the facts. And if there is any action taken, it will be in concert with the international community and within the framework of legal justification.""Of course,  the official report on the suspected chemical weapons usage in Syria by the United Nations was expected to take weeks to prepare.  As such, the United States was indicating that there was a ""clear"" and ""compelling"" case to be made of those charges against the Assad regime in Syria.  On  Aug. 30, 2013, United States Secretary of State John Kerry released an unclassified intelligence report on the matter.  Secretary of State Kerry said: ""Read for yourselves the evidence from thousands of sources. This is the indiscriminate, inconceivable horror of chemical weapons. This is what Assad did to his own people.""The United States' top diplomat also delivered the shocking claim that  more than 1,400 people were killed in the chemical attack -- at least 400 of whom were children.France was also giving weight to the United States' claims regarding a massive chemical attack in Syria, with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault  releasing a report in parliament.  That report went so far as to note that while the Syrian army had already -- and repeatedly -- used chemical weapons against the Syrian people, on Aug. 21, 2013, it launched an attack using ""massive use of chemical agents."" The French report further alleged that the chemical attack at that time ""could not have been ordered and carried out by anyone but the Syrian government.""  The French report additionally noted that  Syria's arsenal of chemical weapons was ""massive and diverse"" and  included both the nerve agent, sarin, and the toxic known agent, VX.France was, therefore, maintaining its stance that there should be an international response to Syria's use of chemical weapons. On the issue of France's role in that response, Prime Minister Ayrault said,  ""France is determined to penalize the use of chemical weapons by Assad's regime and to dissuade with a forceful and firm response.""  He also indicated that France was working with international partners to build a coalition that would carry out a possible course of action against Syria.  The French government was being very emphatic about the obligation of world powers to respond to the use of chemical weapons in defiance of international conventions. As stated by French President Francois Hollande on Sept. 3, 2013: ""When a chemical massacre takes place, when the world is informed of it, when the evidence is delivered, when the guilty parties are known, then there must be an answer."" The French leader urged other European countries to show unity on the issue.The claims about Syria's use of chemical weapons  by the United States and France were augmented by the statement of NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen, who declared that he was personally convinced that a chemical attack had, indeed, taken place, and that the Assad  regime was responsible for that attack.  That being said, there was no suggestion that NATO would be involved in any intervention into the  Syrian crisis in the manner in which the regional security bloc was engaged in Libya.On Sept. 4, 2013, United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said that any intervention into the Syrian crisis should have the blessing of the United Nations, and urged the Security Council to take action.  He also declared,  ""This is a larger issue than the conflict in Syria. This is about our collective responsibility to humankind.""  Left unsaid by Secretary General Ban was the fact that veto-wielding Russia and China were not eager to accommodate a resolution that would authorize such intervention.United States weights its options:Meanwhile, even as the evidence was increasing to support the claim of a chemical weapons attack in Syria, the political will to build an international coalition to act against Syria was eroding.  At issue was a parliamentary vote in the United Kingdom's House of Commons urging an international response to the Syria chemical  weapons crisis.  The vote came amidst British Prime Minister David Cameron's vociferous condemnation of Syria's apparent use of chemical weapons, and his suggestion that the United Kingdom would join the United States and France in delivering some kind of punitive action against Syria. But when the parliamentary vote went down to defeat in the House on Commons on Aug. 29, 2013,  it was apparent that the United Kingdom would not be a player in any kind of military intervention.Irrespective of the political developments across the Atlantic, in the United States, President Barack Obama on Aug. 30, 2013, made clear that he was  still considering  the full range of options in response to Syria's use of chemical weapons against its own citizens.Referring to the aforementioned report on the suspected chemical weapons usage in Syria released by Secretary of State Kerry, President Obama said, ""As you've seen, today we've released our unclassified assessment detailing with high confidence that the Syrian regime carried out a chemical weapons attack that killed well over 1,000 people, including hundreds of children. This follows the horrific images that shocked us all.""With an eye on showing why the use of chemical weapons required a response, President Obama said, ""This kind of attack is a challenge to the world. We cannot accept a world where women and children and innocent civilians are gassed on a terrible scale.""  He continued, ""So, I have said before, and I meant what I said that, the world has an obligation to make sure that we maintain the norm against the use of chemical weapons.""In this way, the United States president was making it clear that the international community had an obligation to respond to Syria's use of chemical weapons -- an act that was undertaken in defiance of international law and in contravention to international norms.President Obama indicated that several options were under review, as he noted, ""Now, I have not made a final decision about various actions that might be taken to help enforce that norm. But as I've already said, I have had my military and our team look at a wide range of options.""That being said, President Obama noted that a long-term campaign involving a ground force in Syria (reminiscent of Iraq) were not among those possibilities. He expressly said, ""We're not considering any open-ended commitment. We're not considering any boots on the ground approach. What we will do is consider options that meet the narrow concern around chemical weapons."" Evidently, although President Obama  believed there was a moral obligation to act against Syria for its use of chemical weapons, he was not eager to see the United States mired in another war in the world's most volatile region.  Stated differently, it was through the prism of the Iraq debacle that the United States leader was viewing his options for dealing with Syria.Syria's stance:Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has repeatedly denied that his forces launched  any chemical attacks. The Syrian leader has warned of a wider Middle Eastern war if  foreign countries decide to move forward with military action against Syria.  That wider war could occur if Assad decided to react to a yet-to-occur military strike by international powers on Syria.  Some of the possibilities available to Assad would include retaliatory attacks on pro-Western allies of the United States, such as Israel, Jordan, and Turkey.  But the reality was that Syria's military already had its hands full fighting the civil war at home.  Moreover, Syria likely could not risk sparking the ire of Israel,  with its own well-armed military, or Jordan, which hosts United States fighter jets, missiles and troops, or Turkey -- a NATO member state.  Indeed, an attack on any NATO country, such as Turkey, would prompt a response from the entire security alliance.Note on Russia's position:Russia has maintained the view that the notion of a  chemical attack by the Syrian government was inconceivable.  Russia has also indicted that it would block a resolution in the United Nations Security Council authorizing a use of force against Syria.  However, in early September 2013, Russian President Putin indicated some softening of his stance as he noted that he could be persuaded to change his mind if provided with clear evidence of a chemical attack.  Russia has also long advocated for a negotiated or diplomatic settlement to the Syrian crisis.Status update:On Sept. 8, 2013, the European Union called for no action to go forward with regard to Syria until the findings on the chemical agents were made available by the United Nations investigative team.  As well, plans for a full vote in the United States Congress authorizing use of force against the Syria regime were cancelled.At issue was an unexpected diplomatic breakthrough that emerged when United States Secretary of State John Kerry uttered a (seemingly) off-hand remark during a  news conference in London on Sept. 9, 2013 with British Foreign Secretary William Hague.  Secretary of State Kerry said that President Assad could prevent a military strike on  Syria if he  handed over ""every single bit"" of his chemical weapons to the international community.  At the time, Secretary of State Kerry said that he did not expect Assad to respond to this call; but, in fact, the remark appeared to have sparked fresh possibilities for a diplomatic solution with Russia championing the idea of subjecting Syria's chemical weapons stockpile to international auditors, and then placing them under the aegis of international jurisdiction. Syria -- Russia's client state in the Middle East -- was almost immediately scrambling to say that it would be willing to move in this direction. That stance by Syria functioned also as an admission by the Syrian regime that it was, in fact, in possession of chemical weapons.  Until that moment, the Assad regime would not even acknowledge that reality.On Sept. 10, 2013, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem offered a public admission of the Assad regime's chemical weapons stockpile when he said:  ""We are ready to inform about the location of chemical weapons, halt the production of chemical weapons, and show these objects to representatives of Russia, other states and the United Nations."" He continued, ""Our adherence to the Russian initiative has a goal of halting the possession of all chemical weapons.""On the night of Sept. 10, 2013, United States President Obama delivered a national address on the Syrian issue.  Originally, the speech had been regarded as an opportunity for the president to build congressional support -- then, at anemic levels -- for authorizing strikes against Syria, and assuring a war-weary and skeptical  nation that such action was necessary. Now, however, the speech had a two-fold purpose -- to bolster that aforementioned case against Syria, but also to address the emerging diplomatic channel.As regards the former objective, President Obama presented a succinct case for acting against Syria.  President Obama emphasized his conviction that the Assad regime was responsible for the chemical toxins attack that ensued around Ghouta on Aug. 21, 2013, characterizing the scene of death as  ""sickening,"" reminding the global community that such an  attack was  a violation of international law, and warning Americans that it  posed a threat to United States national security.But the president also opened the door to a negotiated settlement on the issue of Syria's chemical weapons arsenal and usage. He said that the Russian plan to report Syria's chemical weapons arsenal and place them under the aegis of international jurisdiction constituted ""encouraging signs"" and announced that he would pursue a ""diplomatic path.""  The president said that his top diplomat, Secretary of State Kerry, would travel to Geneva in Switzerland to  meet his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, with an eye on pursuing a negotiated settlement on the issue of dealing with Syria's chemical weapons.President Obama offered cautious support for this path forward, saying, ""It's too early to tell whether [the plan] would succeed, and any agreement must verify that the Assad regime keeps its commitments. But this initiative has the potential to remove the threat of chemical weapons without the use of force, particularly because Russia is one of Assad's strongest allies.""  President Obama defended his decision to consider military strikes against Syria, arguing that the current diplomatic opening was only possible as  a result of the credible threat of military force by the United States.  Accordingly, the United States leader made it clear that his country's armed forces would maintain their posture, saying: ""Meanwhile, I've ordered our military to maintain their current posture, to keep the pressure on Assad and to be in a position to respond if diplomacy fails.""While United States pundits parried opinions over the effectiveness and utility of President Obama's speech, a poll from CNN showed that while a majority of Americans remained skeptical about involving the country in the Syrian crisis,  an overwhelming majority expressed support for President Obama's approach to Syria.  In precise terms, there was a split decision on whether or not the president's case for strikes with 47 percent of Americans saying the president had done so and  had 50 percent saying that he had not.  However, 61 percent of Americans said they favored President Obama's ""wait for diplomacy and hold steady with the threat of action"" approach, as set forth in his national address.On Sept. 11, 2013, Russia officially handed over its plan for  placing Syria's stockpile under international control to the United States.  Discussion over its contents was expected to take place in Geneva, Switzerland, between United States Secretary of State Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov.Those negotiations would be of a bilateral nature.The Obama administration announced that in addition to Secretary of State Kerry's meeting with Foreign Minister Lavrov, the United States' top diplomat would also  meet with the United Nations-Arab League special envoy on Syria, Lakhdar Brahimi.On that very day, difficult discussions also commenced in the United Nations Security Council -- with particular emphasis among the permanent veto-wielding members, United States, United Kingdom, France, Russia, and China -- over the proposition and the associated United Nations resolution.The diplomatic path was not without serious obstacles.  Russia was demanding that the United States withdraw its threat of force, while France -- the United States' ally on the issue of action against Syria -- was crafting a United Nations Security Council resolution that would include a provision for precisely such action, should Syria fail to comply with the dictates of the plan.  At issue was France's inclusion of a Chapter VII provision (of the United Nations charter), which would effectively authorize  the use of force if Syria failed to adhere to its stated obligations.For its part, Russia advocated for a non-binding declaration supporting its initiative.At stake  in that initiative was a  demand for Syria to provide a full audit of its chemical weapons -- including varieties of toxins and storage locations -- within 15 days, as well as procedures facilitating the transfer of control  over those chemical substances, and ultimately, their destruction.  Of course, the issue of destruction itself presented a disagreement between Russia and Syria with the latter not keen on that aspect of the plan.  Still, with the client state of Syria reliant on Russia to save the regime from United States strikes, it was likely that the arsenal of chemical toxins would ultimately be set for elimination.Complicating the diplomatic  path was an opinion editorial piece penned by Russian President Vladimir Putin, which was published  by the New York Times.  At the more conventional level, the piece included a fulsome plea for diplomacy by Putin as follows:  ""The potential strike by the United States against Syria, despite strong opposition from many countries and major political and religious leaders, including the pope, will result in more innocent victims and escalation, potentially spreading the conflict far beyond Syria's borders.""Putin also urged international action via global instruments of jurisprudence, noting that any actions should go through the United Nations Security Council, which stood as ""one of the few ways to keep international relations from sliding into chaos."" Putin also offered the reasonable argument that the United Nations could go down the road of obsolescence as its precursor, the League of Nations, if ""influential countries bypass the United Nations and take military action without Security Council authorization.""Left unstated by the Russian leader, however, was the fact that his country's penchant for United Nations authorization for the use of force was not at play during the Soviet Union's invasion of Hungary, the Czech Republic, and  Afghanistan, or even  its limited engagement in the Georgian territory of South Ossetia most recently.The most incendiary element in  Putin's editorial was perhaps his chastisement of President Obama's declaration on United States' exceptionalism.  Putin argued against that claim, stating: ""And I would rather disagree with a case he made on American exceptionalism, stating that the United States' policy is What makes America different...it's what makes us exceptional. It is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional, whatever the motivation.""  This statement was a stunning example of irony coming from a world leader who declared to his fellow Russians in February 2013:  ""We are a victorious people! It is in our genes, in our genetic code!""The Obama administration responded to this provocative opinion piece by Putin a day later on Sept. 12, 2013 with White House Press Secretary Jay Carney  saying, ""It's worth also pointing out there's a great irony in the placement of an op-ed like this, because it reflects the truly exceptional tradition of this country of freedom of expression.""  Carney then went on to note that freedom of expression and free speech were ""on the decrease in Russia.""  Carney also used the occasion to place the burden of the success of a diplomatic path on Russia, noting that the Russian president had placed his ""prestige and credibility on the line"" in offering a proposal to Syria to turn over its chemical weapons.The Putin versus Obama contretemps aside, the diplomatic channels remained open.  On Sept. 12, 2013, the United Nations announced that it had  received documents from Syria, effectively acceding to the Chemical Weapons Convention, which prohibits the production and use of chemical weapons. Syrian Ambassador to the United Nations,  Bashar Ja'afar, said, ""Legally speaking Syria has become, starting today, a full member of the (chemical weapons) convention.""The move was the first significant indication that Syria was attempting to meet the demands of the international community.  Syrian President Assad  said in an interview with Russian media that  now that those documents had been dispatched, the chemical weapons audit data would be submitted within 30 days of signing the Chemical Weapons Convention.  But Assad appeared to be reticent about relinquishing his control over the situation, arguing that Syria's assent to the Russian plan was ""not unilateral"" and that his country would only accept it ""if America stops military threats and if other countries supplying the rebels  with chemical weapons also abide by the agreement."" United States Secretary of State Kerry quickly disposed of the notion that Assad was calling the shots, warning the Syrian leader that ""this is not a game.""Kerry also indicated that he viewed Assad's promise to submit chemical weapons data with suspicion.  Kerry instead asserted the following in regard to Syria's chemical weapons audit: ""It has to be real. It has to be comprehensive. It has to be verifiable. It has to be credible. It has to be timely and implemented in a timely fashion. And finally there ought to be consequences if it doesn't take place.""On Sept. 13, 2013, a preview of the highly anticipated United Nations' report on Syria's suspected use of chemical weapons emerged in the public purview. The chief chemical weapons inspector, Ake Sellstrom, acknowledged that  the report was complete but that its release would be decided by the secretary general of the United Nations.  The United Nations report was not expected to expressly assign blame for the use of chemical weapons in Syria, although according to sources, it would augment existing findings about the horror that unfolded in Ghouta, and its scientific evidence based on blood, urine, and soil samples would provide compelling suggestions as to the party responsible for the chemical weapons attack.United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon indicated the findings from the United Nations inspectors would ""overwhelmingly"" confirm that chemical weapons were used in Syria.  Speaking from the United Nations Women's International Forum, the head of the United Nations did not elaborate on which entity -- the Syrian regime or the Syrian rebels -- were responsible for the use of chemical weapons in that country; however, Ban was heard saying that Syrian President Assad  was guilty of ""crimes against humanity.""  Ban also said, ""Therefore, I'm sure that there will be surely the process of accountability when everything is over.""Meanwhile, negotiations were ongoing in Geneva (Switzerland) between the top diplomats from the United States and Russia respectively -- Secretary of State Kerry and Foreign Minister Lavrov -- with leaks indicating that the two men enjoyed good rapport.  The negotiations were being characterized as ""constructive"" and went late into the wee hours of Sept. 14, 2013, suggesting that climate was ripe with the possibility of forging a deal.Chemical Weapons DealOn Sept. 14, 2013,  United States Secretary of State Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov announced that a breakthrough agreement had been reached and that diplomacy had won the day. Speaking at a joint news conference with his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Lavrov, Secretary of State John Kerry said of the concord: ""If fully implemented, this framework can provide greater protection and security to the world.""The agreement , titled ""Framework for Elimination of Syrian Chemical Weapons,""  calls for a full accounting of its chemical weapons stockpile within one week, the destruction of all  production equipment  by November 2013, and the elimination  or transfer of the arsenal of chemical weapons by the middle of 2014. Achieving the objectives of the agreement promised to be difficult.  A one week deadline for a full audit of Syria's chemical weapons arsenal was strenuously aggressive.  As well, the destruction of production equipment and chemical toxins by 2014 was considered unprecedented since previous processes of this nature have typically taken several years to complete.  Moreover, there would be complicated questions yet to address, such as how to ensure the safety of international inspectors in Syria.It should also be noted that agreement on a United Nations Security Council resolution mandating Syrian disarmament on chemical weapons still promised to be potentially fractious.  Russia was reluctant to the notion of adding a Chapter VII provision (authorizing the use of force if Syria reneged on its obligations) to the resolution, although Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov intimated that the provision could be added in the future in a worse case scenario.  As such, the United States was not expected  to press for that particular inclusion at this time.The diplomatic breakthrough and the  agreement itself were thus  being lauded by all veto-wielding members of the United Nations Security Council (the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Russia, and China), as well as the broader United Nations and NATO.  But with the same lack of diplomatic restraint shown by Russian President Putin in his opinion editorial in the New York Times, Syria's Assad regime hailed the breakthrough agreement as a ""victory"" for that country. Syrian Reconciliation Minister Ali Haidar declared in an interview with Russian media, ""It's a victory for Syria achieved thanks to our Russian friends.""United States Secretary of State Kerry quelled Assad regime's bravado warning on Sept. 15, 2013 that the United States retained its right to carry out punitive strikes against Syria, if that country did not meet its publicy stated international obligations. Secretary of State Kerry said, ""If diplomacy has any chance to work, it must be coupled with a credible military threat.""  ""We cannot have hollow words in the conduct of international affairs,"" Kerry added.Already, President Obama in the United States had reminded the Syrian regime that while the agreement was ""an important step"" in the right direction,  his country reserved the right to act against Syria for failing to meet its obligations.  The United States leader said, ""If diplomacy fails, the United States remains prepared to act.""  Indeed, the United States Pentagon noted that the United States military remained in a posture poised for military strikes against Syria.Within the rebel ranks, the agreement was being regarded with scorn and bitterness.  Indeed, the military leader of the anti-Assad Free Syrian Army, General Salim Idriss, dismissed the deal as irrelevant, saying, ""All of this initiative does not interest us. Russia is a partner with the regime in killing the Syrian people."" Idriss also cast the deal as a Russian plan intended to gift the Assad regime with more time, and as such, he  vowed to keep up the fight.United Nations chemical inspectors confirm sarin attack; implicate Assad regime --By the third week of September 2013, the United Nations released its report in which it confirmed that chemical weapons were used in Syria.  The report by scientific experts stated that the banned chemical nerve agent, sarin, was dispersed using rockets into the Damascus suburb of Ghouta. The United Nations inspectors said that they had been able to procure significant evidence upon which to base their conclusions.  That conclusion, in the words of the inspectors, was as follows: ""The environmental, chemical and medical samples we have collected provide clear and convincing evidence that surface-to-surface rockets containing the nerve agent sarin.""The report stopped short of assigning blame for the use of sarin, however the forensic details of the weapons appeared to implicate the Syrian government in the chemical weapons attack.  Specifically, the report detailed the size and  shape of the munitions,  and the precise direction from which the munitions had been fired.  These elements foreclosed the possibility that rebel forces were responsible for the chemical weapons attack, as alleged by the Assad regime, and as suggested by President Putin of Russia.Indeed, the inspectors were able to carry out standard ordinance identification and crater analysis to conclude that two types of rockets had been used.  Meanwhile, using angular measurements from the points where rockets had struck to their points of origin, the inspectors were able to note that the point of origin was a Syrian military complex.  The identification of the rockets, along with size and sophistication of the launchers,  and finally the angular plot analysis, together bolstered the unofficial assessment that the Syrian government and not the insurgents were responsible for the chemical attack on Ghouta.The details of the report also suggested that the attack was more lethal than previously thought.  First, based on the remnants of a warhead recovered by inspectors, it was clear that its capacity of sarin was quite large at around 56 liters. Second, the low temperature at the time of the attack  meant that the sarin would prevail on the ground levels, even penetrating the lower levels of buildings where, according to the report,  ""many people were seeking shelter.""After a briefing of the United Nations Security Council, which included a presentation of the report's findings by Dr. Ake Sellstrom  -- a leading  chemical weapons experts --United Nations Secretary Ban Ki-Moon offered the following assessment: ""The report makes for chilling reading.  The findings are beyond doubt and beyond the pale. This is a war crime.""  Secretary General Ban also stayed away from assigning blame to any particular party; however, he said that he hoped the seriousness of the situation would spur a new diplomatic solution to the Syrian crisis.Such a hope was unlikely to be realized.  Already Russia  was downplaying the report as unconvincing.  Russia's ambassador to the United Nations, Vitaly Churkin, suggested that there remained several unanswered questions and said, ""We need not jump to any conclusions.""  Russia later went further and claimed the United Nations finding were ""one sided.""  Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said, ""We are disappointed, to put it mildly, about the approach taken by the U.N. secretariat and the U.N. inspectors, who prepared the report selectively and incompletely.""He continued, ""Without receiving a full picture of what is happening here, it is impossible to call the nature of the conclusions reached by the U.N. experts ... anything but politicized, preconceived and one-sided.""French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius responded to Russia's critique  of the United Nations inspectors' report saying, ""We are surprised by Russia's attitude because they are calling into question not the report, but the objectivity of the inspectors... I don't think anybody can call into question inspectors that have been appointed by the U.N.""The United Kingdom ambassador to the United Nations, Mark Lyall Grant, noted that the evidence pointed to a sophisticated chemical attack at the hands of the Assad regime. He said,  ""This was no cottage-industry use of chemical weapons."" Pointing to the variety of munitions and the trajectories that had been plotted, Grant stated: ""In our view, that there is no remaining doubt that it was the regime that used chemical weapons.""United  States ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, acknowledged that in the aftermath of Iraq, there was justifiable skepticism.  But referring to the scientific evidence presented the aforementioned expert, Sellstrom, she said that it was important to focus on the facts.  Powers said, ""We understand some countries did not accept on faith that the samples of blood and hair that the United States received from people affected by the Aug. 21 attack contained sarin. But now Dr. Sellstrom's samples show the same thing. And it's very important to note that the regime possesses sarin, and we have no evidence that the opposition posses sarin.""The United Nations itself entered the fray to defend the work of its chemical weapons experts who endured being shot at in Syria, in order to procure copious amounts of samples, and then carry out extensive analysis in record time.  United Nations spokesperson, Martin Nesirky, declared: ""The findings in that report are indisputable. They speak for themselves and this was a thoroughly objective report on that specific incident.""  Nesirky also emhasized the fact that there was an assiduously cross-checked chain of custody of all the environmental and biomedical samples used in the chemical weapons inquest.It should be noted that an analysis of the United Nations' chemical inspectors' report  by the Arms Control Association, made it clear that the findings were fair, factual, and convincing.  The  Arms Control Association drew attention to the annexes of the United Nations' chemical inspectors' report, stating,  ""The additional details and the perceived objectivity of the inspectors buttress the assignment of blame to Bashar al-Assad's Syrian government.""  As well, it should be noted that a separate investigation of the use of chemical weapons in Syria was carried out by Human Rights Watch, which also concluded that the Assad regime -- and not the rebels -- were behind the sarin attack.  Indeed, Human Rights Watch concluded that  sarin-filled shells had been fired from a military base in Syria supervised by Maher Assad -- the brother of the Syrian president.In the aftermath of the release of the report by the United Nations, the United States reminded Syria -- and indeed, the world -- that it remained under threat of punitive action for its use of chemical weapons, and was now subject to the provisions of the Russian-American compromise discussed above.  To that end,  Secretary of State John Kerry emphasized that his country would not tolerate any delays in  the process of auditing and destroying Syria's chemical weapons. Secretary of States Kerry said, ""If Assad fails in time to abide by the terms of this framework, make no mistake, we are all agreed -- and that includes Russia -- that there will be consequences.""  To that end, efforts were underway to move forward with a Security Council resolution against Syria.United Kingdom Ambassador Grant warned that the  Security Council resolution against Syria was intended to compel Syria to abide by its promise to abandon  its chemical weapons program.It should be noted that in an address to the United Nations General Assembly on Sept. 24, 2013, United States President Barack Obama called for a robust  United Nations Security Council resolution on Syria's chemical weapons.  President Obama said that a strong resolution was needed ""to verify that the regime is keeping its commitments"" to remove or destroy its chemical weapons arsenal.Special EntryGeorgia warns Russia against backing independence claims of Georgia breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia --On Feb. 4, 2014, just ahead of the opening of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi (Russia), Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili of Georgia warned Russia that it should refrain from  taking any positions that might support the independence claims of the Georgian breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.Relations between Russia and Georgia have long been tense since the early 1990s when Georgia declared its independence from the Soviet Union.  Relations devolved further over the years as Russia has supported the independence inclinations of the two  Georgian breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.  But relations between Georgia and Russia hit a nadir in 2008 when the two countries fought a brief war over South Ossetia.  Since then, they have had no diplomatic ties.With Russia in the international spotlight as it hosts the 2014 Winter Olympics, Georgia was adamant about ensuring that Russian President Vladimir Putin would not use the spotlight to advance the independence causes of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.  Of note was the fact that Russia's Olympic security zone was expanded into Abkhazia,  which was less than 25 miles away from Sochi.Prime Minister Garibashvili went to so far as to suggest that his country considered boycotting the Olympics in Russia.  During a meeting with European Union and NATO officials in Belgium, he said, ""It was a tough decision not to boycott the Games...But if there are any surprises we will of course react adequately.""Editor's Note:Since the final years of the Soviet Union, Russian-backed separatists in South Ossetia have sought to break away from Georgia and join North Ossetia, which is currently an autonomous region in Russia.  While South Ossetians assert their right to self-determination, Georgia considers such separatist aspirations as a threat to its territorial integrity.The dispute descended into a civil war in 1991, though a Russian-mediated ceasefire in 1992 ended the armed conflict and established a general framework by which to resolve the dispute. Despite the presence of Russian, Georgian, and Ossetian peacekeepers, tensions remain high and, in 2004, the situation once again descended into armed conflict. In January 2005, Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili announced a peace plan under which South Ossetia would receive a high degree of autonomy and economic incentives, though South Ossetian leaders continued to reject any attempt to put the disputed territory under Georgian rule.The geopolitical dimensions of the conflict have growing increasingly important as Russia has sought to use its military support for South Ossetia as leverage against Georgia's pro-Western government.  November 2006 marked the time of an overwhelmingly supported independence referendum in South Ossetia, which was intended to augment the thrust for sovereignty.  But Georgia rejected such independence aspirations and warned that it could provoke a war.In April 2007, the Georgian parliament approved legislation creating a temporary administration in South Ossetia  The move evoked an outcry from South Ossetian separatists and contributed to devolving  tensions with Russia.  The situation was no less stable two months later when  South Ossetian separatists accused  Georgia of  attacking the capital of Tskhinvali with mortar and sniper fire.Peace talks between Georgia and South Ossetia in October 2007, which were hosted by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE),  saw no progress.In early 2008, following  Kosovo's secession from Serbia, South Ossetia  called for international recognition of its self-avowed sovereignty and  independence from Georgia.  However, such recognition was not forthcoming at the broad level although the Russian parliament called on the Kremlin to indeed recognize South Ossetia (and Abkhazia)  as independent.In April 2008, the Georgian power-sharing agreement, which accorded significant autonomy but not actual sovereignty, was rejected by South Ossetia, which insisted on  complete independence.In  August 2008, Georgia was carrying out a full military offensive in South Ossetia, intended to ""restore constitutional order"" to the breakaway region.  Russia was responding with military action of its own.  The situation left the region on the brink of full-scale conflict and in a state of crisis.  By mid-August of 2008, a truce had been negotiated under the stewardship of the French government; this truce aimed to bring an end to the crisis.Meanwhile, ethnic Abkhazs in the  strategically located province of Abkhazia on the Black Sea  have sought to assert their independence from Georgia.  In 1991, war erupted as Georgian troops battled Abkhaz forces, alleged to have the backing of Russia and various northern Caucasus militant groups. More than 250,000 ethnic Georgians fled Abkhazia because of the fighting, fueling accusations that Abkhaz forces carried out a campaign of ethnic cleansing.Throughout the 1990s, the United Nations (U.N.), the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), and the Group of Friends (consisting of American, British, German, French, and Russian envoys) have attempted to negotiate a resolution to the conflict, but the situation remains a stalemate.  Abkhazia, which is economically isolated as a result of a Georgian embargo, operates as a de facto protectorate of Russia.  The geopolitical dimensions of the conflict have grown increasingly important, as Russia has sought to use its military support for Abkhazia as leverage against Georgia's pro-Western government.  For its part, Georgia has accused Russia of seeking to informally annex Abkhazia.  Nevertheless, Georgia has offered Abkhazia a high degree of autonomy, but insists on preserving its territorial integrity. Abkhazia, meanwhile, continues to demand independence.The 2008 conflict between Georgia and Russia over South Ossetia affected Abkhazia as well.  The  French-brokered peace agreement that was intended to end that crisis included implications for both South Ossetia and Abkhazia.It should be noted that a report commissioned by the Council of the European Union  placed the blame for the start of the 2008 war over the semi-autonomous region of South Ossetia on Georgia.  The report by the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on the Conflict in Georgia found that the war was spurred when Georgian forces attacked the breakaway republic of South Ossetia, in an attempt to re-establish sovereign control. Indeed, the report read: ""The shelling of Tskhinvali [the capital of South Ossetia] by the Georgian armed forces during the night of 7 to 8 August 2008 marked the beginning of the large-scale armed conflict in Georgia."" The report unambiguously concluded that the attack by Georgia was not justified by international law as follows:  ""There is the question of whether [this] use of force... was justifiable under international law. It was not.""Still, the report did not cast Georgia as being the only guilty party.  It noted that the hostilities between the two sides led to provocative actions by both Georgia and Russia.  The report also acknowledged that after Georgia shelled South Ossetia, Russia responded by not only repelling the assault but, in fact, pressing further into Georgian territory.  While Russia withdrew its forces several days later when a ceasefire was hammered out, it nonetheless retained a military presence in both South Ossetia and the other breakaway republic of Abkhazia, which was also technically under Georgian rule. The report found that while Russia's initial actions -- responding to attacks on its own personnel in South Ossetia -- were justified, its continued advance into Georgian territory ""went far beyond the reasonable limits of defense.""  The report also found that the destruction that ensued after the ceasefire went into effect was ""not justifiable by any means.""The report further dismissed Georgian claims that Russia  carried out a large-scale incursion into South Ossetia ahead of the outbreak of war, noting that this accusation could not be substantiated.  The European Union-sponsored report  would only allow that there was some evidence of a low-level military build-up by the Russians in the area ahead of the conflict.Perhaps not surprisingly, both Russia and Georgia interpreted the findings through an ideological prism most suited to their respective agendas. Russia asserted that the report had rendered an ""unequivocal answer"" on the question of who started the war.  On the other side of the equation, Georgia said that the report showed that Russia had been spoiling for a fight throughout.It should be noted that the report also registered the human toll of the conflict. Approximately  850 people  died in August 2008, more than 100,000 were forced to flee their homes to escape the crossfire of violence, and to date, about 35,000 people remain displaced.Humanitarian aid agencies have warned that there is a refugee crisis continuing in the region.Special Entry on Ukraine's  Uprising and Russian annexation of CrimeaSpecial Report:Following landmark uprising in Ukraine, Russia annexes Crimea in new East-West confrontation; anxieties raised over Russian nationalist ambitions to recapture Soviet-era territorySummary:Turbulence and turmoil have  characterized the landscape in Ukraine. Tensions initially flared in late 2013 in response to Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych's decision not to move forward with a pending association agreement with the European Union.  That decision brought more than 100,000 protesters to the streets to rally against what they saw as Ukraine's movement towards greater control by Russia.  Indeed, the general consensus was that President Yanukovych had bent to pressure by President Vladimir Putin of Russia to step away from the European Union Association Agreement and instead embrace a customs union with Russia.By the start of 2014, another flare of protests ensued in Ukraine in response to legislation passed by members of parliament loyal to President Yanukovych. The laws at stake were intended to curb the free expression of political opposition and curtail public protests.  The passage of such legislation raised the ire of Ukrainians, particularly those aligned with the opposition, and alarmed the West  with the United States and European Union worried about the Ukraine's slide into autocracy under Yanukovych.  In a twist of irony, the very laws intended to suppress mass action actually spurred exactly that end as mass protests attracting tens of thousands of  people once again rocked Ukraine.  As January 2014 entered its final week, concessions by President Yanukovych to include members of the opposition in government yielded no positive results.  Instead, the unrest spread to the eastern part of the country.  With the situation deteriorating, the prime minister and the government resigned, and the Ukrainian parliament repealed the controversial anti-protest laws.In mid-February 2014, the turmoil re-ignited as police tried to clear the main protest camp.  Ukraine was again thrust into a renewed state of turbulence and turmoil. A truce was forged on Feb. 19, 2014, but only after more than two dozen people died.  That truce collapsed a day later, effectively returning the capital city of Kiev to a battle zone and leading to an increasing death toll.  Yet another agreement was forged in which the president conceded to many of the demands of the opposition.  But the deal appeared to have come to late to appease an enraged populace.  By Feb. 22, 2014,  President Yanukovych had fled to the eastern part of the country while his party abandoned him and joined the opposition to officially impeach him, while his political nemesis - former Prime Minister Tymoshenko - was freed from captivity.The move was a clear message to Moscow that Ukraine would not be controlled by Russia and that Ukraine instead was looking toward Europe as it charted its future path.  Indeed, to the chagrin of Russia, the new interim president of Ukraine declared the country would pursue closer ties with the European Union.  The winds of change had swept across Ukraine with the ""Maidan"" or Independence Square stamped in the history books as ""Ground Zero"" of Ukraine's 2014 battleground.But the celebration in Ukraine did not last long. The battleground terrain shifted eastward at the start of March 2014 when the Russian parliament granted Russian President Putin authorization to use force in Ukraine, and Russian forces annexed the Ukrainian territory of Crimea.  Clearly, Putin and Russia felt entitled to reclaim their foothold in Ukraine, thus recalling alarming memories  for the rest of the world of the Soviet invasion of then-Czechoslovakia in 1968  to subdue the independence-minded Prague Spring.  Adding to the crisis was the perplexing decision by Russian President Putin to refuse to acknowledge that Russian troops were even in Crimea.In response to Russia's actions against Ukraine, and particularly in the direction of controlling Crimea, the G7 countries (G8 minus Russia) pulled out of preparations for the G8 summit set to take place in Russia and the United States  instituted targeted sanctions against Russian officials.Talks aimed at resolving the crisis yielded no results.  Indeed, an East-West conflict was intensifying as  Crimea scheduled a referendum  for mid-March 2014 when residents would decide whether or not to join Russia.  A meeting between Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov and United States Secretary of State Kerry  ended in failure. Because Russia viewed the overthrow of Yanukovych as illegal, and because the West viewed Crimea's decision to join Russia was in violation of international law,  an impasse was at hand.The United States  and the European Union respectively warned that such a unilateral action would run counter to international law, and thus they would not recognize the likely ratification of Crimean unification with Russia.  For its part, Ukraine insisted that it would not accept the fracturing of its territorial integrity.Meanwhile, the West attempted to condemn Crimea's secession referendum, and issue its support for Ukraine's sovereignty,  by moving forward with a resolution in the United Nations Security Council.  As expected, Russia -- as a veto-wielding permanent member -- vetoed the draft.  Every other Security Council member voted in favor of the measure, with the exception of China, which abstained from the vote.  The inaction at the Security Council was reminiscent of the Cold war era in which both sides habitually vetoed the other's measures, essentially creating a state of diplomatic paralysis.On March 16, 2014, ethnic Russians in Crimea voted overwhelmingly to secede from Ukraine and unite with Russia.  Crimea then officially requested that the ""Republic of Crimea"" be admitted as a new subject to the Russian Federation.On the Russian side of the equation, Russia recognized Crimea as a sovereign entity.  Russian President Putin soon responded by officially annexing Crimea.The United States and the European Union imposed  personal sanctions on Russian and Crimean officials.  This punitive action was intended as a rebuke against the actions in Crimea; however, there was no sign that Russia was even slightly daunted by its decision to seize control of a territory belonging to Ukraine under the established system of international jurisprudence.  As stated above, Russia justified its moves by asserting that the interim post-Yanukovych government in Ukraine was illegitimate.Russian ambitions to regain territory lost following the collapse of the Soviet Union soon entered into the equation.  Of note was the fact that in the aftermath of Russia's annexation of Crimea, Russian attention was glancing towards other parts of eastern Ukraine.  Eruptions of unrest in this Russian-speaking part of Ukraine were blamed on Russia, and reminiscent of what had transpired in Crimea.  Indeed, Ukraine was accusing Russia of carrying out its Crimea formula by  orchestrating unrest further into Ukrainian territory.It was to be seen if the landscape in eastern Europe in the spring of 2014 represented the foundation for a renewed Cold War between the East and West.  It was also possible that President Barack Obama of the United States was correct in dismissing such a notion on the basis of the fact that Russia was no longer a super power and, instead, a regional power acting as a bully against its neighbors.Note that a presidential election was held in Ukraine on May 25, 2014. Petro Poroshenko claimed victory in Ukraine's  presidential contest but turmoil continued to rock Ukraine.  Entering the fray at the start of June 2014, NATO moved to bolster its security presence in eastern Europe as a deterrent against Russian aggression.In June and July 2014, Ukrainian forces made some progress in retaking the rebel-held parts of eastern Ukraine, while the United States intensified its sanctions against Russian companies as a punitive measure against Russia for failing to de-escalate the conflict.The landscape in eastern Ukraine took a disturbing turn on July 17, 2014, when a civilian passenger aircraft traveling from Netherlands to Malaysia went down in eastern Ukraine.  All 298 people aboard the Boeing 777 airliner perished when Malaysian Airlines flight 17 crashed in the rebel-held territory of Donesk close to the Russian border. That event augured a geopolitical land mine as Ukraine said the Malaysian Airlines flight was shot down and placed the blame on pro-Russian separatists battling Ukrainian forces.  The tragedy of the Malaysian Airlines flight occurred one day after the Obama administration in the United States unveiled harsh punitive sanctions against major Russian firms aligned with Russian President Putin.In the aftermath of the tragic downing of the Malaysian Airlines flight, and because the majority of the victims with Dutch nationals, Europe's stance against Russia hardened.  Accordingly,  the West -- including the United States and the European Union --  intensified its sanctions regime against Russia.Meanwhile, in August 2014,  Ukrainian forces at first held the momentum in the fight to regain control over the pro-Russian eastern part of the country, particularly in separatist strongholds of Donetsk and Luhansk.  However, Russian-backed separatists were vigorously defending what they viewed as their own territory later in the month.  By the close of August 2014,  NATO said that Russian forces had violated Ukraine's territory while the Ukrainian president warned that his country was on the brink of war with Russia.At the start of September 2014, NATO announced a rapid reaction force as well as military exercises in eastern Europe.  Pressure from NATO and the threat of fresh sanctions by the European Union appeared to have spurred pro-Russian separatists to go to the negotiating table with Ukrainian authorities.  There, a fragile truce was soon established but sporadically violated as fighting continued in Donetsk and Luhansk, and as Ukrainian forces fought to hold the port city of Mariupol.In September 2014, with the ceasefire still in effect, Ukraine concentrated on the process of trying to retain its territorial integrity while meeting the needs of the pro-Russian separatists. To that end, Ukraine unveiled a proposal that would convey ""special status"" for eastern part of country, conveying greater autonomy.  Meanwhile, the Ukrainian parliament advanced its pro-Western orientation by ratifying the Association Agreement with European Union (the basis of the uprising that caused the ousting of Yanukovych in the first place), while Ukrainian President Poroshenko unveiled a package of reforms aimed at securing membership in the European Union.By October 2014, Russian President  Putin was calling for the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukrainian border.  However, NATO was warning that there was no sign of Russian troops actually retreating from the border in any significant fashion; as well, Russian forces remained active within Ukraine in violation of that country's sovereignty.  Ukrainian President Poroshenko viewed the strong election performance of allied pro-Western parties as a ratification of, and a mandate for, his security plans for eastern Ukraine.  However, that eastern portion of the country was moving forward with illegal elections of their own, which were rejected by Ukraine and the larger international community, but which were (unsurprisingly) being backed by Russia.By November 2014, fighting had erupted in the east, there were reports of a build up of pro-Russian reinforcements there, and it was fair to say that the fragile ceasefire that had been in place since September 2014 was on the brink of collapse.December 2014 saw a prisoner exchange occur between the Ukrainian government and pro-Russian separatists. As well, Ukrainian President Poroshenko said that he intended to meet with his Russian, French, and German counterparts in early 2015 for discussions on the restoration of peace in the eastern part of the country.  These actions were regarded as positive steps in the arena of regional relations.  However, Ukraine's decision to revoke its neutral status -- a move that could potentially facilitate future NATO membership -- was likely to raise the ire of Russia, which has opposed Ukraine's westward drift from the onset.  Ironically, it was Russia's own aggressive interventions in eastern Ukraine, particularly marked by the annexation of Crimea, that actually catalyzed Ukraine's haste to move out of Russia's orbit.At the start of 2015, the Minsk ceasefire agreement was effectively dead as fighting resumed around Donetsk and as pro-Russian separatists carried out an assault on the strategic port city of Mariupol, prompting Ukrainian President Poroshenko to warn that his forces would not bend to pro-Russian rebels and that Ukraine would protect its sovereignty.  Fighting had extended to other areas in Ukraine's east as pro-Russian separatists aggressively sought to consolidate control over what they have termed ""New Russia.""As the month of February 2015 began, there were reports that the Obama administration in the United States was considering additional support for Ukrainian forces in protecting Ukraine from the pro-Russian offensive.  As well, NATO was considering the establishment of special command units in eastern Europe to respond rapidly to threats in the region.Note that on Feb. 12, 2015, a new Minsk ceasefire agreement and a roadmap for peace were forged. But later in February 2015, peace in eastern Ukraine remained elusive as pro-Russians took control over the town of Debaltseve and forced  Ukrainian forces into retreat.  Pro-Russian forces were reportedly attacking government-held positions in eastern Ukraine -- including the area around the strategic port of Mariupol -- while Ukraine accused Russia of dispatching more troops and tanks to the region, specifically in the direction of the town of Novoazovsk on the southern coast.Meanwhile, a year after the original Maidan uprising in Kiev ousted former pro-Russian President Yanukovych from power, Ukraine's second largest city of Kharkiv was struck by a bomb attack as demonstrators marched in a national unity rally.  Despite the existence of the second Minsk ceasefire agreement, Ukraine was still occasionally mired by war and bloodshed.  Europe warned of further sanctions to come if violations to the truce occurred and, indeed, a fragile peace appeared to take hold in the region. Juxtaposed against this background came a surprising admission from Russian President Putin that he had long-standing ambitions to regain Russian control over Crimea.By mid-2015, despite the existing new Minsk ceasefire agreement, key areas of eastern Ukraine were beset by heavy fighting between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists.Tension were also rising over the findings of a  multinational investigation into the aforementioned tragedy of Malaysian Airlines Flight 17.  The inquest, led by the Dutch Safety Board,  indicated that a Russian Buk surface-to-surface missile  was fired from a village in  eastern Ukraine under pro-Russian control and struck Malaysian Air Flight 17, precipitating the crash.As such, there were ising calls for  an international tribunal to ensure justice was served.For his part, Russian President Vladimir Putin cast the move as ""premature.""Around the same period of mid-2015,  Ukraine's parliament was moving forward with constitutional reforms aimed at establishing temporary self-rule in the eastern part of the country under pro-Russian rebel rule.  The changes to the constitution were aimed at meeting Ukraine's obligations under the prevailing MInsk peace accord.While the legislative progress in Ukraine signaled to some that the government in Kiev was adhering to its Minsk peace accord commitments,  Russia objected to the changes, arguing that they did not go far enough to fulfill the obligations of the Minsk.  There were also objections at home in Ukraine by nationalists to the deal that would grant autonomy to pro-Russian rebels.  Those protests in Kiev turned deadly, effectively expanding the landscape of unrest in Ukraine.In September 2015, the schedule for local elections in the pro-Russian eastern part of Ukraine threatened to upend the Minsk peace accord.  In the same period, Ukraine was calling on NATO to provide it with military weapons; however, NATO made clear that its priority was to ensure the implementation of the Minsk peace agreement .See ""Political Conditions"" for details related to the ongoing unrest in eastern Ukraine, which has been blamed on Russia.Special EntryRussian missile fragments found at Malaysian Airline crash site in eastern Ukraine; is Russian veto of United Nations Security Council proposal for United Nations tribunal to prosecute suspects of  shoot-down disaster motivated by self-interest?Summary:In mid-July 2015, a year after Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 was shot down over an eastern Ukrainian war zone, killing close to 300 people, there was a call for justice as evidence began to mount against Russian-backed rebels.  Of particular note was a proposal for a United Nations tribunal to prosecute suspects of Malaysian Air shoot-down disaster over eastern Ukraine, as well as a legal case seeking compensation for te families of victims.  As July 2015 came to a close, Russia vetoed that proposal when it came before the United Nations Security Council, raising questions that its action was politically-motivated.  Those suspicions were raised more acutely when, in August 2015, Dutch investigators said fragments of a Russian missile system were found at the crash site, essentially implicating  Russia more directly in the shoot-down disaster, which had been generally attributed to pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine.Now,  with physical evidence of a Russian missile system being found at the scene of the crash, the Russian veto of the proposal for a United Nations tribunal to prosecute suspects stood out as an example of Russia acting in its own self-interest.In Detail:In mid-July 2015, a year after Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 was shot down over an eastern Ukrainian war zone, killing close to 300 people, there was a call for justice as evidence began to mount against Russian-backed rebels.  Of particular note was a proposal for a United Nations tribunal to prosecute suspects of Malaysian Air shoot-down disaster

system were found at the crash site, essentially implicating  Russia more directly in the shoot-down disaster, which had been generally attributed to pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine.  Now,  with physical evidence of a Russian missile system being found at the scene of the crash, the Russian veto of the proposal for a United Nations tribunal to prosecute suspects stood out as an example of Russia acting in its own self-interest.Going back to mid-2014, the landscape in eastern Ukraine was beset by crisis as Russian-backed separatists were at war with the Ukrainian forces in what was becoming a bloody and volent conflict.  The already-dire geopolitical landscape took a disturbing turn on July 17, 2014, when a civilian passenger aircraft traveling from  Amsterdam in the Netherlands to Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia went down in eastern Ukraine.  All 298 people aboard the on board the Boeing 777 airliner -- 283 passengers, including 80 children, and 15 crew members -- perished when Malaysian Airlines flight 17 crashed in the rebel-held territory of Donesk close to the Russian border.That event augured a geopolitical landmine when it was revealed that the Malaysian Airlines flight was shot down and  blame was soon placed on pro-Russian separatists battling Ukrainian forces.  Of particular significance was the mounting evidence pointing to the fact that the aircraft was struck  by a Russian-supplied missile, which was likely fired by pro-Russian rebels operating in the area.Indeed, a preliminary report released in September 2014 made  note of the fact that the damage to the Flight 17's  fuselage and cockpit indicated that it had been impacted by  high-energy objects from outside the aircraft.  This finding was consistent with the theory that Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 was hit  by a missile of some kind.  This theory was further bolstered when the Office of the Director of National Intelligence in the United States reported that there was a ""solid case"" that a SA-11 missile -- also known as the Buk surface-to-surface missile  -- was fired from eastern Ukraine and likely struck the airliner, causing it to crash and killing all those on board.  Other evidence involved voice recordings of pro-Russian rebel commanders admitting they had shot down the airliner.The tragedy soon transposed into something of a scandal when the Russian-backed rebels  prevented emergency responders from gathering the remains  of passengers, and in fact treated both the human remains and the belongings of victims with grave disrespect.  As such, in the aftermath of the tragic downing of the Malaysian Airlines flight, and because the majority of the victims with Dutch nationals, Europe's stance against Russia hardened.  Accordingly,  the West -- including the United States and the European Union --  intensified its sanctions regime against Russia.  For its part, Russia has throughout denied any responsible for the tragedy.A year later in mid-July 2015,  the Dutch Safety Board, which was leading a multinational investigation into the tragedy,  was in the process of compiling a report on the shoot-down disaster.  While the final report was not due to be released until October 2015, preliminary findings indicated the following:  1. There was ""no evidence of technical or human error"" ;  2. The flight data recorder showed that ""all engine parameters were normal for cruise flight"" until the recording ""stopped abruptly"" at the time of the crash;  3. Evidence pointed to the fact that the Russian Buk surface-to-surface missile  was fired from a village in  eastern Ukraine under pro-Russian control and struck Malaysian Air Flight 17, precipitating the crash.The report also chided Malaysian Airlines for continuing to fly over a dangerous war zone despite other countries' dispatches and warnings, known as ""notices to airmen"" or NOTAMs.As these preliminary findings began to circulate in the public sphere, Malaysia -- one of the countries involved in the multinational inquest  -- demanded that the United Nations authorize a tribunal to further probe the crash.  This call was echoed by Prime Minister Mark Rutte of the Netherlands -- the country that bore the brunt of the tragic death toll in the downing of Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 -- as he argued that  an international tribunal would be needed to ensure justice was served.  For his part, Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed this call for the establishment of such a prosecutorial United Nations tribunal, casting the move as ""premature.""  But his stance was not finding resonance across the world.Meanwhile, relatives  of the Flight 17  victims were wasting no time seeking legal recourse and financial reparations as they filed a  $900 million  lawsuit against a Russian-supported rebel leader believed to be responsible for the shoot-down disaster over the eastern Ukrainian warzone.  The legal writ filed in the United States alleged that a Russian national,  Igor Strelkov ( also known as Igor Girkin) was functioning as a rebel leader in eastern Ukraine, and was acting with the ""actual or apparent"" authority of Russian government when  Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine.  Court documents made available to Agence France Presse included the following assertion: ""Flight 17 flew over the airspace of the area in which the aforesaid rebel army was waging its war activities and the rebel army under the command responsibility of defendant Girkin shot down the subject Boeing 777-200 aircraft.""Floyd Wisner, the attorney who advanced the lawsuit on behalf of the victims' families said the legal action had  ""nothing to do with the money.""  Instead, he made clear that it was intended to pressure both the United Nations and Russia to bring those responsible to justice.  Wisner said, ""The relatives want answers, and we believe Girkin has answers. This lawsuit could shed light on the families' concerns, particularly over slow-moving diplomatic measures.""Note that as July 2015 came to a close, Russia -- a permanent and thus veto-wielding member of the United Nations Security Council -- vetoed a draft resolution calling for a United Nations tribunal to be established  to prosecute suspects of Malaysian Air shoot-down disaster over eastern Ukraine.The proposal was rewarded with 11 of the 15 members of the United Nations Security Council voting in its favor, and with Angola, Venezuela, and China abstaining from the vote.  But even that overwhelming tally was not enough to save the draft from surviving Russia's veto.Given Russia's apparent complicity in the disaster, the general consensus was that the veto was a measure of self-interest by Moscow.Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin made this point himself as he said, ""There can be no reason to oppose this [ unless you are a perpetrator yourself.""  For his part,  Russia's  Amabassador to the United Nations, Vitaly Churkin, dismissed the claim that  his country's was attempting to stymie the process of accountability.  He noted that  criminal prosecutions would have been carried out in a ""closed fashion"" and blamed  the media for ""aggressive propaganda.""Despite this defense, Russia's veto was decried internationally and  vociferously.  United States Amabassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, condemned Russia's veto of the draft proposal seeking, as she declared, ""Russia has callously disregarded the public outcry in the grieving nations.""  Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop cast the Russian veto as  ""an affront to the memory of the 298 victims of MH17 and their families and friends.""  Foreign Minister Bishop also intimated that the Russian veto was not the end of the matter. Instead, she said that her country would be joined by Malaysia, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Ukraine in seeking an alternative pathway to prosecution mechanism.By August 2015, suspicions about the Russian veto at the United Nations Security Council and Russia's eagerness to evade accountability were heightened more acutely when Dutch investigators said fragments of the Russian Buk surface-to-air missile system were found at the crash site.Fred Westerbeke, a spokesperson for the Dutch Prosecutor's Office, made clear that the fragments  were very clearly  not parts of the downed aircraft, and that examinations had shown that they were likely from a missile system.  He said, ""We are going to need more investigation to really find out what exactly this is and if it is part of a possible system that took down MH17. If we can establish that, then we can say that it is a breakthrough.""In a statement, the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) -- led by the Netherlands, but also including representatives of Ukraine, Belgium, Malaysia and Australia -- announced that  seven missile fragments had been ""secured during a previous recovery mission in eastern Ukraine.""  The JIT added that further investigation was thus in the offing, noting, ""The parts are of particular interest to the criminal investigation as they can possibly provide more information about who was involved in the crash of MH17. For that reason the JIT further investigates the origin of these parts.""It was expected that the JIT would prevail upon the expertise of weapons experts and forensic specialists to refine its examination.The  investigators stopped short of outright accusing Russia of being behind the shoot-down disaster, noting in careful terms that they had not yet proved a ""causal connection"" between Russia and the crash of Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 that killed close to  298 people on board.The discovery of  physical evidence of the  Russian missile system  essentially implicated  Russia more closely  in the shoot-down disaster, which had been generally attributed to pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine.  But in  truth, the main question going forward would be whether or not the fatal missile was fired by Russian-backed separatists, or, if the Russian military had played a more direct role in the disaster.Special EntryRussia launches military exercises at bases in Armenia and in disputed territories of Georgia --In the background of Russia's encroachment into eastern Ukraine, and its annexation of Crimea in 2014, surrounding countries have watched warily, wondering if its territories would be similarly affected.  In March 2015, Russia's Defense  Ministry confirmed that large-scale military exercises involving 2,000 Russian troops had commenced in the southern part of the country, along contested borders and even in disputed regions.The areas affected included  the federal districts of Southern and North Caucasus, as well as the recently annexed Ukrainian region of Crimea. Military drills were also taking place on Russian military bases  Armenia,  and in the Georgian separatist regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.The moves were being regarded as a symbolic illustration of Russian hegemony and influence in the region, irrespective of global outrage over Russia's backing of separatists in eastern Ukraine and the ensuing war that has rocked the region since 2014.In fact, while global attention has focused on Russia's annexation of the Ukrainian region of Crimea, Russia has been quitely working towards subsuming the semi-autonomous Georgian territory of South Ossetia into its fold.  In fact, a treaty, known as the ""Treaty of Alliance and Integration""  was drafted in December 2014 with the intent of integrating the Russian speaking enclave, irrespective of Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity or its legal claim on South Ossetia.  At the  end of January  2015, the leader of South Ossetia, Leonid Tibilov, dispatched finalized documents to Moscow. In February 2015, Russia and South Ossetia signed the ""Treaty on the State Border,"" which was being viewed as a first step towards the signing of the broader ""Treaty of Alliance and Integration.""  Once that integration accord was signed, South Ossetia would be absorbed by Russia over a period of months.A similar process has been underway as regards the other Georgian semi-autonomous breakaway region, Abkhazia, which was also home to a Russian-speaking population.  The alliance and integration measures related to Abkhazia, however, were not regarded as comprehensive as the integration accord at stake for South Ossetia.As with the annexation of Crimea, the integration of Georgian territories had no chance of gaining international recognition, and instead, Russia's territorial encroachment has been widely condemned.  Of course, the loudest outrage as regards South Ossetia and Abkhazia has come from Georgia, which already fought a war with Russia in 2008 over these very issues of control.  Nevertheless, Russian President Vladimir Putin was not expected to curtail his expansionist ambitions.Special Entry:Russia encroaches  into semi-autonomous Georgian  territories of South Ossetia and Abkhazia--  Note that some aspects of this entry are replicated from the entry above due to relevance --In the backdrop of Russia's encroachment into eastern Ukraine, and its annexation of Crimea in 2014, surrounding countries have watched warily, wondering if its territories would be similarly affected.  In March 2015, Russia's Defense  Ministry confirmed that large-scale military exercises involving 2,000 Russian troops had commenced in the southern part of the country, along contested borders and even in disputed regions.The areas affected included  the federal districts of Southern and North Caucasus, as well as the recently annexed Ukrainian region of Crimea.

As noted by Georgian Foreign Minister Tamar Beruchashvili, ""It's a cynical and provocative step by Russia ... We consider it a move aimed at annexation."" Meanwhile, leading Western countries said it was a dangerous threat to regional stability.As with the annexation of Crimea, the integration of Georgian territories had no chance of gaining international recognition, and instead, Russia's territorial encroachment has been widely condemned. Indeed, the United States and the European Union condemned the new treaty with South Ossetia.  Jen Psaki, the spokesperson for the United States Department of State said, ""The United States' position on South Ossetia and Abkhazia remains clear: these regions are integral parts of Georgia, and we continue to support Georgia's independence, its sovereignty, and its territorial integrity."" Federica Mogherini, the European Union's foreign policy head, said the treaty was  ""yet another step"" intended to undermine ""ongoing efforts to strengthen security and stability in the region.""Of course,  as noted  above, the loudest outrage as regards South Ossetia and Abkhazia has come from Georgia, which already fought a war with Russia in 2008 over these very issues of control.  Nevertheless, Russian President Vladimir Putin was not expected to curtail his expansionist ambitions.  In fact, the Russian leader was flexing his aggressive and hawkish muscles in the region as he ordered the Russian Northern Fleet  to be on a state of full combat readiness in the Arctic.  As well, Russia commenced major military exercises across northern Russia involving more than 45,000 troops, in what was a clear show of military strength intended to intimidate its neighbors.By mid-July 2015, the European Union was warning that while world attention remained on Russia's land grab in Ukraine, Russia was doing the same in the Georgian semi-autonomous regions.Of note was the fact that  Russia had installed its own border signs inside South Ossetia, as it continued its quiet absorption of the Georgian territory.As the European Union had warned, Russia was intent on redrawing the regional map, effectively expanding its territory in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, to the detriment of Georgian sovereignty.  A statement by the European Union foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, aimed to remind Russia that it was acting in violation of international law and read as follows:  ""The EU reaffirms its full support for Georgia's territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders.""Meanwhile, the political landscape in Georgia was tense due to Russia's moves in South Ossetia and Abkhazia.On July 18, 2015, thousands of demonstrators were on the streets of the Georgian capital of Tblisi to register their outrage over what Russia's so-called ""occupation"" of the two semi-autonomous regions.  In an interview with Agence France Presse, Tamara Chergoleishvili, a leading protest organizer, explained the mass action as follows: ""The Kremlin continues to use both hard and soft power in its efforts to subjugate Georgia.  We gathered here to show that Russia's aggressive policy doesn't belong to the 21st century.""Special Entry:Russia questions 1991 recognition of Baltic states' independenceIn mid-2015,  Russia was questioning the recognition of  the independence of the Baltic nation states of Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia.The office of Russia's chief prosecutor announced plans to examine the legitimacy of the former Soviet Union's recognition of the three Baltic countries in 1991, and to specifically consider whether the action was legal.  The action was spurred by letters by two members of parliament, who alleged that the decision to recognize the independence of Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia has been taken  ""by an unconstitutional body.""Not surprisingly, the governments of the Baltic countries  reacted with outrage.  Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite reacted by declaring: ""Our independence was gained through the blood and sacrifice of the Lithuanian people. No one has the right to threaten it.""  Her country's  Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius characterized the  investigation  as ""a provocation to say the least""  and also  an ""absurd provocation.""  In an interview with Reuters News, Estonian Foreign Minister Keit Pentus-Rosimannus offered a similar assessment.  Pentus-Rosimannus said, ""The entire issue is legally absurd. It serves as yet another example of the resurgent imperialistic mood that unfortunately exists in Russia.""That sense of concern over Russia's imperial aspirations was real,  given that country's recent actions in eastern Ukraine, and in particular, the annexation of Crimea in 2014.  Faced with international condemnation for its annexation of the Ukrainian territory, Russia's  chief prosecutor  justified the move by declaring that Crimea was illegally transferred  from Russia to Ukraine in 1954.  Now, there were fears that Russia was using the same type of justification in regard to the Baltic countries, which were underSoviet control from 1940 until the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991.  Indeed, this suggestion by Russia that Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia may have been granted independent recognition illegally  was raising the alarm that Russia was now looking to return the Baltic nation states to its fold, as part of Russian Vladimir Putin's recent penchant to reconstitute the Soviet Union.While Russia has sought to quiet these concerns,  with the Kremlin casting the investigation as simply a formality with no legal consequences, there remained prevailing anxieties about these moves, even if they proved to be perfunctory.  The fact of the matter was that if Russia did, in fact, seek to re-absorb the three Baltic countries, there would be consequences in terms of global security.  With Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia being NATO member states, an attack on their sovereignty would spur a defensive response by NATO.Special NoteRussian engagement in Syrian CrisisSince early 2011, anti-government protests have spread and escalated across the Arab world; Syria emerged as an addition to the list of countries experiencing unrest in March 2011. At first, protesters stopped short of demanding the resignation of President Bashar al-Assad, instead demanding greater political freedom and efforts to end corruption. For his part, President Assad announced he would advance a reform agenda, which would include lifting the emergency laws that had been in place for decades, and increased rights to the country's disenfranchised Kurdish population. These moves were aimed at quelling the rising climate of unrest gripping the country. But over time, as protests continued, and as the Assad regime carried out a hardline crackdown on dissent, tensions escalated between the government and the protesters.In mid-2011, the United Nations Security Council and the Arab League respectively issued condemnations of the violence in Syria. As well, the United Nations Human Rights Council called for an independent inquiry into the violent crackdown on dissent. Meanwhile, global leaders were calling for President Assad to step down from power, given the brutality of the Syrian regime's crackdown on protesters.  In 2012, the bloody crackdown by the Assad regime on anti-government protesters was ongoing. In fact, the crackdown appeared to become more relentless in places such as Homs and Aleppo. Despite widespread condemnation from the West, a United Nations Security Resolution on the situation in Syria was subject to veto by Russia and China. A subsequent vote in the United Nations General Assembly overwhelmingly condemned Syria for its brutal crackdown. A prevailing truce, brokered by the joint United Nations/Arab League envoy, Kofi Annan, was established in the interests of preventing further bloodshed; however, it was revealed to be an exercise in theory rather than practice and eventually the United Nations monitoring mission ended in failure.Syria has meanwhile been subject to sanctions by various countries and was sliding into pariah status in the international community. Assassinations, alleged  massacres, geopolitical tensions with Turkey and Israel,  and  suspicions about the use of chemical weapons, have since mired the Syrian landscape.  Indeed,  with it was increasingly clear that with President Bashar al-Assad using brutal tactics to quell the uprising  served only to create an even more tumultuous landscape, and eventually set the path for a full-blown civil war.That civil war pitted the Assad forces, backed by Lebanon-based Hezbollah, against  a disparate cabal of anti-government entities, ranging from the rebel Free Syrian Army to several Islamist terrorist enclaves.At the same time, Syria  was facing a devastating humanitarian crisis.  That crisis reached new heights in August 2013 with claims that Syrian forces launched a chemical attack on the outskirts of Damascus.  Although this was the clear sign that United States President Barack Obama's ""red line"" had definitively been crossed, the international community remained reticent about becoming more involved in the Syrian crisis. Ultimately, an  ensuing chemical weapons deal with Syria between the United States and Russia quieted the war drums.In the meantime, though, a  highly anticipated  peace summit in Geneva ended without yielding any productive results and the civil war in Syria raged on and on.By mid-2014, while Syria had shown progress in its disposal of chemical toxins, in keeping with an international agreement intended to avoid intervention by the West, the country was dealing with an ascendant ""Islamic State.""  Previously known as Islamic State of Iraq and Syria or ISIS as well as Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant or ISIL, this group self-declared a caliphate extending from Syria to Iraq.It was apparent that the power vacuum from the Syrian civil war provided a breeding ground for extremism that Islamic State could exploit and use to both challenge the Assad regime and function as a recruitment tool for Jihadists.  Whereas the West and regional powers in the Middle East had earlier called for an end to the Assad regime, suddenly the geopolitical stakes were quite different as extremist terrorists were now posing the most dangerous threat to regional stability.The barbaric beheadings of two American journalists by Islamic State in their stronghold in Syria changed the calculus and the Obama administration in the United States -- initially reticent about re-engaging in the Middle East -- was now looking at a targeted anti-terrorism strategy in the Syrian-Iraqi landscape of Islamic State.  As such, a Western coalition, led by the United States, was soon carrying out air strikes on Islamic State targets in Syria and Iraq.  Of note was the fact that the United States-led coalition expanded to include Japan and Jordan when citizens of their countries that were being held by Islamic State were also brutally killed.As of 2015, Syria was beset by two sets of intersecting challenges -- the ongoing civil war between the Assad regime and rebel forces on one end, and the horrific dangers posed by the notorious terror group, Islamic State, which had seized wide swaths of territory in Syria and left an appalling death toll.  It was generally understood that the civil war conditions in Syria, to some extent, facilitated the emergence of Islamic State in  that country.  Syrian President Assad's priority to hold onto power, and thus the center of power in Damascus, had allowed a power chasm to flourish in other parts of the country, which Islamic State has been able to exploit.  The result has been a mass exodus of Syrians fleeing the country and seeking refuge in Europe.  The so-called migrant influx in  Europe has raised questions as to how to legally and humanely deal with a burgeoning humanitarian refugee crisis.At the political level, Russia signaled it would be entering the Syrian crisis militarily in September 2015 although it was unclear if Moscow's goal was to  bolster and preserve Bashar al-Assad's hold on power, or, to go after Islamic State.  The geopolitical landscape was complicated in October 2015 with the news that the United States would be deploying special operations teams to Syria.  The scene in November 2015 was grave as Russia and France intensified their efforts to go after Islamic State targets in Syria following devastating terror attacks by the Islamist terror network that killed hundreds of Russian and French citizens.Russia, France, and the United States were now respectively changing their respective calculations, cognizant that the Islamist terror group was no longer simply seeking to build its Caliphate but, instead, transposing its goals to more of an Islamic Jihadist orientation.  The result was a global security crisis.Update on Syrian Civil War and threat posed by Islamic State--In the autumn of 2015, the geopolitical  dynamics of the region were complicated by the news that Russian military forces were operating in Syria to help shore up the Assad regime. Reports were emerging about no shortage of Russian fighter jets in Syria, as well as infantry forces, battle tanks and other military Russian military resources  at an airfield near the Syrian city of Latakia.  As well,  Russia deployed military advisers to Syria and staged naval exercises off Syria.Also of note was the fact that a global coalition, led by the United States, was already carrying out air strikes against Islamic State targets in Iraq and Syria.  With both Russia and the United States-led Western coalition likely to be carrying out air strikes on Islamic State targets in the same region, the two countries were discussing modes of cooperation and coordination that would prevent accidents in their respective air campaigns.To this end, regardless of their frosty bilateral relations, Russian President Vladimir Putin and United States President Barack Obama met on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly meeting to discuss this matter.Russian President Putin characterized that meeting as follows:  ""Our talks were very constructive, business-like and surprisingly frank.""  A Russia aide to the president added to Putin's assessment of the meeting with Obama and their intent to work cooperatively as he said:  ""We have clarity on their objectives. Their objectives are to go after ISIL and to support the government.""Both leaders expressed the importance of  avoiding air collisions between their respective air strike fleets; however, their visions for Syria's future remained quite different.  While Putin has argued that Syria's stability and anti-terrorism efforts can only be maintained by keeping the Assad regime in power.  Obama, by contrast, has cast Assad as a tyrant who was responsible for no shortage of gross abuses against his own people, and whose record should not be sanitized in the effort to go after Islamic State.  For President Obama, there was a need for ""a new [Syrian] leader and an inclusive government that united the Syrian people in the fight against terrorist groups.""Nevertheless, with Islamic State continuing to pose one of the most pressing threats to global security,  President Obama expressed a pragmatic stance suggesting that there might be a  ""managed transition"" from Assad's rule.  This policy appeared to be backed by other Western leaders, namely United Kingdom Prime Minister David Cameron. Of concern was the reality that the loss of Assad at the helm might produce a power chasm that Islamic State and other unsavory actors could exploit.To this end, President Obama said, ""There is no room for accommodating an apocalyptic cult like ISIL and the United States makes no apology for using our military as part of a broad coalition to go after it."" He added, ""Realism dictates that compromise will be required to end the fighting and ultimately stamp out ISIL. But realism also requires a managed transition away from Assad and to a new leader and an inclusive government that recognizes there must be an end to this chaos.""  President Obama also noted that his country was willing to work with other partner nation states in the effort to vanquish Islamic State and ultimately stabilize Syria.  To this end, he said, ""The United States is prepared to work with any nation, including Russia and Iran, to resolve the conflict. But we must recognize that there cannot be, after so much bloodshed, so much carnage, a return to the pre-war status quo.""United States Secretary of State John Kerry and his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, further elaborated their two countries' respective interests in Syria by noting that they had agreed on  ""some fundamental principles.""  In an interview with MSNBC News, Kerry explained, ""There was agreement that Syria should be a unified country, united, that it needs to be secular, that ISIL needs to be taken on, and that there needs to be a managed transition.""  Kerry also added that with the Syrian crisis raging on, and with the human  toll increasing alarmingly, there was a need for cooperation .  He said, ""Everybody understands that Syria is at stake, and the world is looking rapidly for some kind of resolution.""It should be noted that the  Syrian National Coalition -- Syria's political opposition in exile -- has made it clear that it rejects any role for Assad in a transitional government.  That unrelenting stance was sure to complicate any joint effort by Russia and the West to facilitate a ""managed transitions of power"" in Syria.Meanwhile, there remained some questions about the actual goals and purpose of Russia's military intervention into Syria.  Was it actually aimed at assisting the global effort against the world's most notorious and brutal terror group, Islamic State?  Or was it actually more craven and aimed at ensuring that Russian President Vladimir Putin's ally, Bashar al-Assad, could hold onto power?  To that latter end, in late September 2015, United States officials reported  to the news outlet, CNN, that Russian fighter jets had  turned off their transponders to evade detection as they flew into Syrian territory.  United States officials also confirmed that Russian  drones were flying in the area of the  city of Latakia.Since this was not exactly Islamic State territory, the conclusion was that Russia was more focused on supporting Assad's regime than actually fighting terrorism.  Separately, other Western countries were reaching the same conclusion.  As noted by French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, ""You have to look at who is doing what. The international community is striking Daesh [IS]. France is striking Daesh. The Russians, for the time being, are not at all.""It should be noted that, the prospect of Russia intervening into Syria to shore up President Assad was not being well-received by Gulf Arab countries, who argued that such a move would only deepen the conflict.Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir characterized the Russian intervention as an ""escalation"" and emphasized his country's view that a stable Syria in the future would not involve Assad at the helm of power.  For Russia, though,  which was an ally of Assad-led Syria, and which had a naval base at Tartous in Syria, supporting the Assad regime would also preserve a level of Russian influence in the region.Note that on Sept. 30, 2015 -- shortly after agreeing to work with the United States to go after Islamic State -- Russian fighter jets were carrying out strikes on the anti-Assad  rebel strongholds of Homs and Hama.  The United States was informed of the Russian strikes only one hour before they commenced.  For its part, Russia claimed that it was also carrying out missions against Islamic State Islamic State military equipment, ammunition, communications, and fuel supply targets, however, United States officials noted this did not appear to be the case.  The Russians' actual  choices of air strike targets in Homs and Hama, along with United States assessments, made clear that the Russian intervention into Syria was clearly for the purpose of bolstering the Assad regime.That being said, later air strikes  reported by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights at the start of October 2015  indicated that Russia was also targeting command posts in the Islamic State de facto capital of Raqqa.  That effort appeared to be forcing residents there to cancel prayers.For its part, the United States reacted to this news by making clear that it would remained focused on the goal of vanquishing Islamic Sate.United States department of state spokesperson, John Kirby, said:  ""The U.S.-led coalition will continue to fly missions over Iraq and Syria as planned and in support of our international mission to degrade and destroy ISIL.""By the start of October 2015 -- shortly after the start of  Russia's foray into Syria --  a geopolitical imbroglio was sparked when Russian fighter jets twice violated Turkish air space.Russia explained one such violation as a mistake due to weather conditions; however, Turkey was not receptive to that explanation, with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan issuing the following warning: ""If Russia loses a friend like Turkey, with whom it has been cooperating on many issues, it will lose a lot, and it should know that"" He added that ""an attack on Turkey means an attack on NATO.""  For its part,  NATO -- of which Turkey was a member state -- also refused to accept that explantation, noting that the Russian incursions ""did not look like an accident"" and with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg noting that the Russian violations of Turkish air space ""lasted for a long time.""  Stoltenberg further cast the Russian incursions as ""unacceptable,"" and warned that the North Atlantic security bloc was viewing the situation ""very seriously.""It should be noted that bilateral ties between Turkey and Syria have been a downward spiral largely due to Turkey's criticism of the Assad regime's brutal crackdown on anti-government factions. The ties between the two countries reached a new low in mid-2012 when Syrian air defenses shot down a Turkish fighter jet, but deteriorated further in October 2012 when Syrian mortar fire killed five Turkish civilians in a border town.  The Turkish parliament at the time authorized military action against Syria  in the aftermath of that incident.  The geopolitical scene grew  more complicated  later in 2012 when Turkish jets forced a Syrian plane, which was suspected of ""non-civilian cargo,"" to land in Turkey. Authorities in that country said that the move was aimed at preventing the passage of weapons through its airspace into Syria. The geopolitical complexity was exacerbated when Russia and Syria decried the move by Turkey.  In late 2012, it was announced that the  United States would send 400 troops and two Patriot air defense missile batteries to Turkey to help defend its NATO ally against possible threats from Syria.  Tensions between Turkey and Syria emerged again in March 2014 when Turkey downed a Syria aircraft, which (according to Turkey) had violated its air space.  In 2015, as discussed here, with the entry of Russian forces into the Syrian crisis, so too came violations of Turkish air space by Russian jets  operating in Syria.In many senses, Turkey was becoming a key inflection point in the ongoing Syrian crisis.Meanwhile, Russia reported that it carried out repeated air strikes on Islamic State targets in the first week of October 2015.  But as before, the lion's share of Russia's activity in Syria appeared aimed at helping the Assad regime hold its territory and go after opposition rebel groups, with an eye on regaining territory.  Of note were Russian continued strikes in anti-Assad rebel strongholds.  Around the same period in October 2015, Syrian forces were reported to be preparing for a ground offensive, which would presumably be backed Russian air strikes and cruise missile strikes from their fleet in the Caspian Sea.The success of the Russian effort was very much a subject of debate, despite claims of Russia being an emerging actor in the region.  For all its air strikes in Syrian territory, reports from the ground indicated that Russian strikes were more successful at hitting moderate rebel and civilian targets than Islamic State targets.In the background of these developments were continued overtures between Russia and the United States aimed at establishing rules of engagement and protocols of conduct related to their respective campaigns in Syria.  However, the United States Defense Secretary Ash Carter ruled out further cooperation with Russia regarding the Syrian crisis as he declared the Russian strategy to be clearly aimed at bolstering the Assad regime.  He said, ""We believe Russia has the wrong strategy. They continue to hit targets that are not ISIL. This is a fundamental mistake.""Nevertheless, as October 2015 came to a close, United States and Russian military officials signed a memorandum of understanding covering ""de-conflicting"" procedures and protocols to be undertaken by  their pilots in order to avoid an accidental incidences over Syria as they respectively carry out air strikes in the same territory.  A Pentagon spokesperson, Peter Cook, said that the two countries would ""form a working group to discuss any implementation issues that follow""  but that the actual agreement covered all coalition members, such as Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.The State Department was clear in noting that the agreement was geared towards keeping pilots safe and did not extend into the realm of strategic cooperation.  As noted by State Department spokesperson,  John Kirby,  ""It's not a treaty of cooperation or anything like that ... It doesn't connote cooperation or coordination or joint targeting.""In the same period of late October 2015, United States President Barack Obama indicated a policy shift regarding Syria, as it was reported that dozens of special operations troops would be deployed to northern Syria to advise opposition groups as they battle Islamic State.  The deployment indicated a departure from President Obama's ""no combat boots on the ground"" in Syria stance, although the White House insisted that the mission would have a circumscribed  and highly limited ""train, advise, and assist"" role.In the first week of November 2015, despite the addition of the Russian campaign in Syria to support Assad,  anti-government rebels were able to capture control over the town of Morek to the north of the flashpoint city of Hama.In the same period, rebels in  Idlib province recaptured  Tal Skik,  which had gone  under Hezbollah-backed Syrian control a month earlier.  These gains for anti-Assad factions indicated that despite Russia's intervention into the Syrian civil war, rebel factions continued to make their presence known.Meanwhile, ahead of scheduled multilateral talks on Syria, Russia released a blueprint for the country's future.  That initiative called for the Assad regime and the opposition to find consensus in a constitutional reform process that would last 18 months and be followed by a presidential election.Significantly, the proposal would not prevent Bashar al-Assad from contesting the presidential contest.This latter element promised to be a deal-breaker of sorts for the opposition.  As noted by Monzer Akbik of the Western-backed Syrian National Coalition, ""The Syrian people have never accepted the dictatorship of Assad and they will not accept that it is reintroduced or reformulated in another way.""  Meanwhile,  Western powers, several Sunni Arab countries in the region, and Turkey were not expected to accept a plan that included a pathway for Assad to hold onto power in Syria.  Indeed,  those various players made clear that they would not sign onto a plan that did not include an exit strategy for Assad, whom they viewed as one of the main sources of Syria's crisis.  That being said, there were other viable aspects of the proposal, such as a process for distinguishing rebel groups with terror ties and legitimate opposition entities -- the latter of which could become key players in a future peace and reconciliation plan.  As well, there were provisions for  a soft partitioning of power and security into Assad-led zones and non-Assad led zones across Syria.In the same period,  the effort against Islamic State was ongoing.  Indeed, on Nov. 12, 2015, the United States Pentagon reported that it had targeted to notorious Islamic State terrorist known as ""Jihadi John"" in an apparent drone strike in Syria.  The Kuwaiti-born British national had already been identified as Mohammed Emwazi; he  gained notoriety as the ominous masked figure  in Islamic State propaganda videos who carried out beheadings of international journalists and humanitarian workers.In this period, the United States' air strike effort was aggressively geared towards hitting Islamic State's oil producing resources, which essentially funds the terror group.In mid-November 2015, the situation was grave as Russia and France intensified their efforts to go after Islamic State targets in Syria following devastating terror attacks by the Islamist terror network that killed hundreds of Russian and French citizens.  At issue was the fact that Islamic State was claiming responsibility for a bomb that exploded on a Russian jet flying from the Egyptian resort of Sharm-el-Sheikh, killing more than 200 Russians on board.Also at issue was the Islamic State claim of responsibility for a spate of appalling terror attacks in the French capital city of Paris, which killed approximately 130 people.  Islamic State made clear that its brutal acts were being carried out because of the international community's engagement in Syria.  Islamic State also promised that attacks were to come in the United States and other Western countries.In response to what could only be understood as acts of war by Islamic State, Russian and French warplanes wasted no time before stepping up their respective air campaigns in Syria,  targeting Islamic State targets in the terror group's stronghold of Raqqa in a sustained manner.France also deployed its air craft carrier, the Charles de Gaulle, to the Middle Eastern region for the purpose of supporting the effort against Islamic State.  Of note was the fact that France was not limiting its air strike campaign from the Charles de Gaulle only to Islamic State targets in Syria, such as the terror group stronghold of Raqqa; indeed, France soon expanded its scope to hit Islamic State targets in Ramadi and Mosul in Iraq.

Overall, Russia, France, and the United States were now respectively changing their calculations, cognizant that the Islamist terror group was no longer simply seeking to build its Caliphate but, instead, transposing its goals to more of an Islamic Jihadist orientation.  The result was an international security crisis.                                                         

In addition to the killing of Russian and French nationals in the autumn of 2015,in the same period, Islamic State had also claimed responsibility  for  double bombings in  a Shi'a district of the Lebanese city of Beirut, killing more than 40 people.It was a  terrorist trifecta for Islamic State, presumably part of its effort to demonstrate its relevance and resilience even as it was being subject to strikes from various international actors.Indeed, the terror enclave was under pressure from a United States-led international coalition, as well as a bombing campaign by Russia.  Earlier in November 2015 Islamic State lost control of Sinjar in Iraq as a result of a fierce offensive by Kurdish peshmerga fighters backed by United States air power.  In the same period,  as discussed above, the United States Pentagon  reported that it had targeted the ""face"" of Islamic State in a drone strike -- the notorious terrorist ""Jihadi John"" who was shown in barbaric videotaped footage with international hostages who were executed via decapitation. The Pentagon indicated that the drone  strike was very likely successful, thus inflicting a symbolic blow against the terror group.Meanwhile, Islamic State was losing control in Aleppo in Syria.While these losses were recent, the downward trajectory for Islamic State had been occurring for several months.  As such, the terror enclave's evolving imperative might  be to show that it still had power and influence.No longer able to expand its territorial advances, Islamic State was very likely transforming its efforts.  Rather than concentrating on building and expanding its so-called Caliphate, Islamic State could be refocusing its ambitions in the direction of international Jihadism.Should this working theory gain support , it would suggest an acute threat to global security.The geopolitical complexity of Syrian civil war grew more complicated in the last week of November 2015 when Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet on the basis of accusations that the Russian aircraft violated Turkish air space.Russia disputed that claim, insisting that the jet was operating in Syrian air space as part of the fight against Islamic State.  Russia also referred to the tragic incident as a betrayal and instituted sanctions against Turkey as a result.Special Note:Russia acknowledges that bomb brought down  jet carrying vacationers from Egyptian resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh; promises retribution against Islamic StateSummaryThe crash of a Russian airliner  in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula resulted in the deaths of  all 224 persons on board.  The Russian Metrojet Flight KG9268 departed the Red Sea resort city of Sharm-el-Shekh and was bound for the Russian city of St. Petersburg but crashed before the tourists and flight crew could arrive at  their destination.  The notorious terror group, Islamic State, claimed responsibility for the downing of the flight butEgyptian officials dismissed the claim on the basis of their belief that the terror group did not have the capability to bring down a jet.  The Russian government was,  likewise,  reticent to accept terrorism as  explanation. Nevertheless, both the United States and the United Kingdom made clear that intelligence pointed to a bomb being planted on the aircraft and exploding shortly after taking off from Sharm-el-Sheikh.With an affiliate of Islamic State active in the Egyptian Sinai in recent years, and with intelligence pointing in the direction of terrorism,  that group's claim of responsibility was being viewed by the countries of the West as credible.Russia joined that group's conclusions two weeks after the crash, pointing to explosive material found on crash debris, while Russian President Vladimir Putin promised that those responsible would face justice. The international dimension of the tragedy catapulted the global security threat posed by Islamic State to new heights.In DetailOn Oct. 31, 2015, a Russian airliner carrying 224 people crashed in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula about 20 minutes after taking off from the Egyptian resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh, killing all the persons on board.  While most of those aboard were Russian citizens, there were also four Ukrainians and one Belarussian national among the victims.The Russian Metrojet Flight KG9268 departed the Red Sea city and was bound for the Russian city of St. Petersburg but crashed before the tourists and flight crew could arrive at  their destination.It was the deadliest crash of the French-made Airbus A321 airliner in recent times.According to the Egyptian authorities, the aircraft  disappeared from radar approximately 20  minutes after its departure from Sharm el-Sheikh  while flying over the central Sinai Peninsula  at an altitude of 31,000 feet.  The  Egyptian military aircraft later located the wreckage of the aircraft  in an area of the Sinai called  Hasna, just south of the Mediterranean coastal town of el-Arish.  Russian officials confirmed that the aircraft split into two in mid-air but refrained from immediately drawing conclusions about the cause of the disaster.With both of the aircraft's flight recorders, known as ""black boxes,"" recovered,  along with no shortage of forensic evidence, there would be a good foundation for investigators to determine what happened to Metrojet Flight KG9268.To that end, Egypt would be leading the investigation, which would involve the participation of an international group of aviation experts.  The Russians were expected to  assist with the inquiry given the fact that its citizens made up the vast majority of the appalling death toll.  Because the aircraft was a French-made Airbus A321, France would also be involved in the investigation into what went wrong.As well, an Irish delegation would be part of the investigation since the actual aircraft was registered  in Ireland.Although Egyptian officials initially indicated that there was nothing irregular about the doomed flight and suggested either human error or  a mechanical malfunction, Islamist terrorists in the Sinai aligned with the notorious terror group, Islamic State, claimed responsibility for  downing the flight via a  Telegram messaging application.Egyptian Prime Minister Sharif Ismail immediately dismissed the claim, asserting that the terror group did not have the capability to  bring down an aircraft from the type of high altitude Metrojet Flight KG9268 reached at the time it disappeared from radar.But in the days after the crash, authorities in the United States and United Kingdom respectively indicated that intelligence pointed to the likelihood that Metrojet Flight KG9268 was brought down by a bomb.  Clearly, this assertion by two Western countries would vitiate the notion that an Islamic State affiliate in the Sinai used some sort of missile to target the aircraft. Instead, attention was  settling on a more conventional methodology for the conduct of terrorism -- the use of a bomb, which was likely planted on the aircraft by an airport insider, and which was very likely  programmed to explode when that aircraft reached a certain altitude.United Kingdom  Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond did not prevaricate in any way as he made the following declaration: ""We have concluded that there is a significant possibility that the crash was caused by an explosive device on board the aircraft.""  Moreover, the government of the United Kingdom moved to suspend all flights to and from Sharm-el-Sheikh, while putting plans into place for providing transportation to bring British nationals home from Egypt, but only after new and stringent security protocols had been put into place. The office of United Kingdom Prime Minister David Cameron explained the government's decision with the following statement: ""The evidence we received suggested there was a credible threat with regard to Sharm al-Sheikh airport which is why we have taken the actions we have.""  The prime minister's office stopped short of providing information about what types of security actions would be taken.Across the Atlantic, unnamed officials in the United States revealed to various news agencies that  a bomb "" was a highly possible scenario"" and that terrorism was the likely cause of the crash.  Subsequently, United States President Barack Obama himself noted that there was a possibility that the Russian airliner was brought down by a bomb that was planted on board.  To that end, President Obama said, ""We're taking that very seriously.""  President Obama's head of homeland security, Jey Johnson,  later noted that new  and more stringent security measures would be implemented at certain airports across the world for aircraft flying into the United States.Of note was the fact that no United States-registered airlines fly in and out of the  Sharm al-Sheikh airport due to enduring concerns about poor security.  As such, the United States Transportation Security Administration has not  been at that airport in recent times to actually evaluate security there.Perhaps eager to protect its vital tourism industry, Egypt again dismissed the idea that islamic State terrorists within its own borders might be responsible for the tragedy.  Indeed, the Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Sisi went so far as to disparage Islamic State's claim of responsibility as mere ""propaganda.""  But on Nov. 4, 2015, another claim of responsibility had been advanced by Islamic State in the Sinai -- this time via an audio message posted on Twitter. In that message, the speaker said: ""We, with God's grace, are the ones who brought it down, and we are not obliged to disclose the mechanism of its demise.""Meanwhile, Russia was likewise distancing itself from the Islamic State and terrorism angle.  With Russia now actively participating in the civil war in Syria against both anti-Assad rebels and Islamic State, it was not keen to admit that it might be suffering so quickly from what is generally known as ""blowback"" from its Syrian engagement.  Still, the truth of the matter was that if the cause of the crash was ultimately determined to be terrorism at the hands of Islamic State, Russia would have to confront the reality that its heavy military footprint in Syria quite possibly was yielding deleterious consequences.  Of note was the fact that airplanes from various European countries depart to and from Sharm-el-Sheikh daily, yet of all the aircraft available, it was a Russian jetliner which may have been selected by Islamic State terrorists as a target.Regardless of its hesitation in accepting the terrorism explanation for the crash of Metrojet Flight KG9268, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered all flights to and from Egypt to be halted.Putin made that decision after a meeting with Alexander Bortnikov, the head of Russia's  security service, in which he recommended that Russia suspend  passenger flights to Egypt until the precise cause of the crash was determined.  Bortnikov explained the move saying, ""Until we know the real reasons for what happened, I consider it expedient to stop Russian flights to Egypt. Above all, this concerns tourist routes.""  Arrangements were also made to repatriate Russians stranded at the Egyptian resort town.Several other airlines were also taking precautions by  grounding flights scheduled to traverse that route, rerouting aircraft flying over the Sinai, while several Western governments released travel warnings expressly stating that their citizens should not travel to the Egyptian Sinai.Note that as the first week of November 2015 came to a close, authorities in the United States and United Kingdom made clear that their intelligence assets had intercepted communications, known in intelligence circles as ""chatter,"" from suspected terrorists.  This revelation only bolstered their view that Russian Metrojet Flight KG9268 was the target of terrorism.While this view would yet have to be proved via forensic evidence and a thorough assessment of information on the flight recorders, the  working theory at this time was that a bomb had been hidden in luggage and stowed in the hold of the aircraft.  The general belief was that the bomb was quite likely planted by an insider working at the Sharm-el-Sheikh airport.  That insider was believed to have worked in some form or fashion with Islamic State in the Sinai.In the second week of November 2015, Russia and Egypt continued to officially resist the terrorism explanation for the crash of the Russian Metrojet airliner in the Egyptian Sinai.  For Russia, there was no willingness to publicly admit that it was suffering from blowback as a result of its military engagement in Syria.  For Egypt, there was no desire to taint its tourism industry by admitting that the resort city of Sharm-el-Sheikh may have suffered from lax security; Egypt was also not eager to confront the reality that despite its hardline measures against Islamist militants, a likely act of international terrorism  had quite possibly occurred on its soil.  As such, Russia and Egypt continued to publicly insist that it was too soon to draw conclusions about what happened on Oct. 31, 2015.In the same period (the second week of November 2015), Islamic State -- which had already claimed responsibility for bringing down the Russian jet -- was now promising further attacks on Russia.To this end,  Islamic State was vowing via a videotaped threat to attack Russians ""very soon"" on Russian soil for that country's heavy involvement in the Syrian crisis.On Nov. 17, 2015, after two weeks of avoiding the terrorism explanation for the downing of the Metrojet flight, Russian authorities finally acknowledged that ""an act of terror"" in the form of a bomb brought down the plane over the Egyptian Sinai.Russian authorities reportedly informed President Putin that ""traces of foreign explosives"" were identified  on the debris from the aircraft. Publicly, the head of Russia's  security service, Alexander Bortnikov, said, ""We can unequivocally say it was a terrorist act.""It should be noted that the government of Egypt continued to insist that it would not arrive at premature conclusions and would let the the investigatory process be fully completed.  Egyptian Prime Minister Sherif Ismail said, ""The Egyptian authorities affirm they will take into consideration the investigations that the Russian side reached ... in the comprehensive investigation.""  Egyptian  Interior Minister Magid Abdel Ghaffar went slightly further, noting that there would be consequences if the investigation indicated security lapses at the Sharm el-Sheikh airport.  He said, ""Regarding Sharm al-Sheikh airport, when we discover that there have been security lapses action will be taken, but up to now we have no information about lapses in the search and security procedures.""  Egypt's Civil Aviation Minister Hosam Kamel, however, would not even concede that anything nefarious had occurred, as he said,  ""Up until this moment, there is no evidence of crime.""Note that on Nov. 18, 2015, Islamic State released details regarding their claim of responsibility in the Russian Metrojet disaster.  In the terror group's Dabiq  magazine, Islamic State explained that its operatives used its liquids bomb manufacturing capability, hidden in a  canned Schweppes soft drink, to bring down the doomed jetliner.  That liquids bomb making capability has been known to global anti-terrorism experts since 2006 following an investigation by MI6 experts from the United Kingdom, which has led to regulations on carry-on liquids belonging to aircraft passengers.In this message from Islamic State, the terror group said,  ""The divided Crusaders of the East and West thought themselves safe in their jets as they cowardly bombarded the Muslims of the Caliphate. And so revenge was exacted upon those who felt safe in the cockpits.""Russia's Official ResponseWith Islamic State claiming responsibility for the fatal crash, Russian President Vladmir Putin promised to ""find and punish"" those responsible for the attack over the Sinai peninsula.  He said, ""We'll look for them everywhere, wherever they are hiding. We'll find them in any corner of the planet and punish them.""  The Russian leader warned that those who carried out the attack that led to the deaths of more than 200 Russians, or were in anyway complicit in helping them,  would face justice as he declared, ""We must do this without any statute of limitations and we must find out all their names. Anyone who tries to help the criminals should know that the consequences for trying to shelter them will lie completely on their shoulders.""President Putin also made it clear that his country's military engagement in Syria would not only continue, but that Russian air strikes ""must be intensified so that the criminals understand that retribution is inevitable.""To that end, Russian warplanes wasted no time before stepping up its air campaign in Syria. The Russian government was also signaling its interest in working with France, which was also struck with a spate of terrorist attacks at the hands of Islamic State in the French capital of Paris.  Indeed, both countries were reported to be carrying out sustained air strikes on Islamic State targets in Syria.  As well, despite strained relations with the United States,  as a result of their shared interest in defeating Islamic State,  Russian and United States forces were said to be more closely coordinating their respective strikes on Islamic State targets in Syria.Special EntryTies between  Turkey and Russia erode after Russian-Turkish  jet shoot down crisisIn the last week of November 2015, the geopolitical complexity of Syrian civil war grew more complicated when Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet on the basis of accusations that the Russian aircraft violated Turkish air space.When the crew ejected from the doomed aircraft, one pilot was shot to death by extremists on the ground in Syria  as he parachuted to the ground.  There was another fatality as a  Russian special operations officer dispatched to rescue the crew was also  killed by extremists on the ground.  Only the pilot of the doomed jet survived the ordeal.According to Turkish authorities, the Russian aircraft was notified  multiple times of its territorial violation before it was shot down.  In an attempt to bolster its account of the tragic events, Turkey released an apparent audio recording of its warnings to the Russian  jet before it was shot down.On the recording,  the following warning was stated:  ""Change your heading.""Turkey also explained that its protocols in cases of territorial encroachment had been followed and its personnel attempted to  rescue the Russian pilots.For his part, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan issues no apology for the downing of the Russian jet.  Instead, Erdogan declared that his country was defending its own security and sovereignty.Russia disputed Turkey's claim, insisting that the jet was operating in Syrian air space as part of the fight against Islamic State.  Russian President Vladimir Putin referred to the tragic incident as a betrayal administered by ""the accomplices of terrorists,"" and  warned that Moscow's relations with Ankara would suffer as a result.  He said, ""Today's loss is linked to a stab in the back delivered to us by accomplices of terrorists. I cannot qualify what happened today as anything else.""He added, ""We will of course analyze everything that happened and today's tragic events will have serious consequences for Russo-Turkish relations.""Soon thereafter, the Russian government  instituted sanctions against Turkey.  Russia also remained defiant, making clear it would continue its effort in the Syrian crisis and against Islamic State. A spokesperson from the Russian Kremlin, Dmitry Peskov, noted that Russian jets  would continue to fly missions close to the Turkish border because that was simply where the Islamist extremists were  located.It should be noted that the Russian president also blasted Turkey for being lax in its border controls, essentially allowing Islamic State terrorists to move across the Turkish border to and from Syria with virtual impunity, benefiting from its transportation and sales of oil revenues.  Putin said, ""We established a long time ago that large quantities of oil and oil products from territory captured by Islamic State have been arriving on Turkish territory. And now we get stabbed in our back and our planes, which are fighting terrorism, are struck. This despite the fact that we signed an agreement with our American partners to warn each other about air-to-air incidents and Turkey ... announced it was allegedly fighting against terrorism as part of the U.S. coalition.""With Turkey being a NATO member, Russia's wrath could potentially affect all Western countries participating in the United States-led coalition fighting Islamic State in the region.  Hopes for greater cooperation between the West and Russia against the terror group were thus dimmed.  In a small positive sign, however, both Moscow and Ankara made clear that they were not interested in escalating tensions and facilitating the path of war.As well,  despite being NATO allies, France and the United States called on Turkey to do a better job of monitoring its borders which Islamic State terrorists were using to traverse in and out of Syria.  Of particular note was a stretch of the Syrian-Turkish border north of the Syrian city of Aleppo where Turkey had not closed and was being used by the terror group to transport militants and supplies.Of course, the truth of the matter was that neither Turkey nor Russia has been involved in the Syrian civil war for the principal purpose of fighting Islamic State in the first place.  Turkey was one of the initial voices calling for Bashar Assad to go and has directly supported Sunni rebel groups fighting the Assad regime in Syria.  At the same time, Turkey has exploited the excuse of fighting Islamic State to instead go after Kurdish extremists, which  it deems to be a political threat.  On the other side of the equation, Russia has been a long-time backed of the Assad regime, and has often treated Syria like a client state.  Russia entered the Syrian quagmire on the basis of claims that it was fighting Islamic State but it, instead, hit rebel targets in Syrian territory that were opposed to the Assad regime.  In many senses, Turkey and Russia were already in opposed political ""camps"" with regard to the Syrian crisis before the latest contretemps over Turkey shooting down a Russian jet.In December 2015, in the aftermath of Turkey's decision to shoot-down a Russian jet, ties between the two countries eroded further.  At issue was  Turkey's claim  that a marine aboard a Russian naval ship  was aggressively displaying a missile launcher as the Caesar Kunikov vessel sailed through the Bosphorus in  Istanbul.  Turkey summoned the Russian envoy for consultations as a result.  As well,  the Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu cast the incident as a provocation, saying, ""The showing off of a missile by a soldier on a Russian warship, or other things such as anti-aircraft weapons, is pure provocation.""  The Russian Foreign Ministry dismissed Turkey's concerns, with spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, citing the 1936 Montreux Convention, which regulates ship movements through the Bosphorus Straits, and  declaring that  ""the protection of a ship is the legal right of any crew.""Meanwhile, a Russian news crew was arrested in Turkey's Hatay province  on the  border with Syria and subsequently deported.  That action was not expected to help improve already-damaged bilateral ties between the two countries.Special NotePeace Progress and Obstacles in SyriaAt the start of 2016, the United  Nations announced that the Syrian peace talks had commenced in the Swiss city of Geneva, with delegates from the opposition and representatives from the Assad regime meeting with  United Nations Envoy Staffan de Mistura.  The two sides were not at the same table for these negotiations; instead, these ""proximity talks"" were ensuing in separate rooms.  It should be noted that the peace talks occurred even as Syria's pro-Assad forces, backed by Russian air strikes, were carrying out a massive offensive operation close to Aleppo.  Syrian rebels pointed to the fact that this operation was going on despite the understanding that such actions should cease in order to give the peace process a chance.In mid-February 2016, United States Secretary of State John Kerry announced that an agreement had been forged to seek a cessation of hostilities in Syria, and which would set the path for humanitarian aid to be transported to war-torn cities.  Despite this favorable development, the fact of the matter was that Russian air power continued to strike targets in Syria deemed to be enemies of the Assad regime.  As well, Syrian President Assad was intensifying his forces' efforts to regain control over Aleppo, which he indicated would only be the start of a national campaign to retake control of the country.  Secretary of State  Kerry thus warned that the aforementioned agreement to end hostilities would only remain relevant if Syria and its Russian and Iranian allies made good on their commitments.By the  last week of February 2016, the United States and Russia appeared to have reached some concurrence and issued a joint statement announcing that the ceasefire would commence on Feb. 27, 2016 and would apply to all parties in the Syrian conflict, with  terrorist groups such as the Islamic State and al-Nusra being the exceptions.Special EntryUkraine investigating charges of corruption involving top  Trump AdviserIn mid-August 2016, the New York Times -- in a bombshell story -- reported that handwritten ledgers were found in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev that linked Paul Manafort, the chairman of Republican Donald Trump's presidential campaign, to more than $12 million in undisclosed cash payments.The payments in the so-called ""black ledger"" appeared to have been dispatched during a period when Manafort served as an adviser to the government of the ousted Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. The documents also seemed to link Manafort with the Russian oligarch, Oleg Deripaska.  There was also a dubious connection involving the purchase of Ukrainian cable television assets.As such, Ukraine's National Anti-corruption Bureau was investigating the ledgers to see if they constituted evidence of  corruption within the former Yanukovych regime. Of note was the fact that Yanukovych was considered a stalwart of the Russian Kremlin.By the third week of August 2016, a Ukrainian member of parliament, Serhiy Leshchenko, indicated that payments to Manafort were made by the Party of Regions -- the political party of Yanukovych. According to Leshchenko, the payments to Manafort were geared towards financing technological equipment, research services, and election polling.During a news conference, Leshchenko, a member of Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko's parliamentary bloc, said, ""Manafort didn't work for free in Ukraine, he served the Party of Regions for over 10 years and it is clear that his work was paid."" He elaborated, ""The money was transferred in cash and it is impossible to trace the transactions, but I have no doubt as to the authenticity of these documents.""For his part, Manafort denied the allegations about him. He declared, ""I have never received a single off-the-books cash payment as falsely reported by The New York Times, nor have I ever done work for the governments of Ukraine or Russia."" But Leshchenko reacted to this assertion by stating. ""If Mr Manafort denies any allegations, I think he has to be interrogated into this case and prove his position that he was not involved.""Around the same period -- the third week of August 2016 -- the Associated Press (AP) said it has obtained emails indicating that Manafort's company, which had lobbied for Yanukovych, likely did not meet legal requirements. At issue was the lack of disclosure by Manafort in regard to its efforts to advocate and lobby public opinion on behalf of Yanukovych. According to the AP, United States law would require Manafort's firm to register and disclose in detail its role as a foreign agent to the Justice Department.

Special Entry                                                           Russian ambassador to Turkey assassinated in Ankara; Russia and Turkey form fragile Syrian ceasefire                                                            In December 2016,  the Russian ambassador to  Turkey, Andrei Karlov, was assassinated in the Turkish capital city of Ankara.  The assailant was identified as a Turkish policeman, Mevlut Mert Altintas, who was reportedly protesting Russia's involvement in the Syrian regime's bombardment of the flashpoint city, Aleppo.                                                              The gruesome scene of the assassination was recorded on video and showed Karolov being shot to death by Altinas, who screamed ""don't forget about Aleppo, don't forget about Syria."" He was shot to death by Turkish police shortly thereafter.                                                            Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in a telephone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin that the act was one of ""provocation"" intended to damage ties between their two countries.   In his own address at home  in Russia, Putin appeared to echo that sentiment, starting that the killing of Karlov was aimed at disrupting bilateral ties and the peace process in Syria.                                                            It should be noted that in the week after the horrific assassination of Karlov, Russia and Turkey agreed to a ceasefire plan for Syria.   The plan was announced on Dec. 29, 2016 and involved a truce between the Syrian government and rebel opposition, with Russia and Turkey acting as the guarantors.  Significantly, the United States was not a party to the agreement. 

Special Report:                                                           U.S. officials accuse Russia of trying to interfere in and influence presidential election                                                          - Russia accused of hacking of election databases and DNC in order to influence U.S. election                                                          - U.S. intelligence investigating ties between Trump advisers and Russian Kremlin                                                          - U.S. officials promises proportional response to Russian hacking activity                                                          - Intelligence indicates inference from Russian government in the political affairs of the United States                                                          - U.S. President Barack Obama sanctions Russia for interfering in 2016 presidential election                                                          - U.S. intelligence notifies Obama and Trump of allegations that Russia holds compromising information about Trump                                                          Russia accused of hacking of election databases and DNC in order to influence U.S. election --

In late August 2016, it was reported that two state election databases had been penetrated and United States officials indicated that  Russian hackers were responsible.

While the two states were not formally named, media outlets indicated that Illinois and Arizona were the targeted states.  In the Illinois case,  the voter registration system was breached as hackers stole personal information on approximately 200,000 voters.  In the Arizona case, the voter registration system as subject to malicious software.  These cybercrimes were the latest in a stream of many attributed to Russia.

By October 2016,  United States officials were saying that Russia had hacked into the Florida state electoral system.

Going back to July 2016, the United States government said that cyber attacks on the Democratic National Committee were likely carried out by the Russian government.

While Russia has denied any such activity,  United States officials made clear that Russia appeared to be trying to influence the United states 2016 presidential election.

Note that in an interview with Bloomberg News, Russian President Vladimir Putin denied his country's involvement in the hacking of the Democratic National Committee.  He said, ""I don't know anything about it...and on a state level Russia has never done this.""  Putin added, ""Listen, does it even matter who hacked this data?""                                                    U.S. intelligence investigating ties between Trump adviser and Russian Kremlin --

At the close of September 2016, United States media reported that intelligence officials in that country were investigating whether an American businessman had spurious ties to the Russian Krelim.  Carter Page, a former investment banker and an adviser to Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump, was believed to have engaged in communications with high ranking Russian government officials.  These communications involved discussions of the lifting of economic sanctions against Russia under a Trump presidency but also extended to suspected efforts by Russia to influence the United States presidential election. On the record, Page was known to have made no shortage of pro-Russian statements that undermined the Obama administration's policy regarding Russia,  particularly with regard to the Russian annexation of the Ukrainian territory of Crimea.

Of concern for United States legislators who were briefed on the matter was the possibility of a Trump insider working with Russia to undermine United States foreign policy.  To this end, two ranking Democrats in Congress, Senator  Dianne Feinstein and Representative Adam Schiff released a joint statement  asserting that their briefings did, indeed, indicate an effort by Russian influence to play a role in the United States election. Their joint statement read, ""Based on briefings we have received, we have concluded that the Russian intelligence agencies are making a serious and concerted effort to influence the U.S. election."" They added, ""At the least, this effort is intended to sow doubt about the security of our election and may well be intended to influence the outcomes of the election.""                                                  U.S. officials accuse Russia of seeking to interfered with U.S. election; promises proportional response --                                                  At the start of October 2016, United States intelligence officials issued an unprecedented announcement, asserting that Russia was seeking ""to interfere with the U.S. election process"" by hacking political organizations and key individuals. As discussed in Section 1 of this report, United States officials had already indicated that Russia was likely behind the hacking of state election databases and the Democratic National Committee.  Now, they were going further to make it clear by ""naming and shaming"" Russia for its role in violating the privacy of internal communications systems and seeking to influence the United States election.                                                    The issue had political implications with the Democratic Party's presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, saying during the second presidential debate, ""We have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election.""  Her rival, Republican nominee, Donald Trump, had a different view and instead appeared to defend Russia, as he said. ""She doesn't know if it's the Russians doing the hacking.  Maybe there is no hacking."" It was possible that Trump genuinely did not believe that Russia was behind the interference into the United States system due to his allegiance to Russian President Vladimir Putin.  However, as a presidential contender, Trump received classified intelligence briefings, which undoubtedly included evidence of the Russian hacking scheme.   His continued advocacy on behalf of Russia has thus raised questions about the Republican nominee's commitment to United States national security interests.                                                    There remained some debate as to whether the Putin government in Russia was merely seeking to undermine the public's trust in the United States system with its hacking activity, or, if it was outright seeking to facilitate a Trump presidency.  There was some suggestion of the latter motivation in three arenas.  Stated differently, there were signs that Putin and Russia favored a Trump presidency and were willing to nudge things in that direction. 

First, leaked emails and speech excerpts clearly aimed at damaging Clinton, such as that of her campaign chairman John Podesta,  have been linked to Russia through the WikiLeaks website.  The timing of the leaks seemed geared towards hurting Democrats, and particularly the Democratic nominee, with no equivalent leaks related to the Republican nominee.  This, in and of itself, suggested that Wikileaks was hardly an entity championing modern transparency but one with a particularized political agenda.  Second, an ultra-nationalist stalwart of Putin, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, made clear in an interview with  Reuters news that Trump was the only person able to ease tensions between Moscow and Washington. By contrast, he suggested a Clinton presidency could spark World War III. Zhirinovsky's stance could well be interpreted as a proxy opinion from the Putin regime itself that it favors a Trump presidency.  Third,  Trump himself in the second presidential debate expressed a foreign policy on Syria, for example, that was in lockstep with that of Putin, while eschewing that of his own running mate, Mike Pence.                                                 Intelligence indicates inference from Russian government in the political affairs of the United States --

In December 2016, United States intelligence officials  concluded that with ""a high level of confidence"" that Russian President Vladimir Putin was personally involved in a clandestine Russian operation to interfere in the United States presidential election.

As reported by NBC News, intelligence findings indicated that  Putin was personally involved in deciding how hacked material on  Democrats was leaked and exploited to harm the prospects of Democratic presidential contender, Hillary Clinton. 

According to United States intelligence, Putin's motivation was sparked by a  ""vendetta"" against Hillary Clinton. That revenge impulse was due to her criticism of parliamentary elections in Russia that resulted in a close result for the Russian president's party years earlier.  But that vendetta was soon transformed into a wider effort to create divisions with United States allies, undermine American influence and authority on the global scene, while fomenting dissension at home in the United States by creating the impression of a corrupt political system in the United States.  All of these trajectories would have the collective effect of strengthening Russia's hand internationally. 

According to CIA reports, the concrete findings were that the  Russian government wanted to damage Clinton's candidacy while helping to elect Donald Trump.  Knowing that  it would only be possible for Russia's highest ranking  officials to have authorized these activities, it was clear that Putin was directing the operation.

In interviews with media, Michael McFaul,  ambassador to Russia from 2012 to 2014,  noted that these findings were consistent with understanding of the Russian leader.  He said, ""It is most certainly consistent with the Putin that I have watched and used to work with when I was an ambassador and in the government.""  He added of Putin, ""He has had a vendetta against Hillary Clinton, that has been known for a long time because of what she said about his elections back in the parliamentary elections of 2011. He wants to discredit American democracy and make us weaker in terms of leading the liberal democratic order. And most certainly he likes President-elect  Trump."" 

In late December 2016, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)  co-authored a report with the Department of Homeland Security in which it blamed  Russian intelligence services for interfering in the 2016 United States presidential election. Included in the report was evidence in the form of   samples of malicious computer code  used in a  hacking scheme dating back to 2015.   There was also a linkage between Russian intelligence and the hacking of the Democratic National Committee — a move that was believed to have influenced the 2016 presidential election. 

While Russia has throughout denied the hacking allegations, it was apparent that the United States government had a decisive view on the problematic role played by Moscow.  Indeed, the issue has come to embody the nadir in U.S.-Russian relations in decades. 

U.S. President Obama sanctions Russia for interfering in 2016 presidential election --

On the same day that the aforementioned FBI report was released, United States President Barack Obama announced several retaliatory measures against Russia for its interference activities and warned of more to come.  Of note was the sanctioning of Russian intelligence and military services, and the expulsion of 35 Russian intelligence operatives.   As well,  in response to the harassment against American diplomats in Moscow, the U.S. closed two Russian intelligence gathering compounds in New York and Maryland.

In a statement, President Obama said, ""These actions follow repeated private and public warnings that we have issued to the Russian government, and are a necessary and appropriate response to efforts to harm U.S. interests in violation of established international norms of behavior.""  He added, ""These actions are not the sum total of our response to Russia's aggressive activities. We will continue to take a variety of actions at a time and place of our choosing, some of which will not be publicized.""  The United States leader also said that his administration would soon deliver a report to the Congress detailing the Russian interference effort in the 2016 election. 

Of significance has been President-elect Donald Trump's reticence to accept the findings of Russian interference from U.S. intelligence agencies.  Also of note has been Trump's curious effusive praise  for Russian President Vladimir Putin — especially at a time when the sitting U.S. President Barack Obama was in the process of sanctioning Russia.  Via the social media outlet, Twitter, Trump lauded the Russia president's decision to delay his own retaliatory actions, saying, ""Great move on delay (by V. Putin) - I always knew he was very smart!"" 

For his part, Putin responded to the news by saying, ""We will not expel anyone"" and indicating he would wait for the incoming Trump administration to react as he said, ""Further steps towards the restoration of Russian-American relations will be built on the basis of the policy which the administration of President D. Trump will carry out.""

By the start of 2017, a declassified report by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence concludes that Russia undertook an effort sought to help elect Trump by  undermining the credibility of Clinton.

Key points of that report were as follows:

""Russian efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election represent the most recent expression of Moscow's longstanding desire to undermine the U.S.-led liberal democratic order, but these activities demonstrated a significant escalation in directness, level of activity, and scope of effort compared to previous operations.""

""We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election. Russia's goals were to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency.""

""We further assess Putin and the Russian government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.""

Of those three findings above, the writers noted ""We have high confidence in these judgments.""

The report also declared the following:

""We also assess Putin and the Russian Government aspired to help President-elect Trump's election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him.""

Of those findings above, the writers noted ""All three agencies agree with this judgment. CIA and FBI have high confidence in this judgment; NSA has moderate confidence.""

Further findings of the report were as follows:

""When it appeared to Moscow that Secretary Clinton was likely to win the election, the Russian influence campaign began to focus more on undermining her future presidency.""

""Further information has come to light since Election Day that, when combined with Russian behavior since early November 2016, increases our confidence in our assessments of Russian motivations and goals.""

In terms of strategy, the writers of the report made the following observation:

""Moscow's influence campaign followed a Russian messaging strategy that blends covert intelligence operations — such as cyber activity — with overt efforts by Russian Government agencies, state-funded media, third-party intermediaries, and paid social media users or 'trolls'.""

Read the full report here: https://www.dni.gov /files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf

For his part, Trump has dismissed such suggestions, at one point suggesting a technologically savvy teenager may have been responsible for cybersecurity violations, or even China, which was blamed for previous hacking operations.  But throughout, Trump has been reluctant to place the blame on Russia, and instead referred to the entire line of inquiry as ""a political witch hunt.'

Following a briefing from United States intelligence, Trump continued to downplay the role of Russian actors in his election, declaring instead:  ""There was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election, including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines.""

Meanwhile, outgoing President Barack Obama admitted in an interview with ABC News that he ""underestimated"" the impact of the  apparent Russian campaign of misinformation and computer hacking, as well as its effects on a democracy.  President Obama said, ""I think that I underestimated the degree to which, in this new information age, it is possible for misinformation for cyber hacking and so forth to have an impact on our open societies, our open systems, to insinuate themselves into our democratic practices in ways that I think are accelerating."" 

President Obama also warned against the close ties with Russia promised by Trump, as he said,  ""One of the things that I am concerned about is the degree to which we've seen a lot of commentary lately where there were, there are Republicans or pundits or cable commentators who seemed to have more confidence in Vladimir Putin than fellow Americans because those fellow Americans were Democrats. That cannot be.  We have to remind ourselves we're on the same team. Vladimir Putin's not on our team. If we get to a point where people in this country feel more affinity with a leader who is an adversary and view the United States and our way of life as a threat to him, then we're gonna have bigger problems than just cyber hacking.""

U.S. intelligence notifies Obama and Trump of allegations that Russia holds compromising information about Trump --

The issue of Russian interference into the United States political system took a dark and twisted turn on Jan. 10, 2016, when  CNN reported that classified documents presented to  both President Obama and  Trump included allegations that Russian operatives had compromising  personal and financial information about the president-elect.   The report also included an explosive suggestion of an exchange of information during the campaign between Trump surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government.

These allegations outlined in the intelligence report  given to Obama and Trump were derived partially — but not completely — from memos of a former credible British intelligence operative.  However, there were indications that there were other sources of the ""kompromat""  leak.

It was unknown if the salacious details of the ""kompromat""  leak constituted the reference point for then-Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, who dispatched a letter to Director James Comes of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in October 2016 that read as follows: ""It has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government -- a foreign interest openly hostile to the United States.""  Reid urged Comey to release this information, which the FBI director clearly opted not to do.

For his part,  Trump dismissed the claims that Russia had compromising information about him.  Via the social media outlet, Twitter, he declared,  ""FAKE NEWS - A TOTAL POLITICAL WITCH HUNT.""

But Trump would have a difficult time maintaining the claim that the allegations outlined by CNN were fake once the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), James Clapper, acknowledged it on the record on Jan. 11, 2017.   The outgoing DNI head released a statement that read:  ""This evening, I had the opportunity to speak with President-elect Donald Trump to discuss recent media reports about our briefing last Friday. I expressed my profound dismay at the leaks that have been appearing in the press, and we both agreed that they are extremely corrosive and damaging to our national security.""  In so doing, Clapper was essentially confirming that the ""kompromat""  information did exist and had circulated through the government, the intelligence agencies, and the media.

Trump picks fight with CIA chief eliciting criticism from Brennan --

Meanwhile Trump was embroiled in a public fight with the head of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA),  Director John Brennan.  The conflict was sparked when Trump accused Brennan of leaking the ""kompromat"" information, detailing tawdry sexual activities in Moscow, to the public.  Brennan not only dismissed those charges but also warned Trump that he would have to be responsible about national security and not just tweet about it.  Brennan additionally warned that Trump's impulsive tendencies could be a detriment to national security.

Trump retaliated by accusing Brennan of being behind the leaked report of Trump's alleged sexual activities registered by Russia.  Via Twitter, Trump asked, ""Was this the leaker of Fake News?""

But Brennan had his own advice for Trump, who was again displaying a penchant for public fights on social media.  Brennan said in an interview with Fox News of the incoming president, ""Spontaneity is not something that protects national security interests and so, therefore, when he speaks or when he reacts, just make sure he understands that the implications and impact on the United States could be profound.""  Brennan also expressed doubt that Trump understood the threat to national security posed by Russia, as he said, ""I don't think he has a full appreciation of Russian capabilities, Russia's intentions and actions.""

In the background of these developments was a bipartisan push by the United States Senate to impose comprehensive sanctions on Russia in response to its alleged attempts to influence the 2016 presidential election.  As well, a Senate intelligence committee inquiry was in the offing about the Russian interference angle — a measure likely to take on greater importance given the revelations that Trump adviser, Flynn, had at least five conversations with a Russian envoy.

The incoming Trump administration in the United States telegraphed compatible geopolitical interests with Russia, especially with regard to the security alliance NATO.  For some time, Russian President Vladimir Putin has signaled distaste for NATO's influence in Europe — particularly in eastern European countries once under the control of the United Soviet Socialist Republic.  There was , thus, no secret that Putin wished to see diminished NATO power in the region.  Trump's repeated disparagement of NATO, including his declaration in 2016 and again in January 2017 that the security body was ""obsolete"" indicated a  merging of interests between the two former Cold War rivals.

In an interview with the media in January 2017, Trump said, ""I took such heat, when I said NATO was obsolete. It's obsolete because it wasn't taking care of terror. I took a lot of heat for two days. And then they started saying Trump is right.""  He also suggested that smaller NATO countries were not paying enough for protection from United States.   He said, ""A lot of these countries aren't paying what they're supposed to be paying, which I think is very unfair to the United States.""  Left unsaid by Trump was the fact that many of those small NATO countries sent forces to Afghanistan to fight al Qaida after the United States was attacked in 2001.

Meanwhile, Russia welcomed Trump's characterization of NATO as ""obsolete.""  Putin's spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, reacted by saying,  ""NATO is indeed a vestige [of the past] and we agree with that.""  Peskov added,  ""Considering that [NATO] is focused on confrontation and its entire structure is devoted to the ideals of confrontation, then, of course, this can hardly be called a modern structure meeting the ideas of stability, sustainable development, and security.""

The merging of United States and Russian interests was also brought into high relief when Trump suggested that he might end some economic sanctions against Russia in exchange for a nuclear arms reduction deal.   While this notion was being interpreted as a sign of trump's claimed ""deal making"" acumen, the Russian Kremlin quickly dismissed the notion of such an agreement.  At first, the Kremlin said that it was premature to respond to Trump's offer of such a deal, but later Russian lawmakers indicated that there would be no security concessions made in exchange for sanctions relief.

",510320,"SEOUL: 11 May 2018 (Yonhap News Agency) U.S. President Donald Trump appears open to lowering the bar for a big deal in denuclearization talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, though he's not considering moving the goal post itself, a well-known pundit here said Friday.

In their summit to be held in Singapore on June 12, Trump apparently believes sticking to an agreement and attaining a nuclear-free peninsula is more important than setting a tight deadline, according to Jun Bong-geun, chief of security and unification studies at the state-run Korean National Diplomatic Academy.

Ridding the North of its nuclear program is expected to ""take a very long time,"" despite the Trump administration's push for a speedy process. U.S. officials said they want significant progress in six to 12 months with the aim of completing the work before the next U.S. presidential election in November 2020.

Jun said there could be a ""point of compromise"" between Trump and Kim on the road map for the denuclearization of Korea for a package deal.

He was speaking to reporters on a ""new alternative"" reportedly suggested by Trump.

Meeting with Kim in Pyongyang earlier this week, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo conveyed Trump's verbal message on the unspecified proposal, said the North's official news agency KCNA.

Kim ""highly appreciated that the U.S. president has shown deep interest in settling the issue through dialogue,"" it said.

It was not immediately confirmed whether the new offer was about a specific denuclearization schedule, method or the logistics of their upcoming summit.

Jun noted that it's a common strategy to put forward maximum demands before difficult negotiations or in the early stage of talks and lower the bar later to pull off an agreement.

In that sense, the U.S. is expected to take a rather flexible stance on the time frame, while sticking to the goal of achieving the complete, verifiable, irreversible dismantlement (CVID) of the North's nuclear arsenal.

Pompeo once used the word PVID (permanent, verifiable, irreversible dismantlement) to highlight the importance of permanent denuclearization, sparking media speculation here about Washington's intentions, but the Trump administration has returned to the CVID jargon.

Encouraged by the release of three American hostages from North Korea, Trump publicly said, ""Some great things can happen"" in his Singapore meeting with Kim.

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis also said, ""There is reason for some optimism that these talks could be fruitful.""

The thornier issue, however, will be the scope of inspections and verification, Jun pointed out.

The U.S. will likely seek ""unlimited"" inspections of the North's nuclear arms inventory and facilities, but Pyongyang will try to allow the monitoring or supervision of its work to ""freeze or shut down"" nuclear activities, he added.",17,"The U.S. will likely seek ""unlimited"" inspections of the North's nuclear arms inventory and facilities, but Pyongyang will try to allow the monitoring or supervision of its work to ""freeze or shut down"" nuclear activities, he added.",0.2637441158294678,8.407433986663817,3

",633574,"General Relations

North Korea is one of the most isolated communist countries in the world. For several decades, it carried out a policy of self-reliance and self-sufficiency and refused to establish relations with countries it identified as capitalist or imperialist Western countries. Its relationship with South Korea also formed much of its post-World War II history and still drives much of its foreign policy. Recent developments in the country have shown dramatic changes in its foreign policy. In the past few years, North Korea has established diplomatic relations with many Western countries, and its relations with South Korea have had a tremendous breakthrough since the North-South summit in 2000. Since 2001, however, the chill in relations with the United States (U.S.) has had negative repercussions on North Korea's relations with several other countries. It was yet to be seen if the new Obama administration (as of 2009)would augur a shift in the diplomatic climate.

Regional RelationsIntroduction

North Korea is situated at the northern part of the Korean peninsula between the Sea of Japan and the Yellow Sea. Japan lies east of the peninsula across the Sea of Japan. North Korea shares borders with the People's Republic of China along the Yalu River and with China and Russia along the Tumen River.

Relations with South Korea

The military demarcation line (MDL) between North and South Korea has formed the boundary between the two since the close of the Korean War in the early 1950s. A demilitarized zone (DMZ) extends for 2,000 meters on either side of the MDL. However, both the North and South Korean governments hold that the MDL is only a temporary administrative line, not a permanent border.

For decades after the Korean War, both Korean governments had repeatedly reiterated their desire to reunify the Korean peninsula. Until 1971, however, the two governments had no direct contacts or communications. In 1972, a series of secret meetings resulted in the announcement of an agreement by South and North Korea aimed at working toward peaceful reunification and an end to the hostile atmosphere prevailing on the peninsula. In 1994, after former U.S. President Carter's visit to North Korea in June, North and South Korea agreed to hold a summit in July. The two sides went ahead with plans for the summit, but it was cancelled because of Kim Il Sung's sudden death on July 8, 1994.

In April 2000, the governments of the two Koreas reached an agreement to hold the first-ever summit in Pyongyang. From June 13-15, 2000, North Korean leader Kim Jong il and South Korean President Kim Dae-jung held the summit in Pyongyang. The two leaders reached a historic agreement during the summit to reduce tensions between the two sides of the peninsula and work towards the reunification. The two leaders also agreed that North Korean leader Kim Jong il would pay a return visit to SouthKorea in the near future.

Since the June 2000 summit, considerable achievements have been made in improving relationship between North and South Korea. In August and November 2000, two rounds of family reunion events took place in the Korean Peninsula. The two Koreas have also started working on the transport re-link between the two sides by reconnecting the railway between the capital cities of the two.

Government officials from North and South Korea have been keeping in contact since the summit, holding meetings regularly to discuss matters of reunification and cooperation.

As noted above, however, since 2001, North Korea's relations with its neighbors have become strained. The declaration by the United States that North Korea is part of an ""axis of evil"" in 2002 is believed (by some, not all) to have spurred the restarting of a nuclear program in the country. The prospect of a nuclear North Korea caused panic and anxiety in the region and across the wider world. North Korea's announcements -- as recent as 2006 -- that it has successfully developed nuclear weaponry, has not helped the situation. The test-firing of missiles and the unprecedented test of a nuclear weapon in 2006 served only to worsen relations across the border, and also within the region. However, progress on nuclear disarmament, which began to move progressively forward at the start of 2007, may contribute to a significant shift. (See below for further details.)

In mid-July 2007, North Korea said that it shut down its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon. A team of inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was monitoring the situation at Yongbyon in order to verify Pyongyang's claim. Nevertheless, the announcement was welcomed by the countries of the West, the wider world, and particularly by the countries participating in multilateral talks with North Korea aimed at disarmament.

In October 2007, South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun and the North Korea's leader Kim Jong-il signed a joint declaration calling for a permanent peace agreement on the Korean Peninsula. The eight-point declaration set forth an agenda for international dialogue aimed at crafting a treaty, which would replace the existing armistice that brought an end to the Korean War that took place from 1950 to 1953. The declaration also came on the heels of a significant announcement by North Korea that it  would end its nuclear ambitions.

In July 2008, a South Korean woman was shot to death by a North Korean soldier. North Korean authorities said that the 53-year old woman strayed from the special tourism zone in the mountains into a restricted area of the Mount Kumgang resort. More than one million South Korean visitors have traveled to the resort, which is located in a strategic nazal area, in the last decade without any such incident occurring. South Korean authorities responded by suspending cross-border trips, pending an investigation. Because cross-border tourism trips have been the fulcrum of economic and cultural cooperation in the last decade, the incident had the potential to adversely affect cross-border relations. It was viewed as a setback at the time when fresh dialogue with North Korea was being considered.

In 2009, peninsula relations became increasingly complex due to provocative actions taken by North Korea, including an underground nuclear test and a series of missile tests. See below in the section called ""Recent Developments"" for more details.

That said, South Korea and North Korea agreed to the arrange reunions for separated families from either side of the Korean peninsula. The reunions were scheduled to be held from September 26, 2009 to October 1, 2009 in the Mount Gumgang area. The agreement was forged following talks between delegates from the respective Red Cross societies in North Korea and South Korea. A joint statement read as follows: ""The South and the North will continue to cooperate on the issue of separated families and other humanitarian issues involving the Red Cross."" The program of reuniting Korean families commenced in 2000 following a landmark inter-Korean summit. Since that time, the two sides have held several reunions and orchestrated a number of video exchanges although the last such meetings took place in October 2007. Soon thereafter, South Korea's hard line government of President LeeMyung-bak came to power, bilateral relations devolved, and the program was suspended. This 2009 agreement could be illustrative of a possible breakthrough between the two sides.

****See below for further coverage of relations between the two Koreas.****Relations with Japan

Relations between North Korea and Japan have saw significant developments in the past decade. As early as 1990, North Korea and Japan began negotiations in Pyongyang on the establishment of diplomatic ties. Taking it as a prerequisite for normalizing relations with Japan, North Korea has been demanding an apology and compensation from Japan for its colonial occupation of Korea in the first half of the 20th century. For their part, Japan has been asking for information of the alleged abduction by North Korean agents of Japanese citizens in the 1960s and 1970s, which has been denied by North Korea. After eight rounds of talks, these issues still remained unresolved and finally brought the rapprochement talks to a rapture in late 1992.

Relations deteriorated in September 1998 when Japan imposed sanctions on North Korea following the country performed a test launch of missiles over Japan. In December 1999, the two countries agreed to resume talks when a Japanese delegation visited Pyongyang. Later, Japan lifted sanctions on North Korea. All these paved the way for the negotiations on the normalization of relations between North Korea and Japan held in Pyongyang on April 5-7, 2000, after seven years of interruption. In August and October 2000, North Korea and Japan held another two rounds of talks, one in Tokyo, the other in Beijing. Although the negotiations did not make tangible progress, they have served as a good start toward the normalization of bilateral relations.

In September 2002, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi of Japan held a summit meeting with Kim Jong il. The focus of the meeting was to foster improved relationships between Japan and North Korea. The meeting signaled an interesting drift in Japanese foreign policy towards a view independent of the United States on policy in North Korea. At that time in 2002, North Korea forged a concord with Japan by which both parties agreed to a moratorium on missile tests. It was an agreement that was reaffirmedin 2004.

Nuclear development (discussed throughout this ""Country Review"") have served to severely strain relations between North Korea and Japan once again. The test firing of missiles and the enactment of a nuclear weapons test in 2006 effectively abrogated the existing concord between the two countries. The state of the diplomatic discussions on nuclear disarmament from 2007 through 2009, along with new leadership in the United States, may well contribute to a shift in bilateral relations.

Relations with China

North Korea and China have generally had good ties due to the fact that both countries are communist states. China has, however, worked with the West to resolve issues related to North Korea's controversial nuclear program. Indeed, it has encouraged North Korea to participate in multilateral talks on the matter. In 2005, the Chinese government assured United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice that it would push multi-party talks with North Korea, which would be aimed at ending the nuclear crisis on the Korean peninsula. A year later, there as no progress on this front. For its part, however, North Korea said it had no interest in re-entering such talks, which stalled in recent years. Nevertheless, multilateral talks resumed again in December 2006 and January 2007; see below for more recent details related to North Korea's nuclear program and the multilateral negotiations on the matter.Other Important RelationsGeneral Overview

In recent years, two major developments of events in North Korea have brought about changes in the country's international relations. In 1995 and 1996, massive flooding resulted in an agricultural disaster in North Korea, which forced the North Korean government to give up its self-sufficiency policy in order to request food aid from foreign countries. China, the United States, Japan and other nations have responded to donate food supply to North Korea.

In contrast to its severe food shortage as well as numerous deaths caused by the famine, North Korea's development of nuclear technology and missile delivery systems has led to tensions and negotiations with Japan, China, South Korea and the United States in the past few years. In the mid 1990s, a series of agreements between the North Korean and other governments led to foreign assistance in developing North Korea's nuclear energy capabilities in exchange for regular international inspections of North Korea's nuclear facilities. Since 2002, however, North Korea has moved away from those agreement and advanced a strong nuclear program, including the development of nuclear weapons, to the grave dismay of the global community. Progress on nuclear disarmament, however, was noted in late 2006 and early 2007. The effects on the climate of foreign relations was yet to be determined.

Notable Ties

North Korea has made other diplomatic initiatives to break its decades-long isolation. In January 2000, North Korea and Italy established diplomatic relations, and in May, North Korea established diplomatic ties with Australia. In July 2000, North Korea joined the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) forum, with its foreign minister holding talks with his counterparts from ASEAN nations for the first time.

North Korea established diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom in December 2000, and with the Netherlands and Canada in January 2001. Other Western nations including Germany, France, Spain and Belgium have also expressed their willingness to normalize relations with North Korea.

Relations with the United States

The Perry Report, prepared by the United States (U.S.) special advisor on North Korea, was released in September 1999 and outlined a new approach to foreign policy regarding North Korea. The report called for the normalization of ties with North Korea and a cessation of attempts to depose the government. Perry recommended a reduction of sanctions in order to prevent North Korea from developing a nuclear weapons program. Moreover, the United States sought to disarm North Korea's nuclear program by helping to provide fuel aid to North Korea to help prevent the processing of nuclear fuel that can be turned into atomic weapons. For several years following the end of the Cold War, North Korea had focused its diplomatic activities on relations with the United States in its belief that improved relations with Washington, D.C. was crucial for the survival of the regime. The United States has been the largest grain donor to North Korea. But North Korea had complained that the United States had often ignored its desire to improve relations, believing that it paid attention to North Korea only when it launched provocative steps by resorting to nuclear weapons or missile development programs.

For years, North Korea tried to reach around South Korean leaders to strike a deal with the United States (U.S.), and the U.S. government insisted that direct dialogue between North and South Korea must come first. The U.S. goal had been to induce impoverished North Korea to drop its weapons of mass destruction program and fully turn from supporting terrorism. Then in June 2000, only a few days after the historic summit between the leaders of both Koreas, the United States made a decision to ease wide-ranging sanctions imposed on North Korea. This move has cleared the way for financial transactions and trade in all but the most sensitive goods between the two countries. In addition, it was intended to permit new air and shipping service between North Korea and the United States.

In October 2000, former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright paid a two-day visit to North Korea, being the most senior American official ever to go to the country. Albright's visit was seen as groundbreaking as well as opening a new chapter in U.S.-North Korea relations. During the visit, Albright and the North Korean leader Kim Jong il held several talks covering a full range of issuesincluding terrorism, human rights and concrete steps for tension reduction on the Korean Peninsula. One week after Albright's visit, North Korea and the United States held discussions in Malaysia on the development of ballistic missiles by North Korea, but it was ended without reaching an agreement.

The missile talks between the two countries focused on two key issues: North Korea's domestic long range missile program and its export of missile technology to countries such as Pakistan and Iran. The United States claimed that North Korea was the world's top exporter of missile equipment and technology to those countries. As for the missile program, the United States was exploring the idea of exchanging launches of North Korea's satellites for serious missile restraint by North Korea.

The momentum towards normalization of relations between North Korea and the outside world was slowed with the election of President George Bush in the United States (U.S.). Early in his administration President Bush ordered a review of U.S. policy towards North Korea and the Bush Administration has made it clear that improved relations with the US depended on progress across a broad range of security issues including force deployments, nuclear weapons and missiles.

The U.S.-North Korea relationship was dealt a blow with the terrorist attack against the United States on Sept. 11, 2001. The backlash by the United States against the terrorists responsible for the attack and the labeling of North Korea as a member of the ""axis of evil"" along with Iran and Iraq resulted in a retrenchment by North Korea and saber rattling by both sides. This created an awkward tensionbetween South Korea and the U.S. because of the desire by the South Korea for eventual reunification in accordance with the sunshine policy of President Kim Dee Jung of South Korea while at the same time looking to maintain a good relationship with the U.S.

The branding of North Korea as part of an ""axis of evil"" by the United States in 2002 appeared to have spurred (according to some, but not all, sources) the restarting of a nuclear program in the country, which reached a disturbing apex in 2006 when a nuclear weapon was tested. Despite assurances from the Chinese government in 2005 that it would push multi-party talks with North Korea, negotiations remained stalled. Nevertheless, talks resumed in December 2006 with the United States expressing cautious optimism on the matter of nuclear disarmament. *** Special Report:  North Korea's nuclear program Background The Korean peninsula has remained bitterly divided since the end of the Korean War in 1953. The demilitarized zone, which divides the two countries at the 38th parallel, is the world's most heavily fortified border. In 1953, the U.S. and South Korea signed a mutual defense treaty that commits the U.S. to defend South Korea against external threats. The U.S. currently has 37,000 troops in South Korea and several thousand more that could easily be deployed from U.S. bases in Japan. North Korea has the fourth largest military in the world. During the Cold War, North Korea received substantial military aid from the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union. North Korea was initially more economically developed than the South, largely due to its natural resources. However, the North's policy of economic self-reliance (juch'e) created dismal economic conditions. Much of North Korea's budgetary resources are devoted to the military. In the decades following the Korean War, South Korea's export-driven economy grew rapidly. As a result, South Korea has a much higher standard of living than the North. After the Cold War, North Korea began to generate income through drug trafficking, counterfeiting, money laundering, and exporting weapons to countries like Syria, Iran, and Pakistan. North Korea's nuclear program became a serious international issue in the early 1990s. Although North Korea joined the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) in 1985, its activities at its nuclear reactor in Yongbyon fueled suspicions that its nuclear program had non-civilian purposes. Despite signing the NPT, North Korea did not allow outside observers to inspect its nuclear facilities. Summary North Korea's nuclear program, which has likely yielded at least two nuclear bombs, is a major ongoing issue in global security. The discovery of a secret uranium enrichment program in North Korea in 2002 lead to the collapse of the 1994 Agreed Framework, which was supposed to dismantle North Korea's nuclear program. Since then, representatives from the United States (U.S.), North Korea, South Korea, Japan, China, and Russia have participated in ongoing negotiations known as the six-party talks with the aim of reaching an agreement to stop North Korea's program in exchange for a package of economic and security incentives. Although a provisional agreement was reached in September 2005, the talks were at an impasse. North Korea refused to participate until the U.S. lifts financial sanctions in place against its counterfeiting activities.  In July 2006, North Korea test fired a series of ballistic missiles, leading to a United Nations (U.N.) Security Council resolution condemning the tests and prohibiting U.N. member states from supplying North Korea with missile-related materials and technology. Despite international pressure to return to the six-party talks, North Korea was still refusing to return to the negotiations until its preconditions are met.  In October 2006, North Korea carried out an apparent test of a nuclear weapon. The international community responded to North Korea's announcement with widespread condemnation and a punitive U.N. Security Council resolution endorsing financial and security sanctions.  December 2006 marked the resumption of multilateral talks regarding North Korea's controversial nuclear program.  North Korea, South Korea, China, Japan, Russia and the United States indicated their return to the negotiating table after a year-long hiatus. While the news of the recommencement of  six-party talks was welcomed, there was also a pervasive sense of caution. Experts conveyed limited optimism about the prospects of forging a resolution amenable to all parties. Indeed, the United States has consistently expressed vociferous opposition to the notion of North Korea being a nuclear power, while North Korea has been equally adamant about its need for nuclear weapons.  These two absolutist positions have resulted in an impasse.  The December 2006 talks ended inconclusively and multilateral talks resumed again in January 2007.  By February 2007, the multilateral discussions saw some progress.  Of particular interest was an agreement  reportedly requiring Pyongyang to shut down its nuclear facilities  at Yongbyon over the course of the ensuing months, in lieu of aid, such as fuel oil provided by the United States and South Korea.  The draft agreement, which had been drafted by Chinese,  also called for the return of international inspectors to North Korea. Concurrence was forged days after talks began.  In June 2007, North Korea agreed to shut down its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon and, then, disable its nuclear facilities.  North Korea also noted that it was inviting International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors to return to North Korea to monitor the closure of its nuclear program and facilities.  To that end, IAEA inspectors were expected to visit North Korea on June 26, 2007, for the first time since their dismissal from that country in 2002.  These announcements came months after the Chinese drafted an agreement in February 2007 (as noted above), in which the closure of the reactor at Yongbyon would be secured, in lieu of heavy fuel oil that would be secured by other countries participating in the multilateral nuclear disarmament talks.The total amount of fuel oil -- one million metric tons -- appeared to more substantial that the original quantity discussed earlier in the year under the Chinese-brokered plan.  In addition, diplomatic recognition and humanitarian aid benefits were included in the deal.  Also included in the arrangement was the untangling of a financial dispute.A new round of six-party disarmament talks, which has included North Korea, South Korea, China, Japan, Russia and the United States, commenced in July 2007.In mid-July 2007, North Korea said that it shut down its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon and a team of inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was monitoring the situation at  there in order to verify Pyongyang's claim.In October 2007, South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun and the North Korea's leader Kim Jong-ilsigned a joint declaration calling for a permanent peace agreement on the Korean Peninsula.The eight-point declaration set forth an agenda for international dialogue aimed at crafting a treaty, which would replace the existing armistice that brought an end to the Korean War that took place from 1950 to 1953.  The declaration also came on the heels of a significant announcement by North Korea that it would end its nuclear ambitions.A year later  in June 2008 North Korea declared its nuclear assets.  In October 2008, the United States removed North Korea from its list of terrorism sponsors as part of the denuclearization agreement.At the end of that year, it was clear that North Korea's disarmament progress had stalled.  Then at the start of 2009, the United States reacted by suspending energy aid to North Korea. Soon thereafter, relations devolved between the two Koreas when the South Korean leader said that aid to the North would be dependent on that country's willingness to completely end its nuclear weapons program. North Korea accused South Korea of hostile intent and announced it was ending all political and military agreements with its neighbor to the south.April 2009 saw North Korea take provocative action by launching a communications satellite into space via rocket.  That claim was widely viewed as obfuscation of a missile test.Then, on May 25, 2009, less than three years after the earlier underground nuclear test, North Korea conducted a second such test, arguing the merits of its right to a military deterrent.  Prior to 2009, the last time North Korea conducted an underground nuclear test was in October 2006.By the end of the month, North Korea had fired a total of six short-range missiles and United States military officials warned that further missile launches were likely in the works.The international community reacted with outrage and condemnation to these collective actions. Not surprisingly, the UN Security Council rapidly reacted with a strenuous statement of condemnation, registering North Korea's contravention of the resolution, demanding that North Korea return to multilateral talks aimed at denuclearization, and reminding all member states that they must comply with sanctions imposed on North Korea.  The UN Security Council also made clear that further action, in the form of a new resolution with stronger measures, was in the offing.Meanwhile, North Korea announced its withdrawal from the armistice that ended the Korean War. In response to North Korea's decision to return to nuclear activities, new United Nations Security Council sanctions were put forth, and the United States  said that it does not rule out returning North Korea to its list of terrorism sponsors.  Clearly, multilateral negotiations including North Korea, South Korea, China, Japan, Russia, and the United States stalled.In the second week of June 2009, Russian officials warned that North Korea was close to test-firing  another ballistic missile.  Around the same time, the United Nations Security Council  imposed harsh new sanctions against North Korea in response to the nuclear test carried out in May 2009.  For its part, North Korea reacted to these developments by threatening to weaponize its stocks of plutonium.On July 2, 2009, North Korea test-fired four short-range surface-to-ship missiles  were fired into the Sea of Japan, which South Korea regards as the ""East Sea.""  The missile tests were not surprising as Pyongyang issued warnings to shipping vessels, urging them to avoid coastal waters.  Two days later, North Korea was suspected of firing another seven ballistic missiles.  These seven  Scud-type missiles were launched from an east coast base and, as before, fell into the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea. The timing of the missile tests coincided with the United States' celebration of its  Independence Day on July 4, 2009, and was regarded as a clear act of defiance against Washington.  Nevertheless, the United States was joined by Russia and China in calling for calm.  Japan and South Korea said that the missile launches constituted  an ""act of provocation.""By the autumn of 2009, tensions had cooled and North Korea was indicating interest in returning to the negotiating table while the United States was saying that it welcomed dialogue to resolve differences on the nuclear issue. There remained disagreement about whether negotiations would take place within a multilateral framework between North Korea and United States, with the former party insisting on such a position, and the latter party giving no sign that it would pursue such a track.But by October 2009, North Korea had fired five short-range missiles into Sea of Japan (also known as the East Sea).  The surface-to-surface KN-02 missiles with a range of 75 miles  were launched south of Musudan-ri in the North Hamgyeong Province.  It was the first missile launches by North Korea and came at a time when hopes were rising about that country's  return to multilateral talks about its nuclear program.In early 2010, North Korea said that peace deal should be forged at the foundation for denuclearization talks.  It was not known how nuclear talks would be affected by the firing of artillery shells into theYellow Sea in late January 2010, or, the diplomatic breakdown following the destruction of a South Korean warship, reportedly by the North Koreans.By mid-2010, the United States had announced that it was imposing new sanctions against North Korea. The announcement by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton came in the aftermath of her visit to the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) that separates North Korea from South Korea. Secretary of State Clinton explained that the sanctions would target North Korea's sale and purchase of arms, and were aimed at preventing nuclear proliferation and discouraging provocative actions by North Korea. For its part, North Korea warned that fresh sanctions would be interpreted as an act of war.See ""Current Initiative"" and  ""Special Entry"" and ""Update"" below for further developments from late 2010 to 2013.Foreign Policy Positions of Key PlayersNorth Korea -After the Cold War, North Korea has felt a greater degree of insecurity because it is no longer has access to Soviet military aid. Thus, its nuclear program can be seen as a security investment. North Korea has also felt threatened by what it views as an aggressive U.S. foreign policy. Having been included in President Bush's ""axis of evil"" speech and having witnessed the policy of preemption implemented in Iraq, North Korea may view its nuclear program as a way to guard against a U.S. attack. Some observers, however, argue that North Korea's real agenda is to blackmail the international community into giving it the resources it needs to prevent economic collapse, thereby ensuring the regime's survival. North Korea has demanded that negotiations take place in a bilateral context with the U.S. In June 2006, the day after Washington announced that it would be willing to hold talks with Iran over its nuclear program, North Korea invited U.S. envoy Christopher Hill to Pyongyang. North Korea has stated that it will not participate in the six-party talks again until the U.S. removes financial sanctions currently in place against its counterfeiting and money laundering operations, which have caused banks around the world to avoid dealing with North Korea. North Korea also wants the U.S. to provide a light-water nuclear reactor before it dismantles its nuclear program. The September 2005 agreement only stated that the issue of the reactors would be addressed at an ""appropriate time."" In July 2006, North Korea caused an international stir when it test fired seven missiles, and again in October 2006, when it apparently joined the ""nuclear club.""  Ties with the broader international community deteriorated further as a result, however, progress on nuclear disarmament presented a significant shift from 2007 through 2008.  As noted here, since 2009, North Korea has moved from negotiations to confrontation.South Korea -Since 1998, South Korea has pursued a ""sunshine policy"" of diplomatic and economic engagement with North Korea. Although South Korea has reason to fear a nuclear-armed North Korea, it nonetheless aims to prevent the regime's collapse, which it believes would produce a flood of refugees across the border and destabilize the security of the region. As a result, South Korea has been reluctant to apply sanctions or cut off its economic aid. South Korea prefers a less confrontational and less coercive strategy that places an emphasis on business investment. South Korea currently operates industrial complexes inside North Korea that it hopes will demonstrate the benefits of economic liberalization. The U.S. opposes continued aid and investment because it does not feel that South Korea adequately links such economic benefits to North Korea's progress on human rights and nonproliferation. South Korea has offered the North large amounts of electricity as an incentive to disarm. Following the July 2006 missile tests, South Korea suspended its food aid to North Korea and said that it would only resume if North Korea made progress on the missile tests and nuclear issues.  South Korea welcomed the new sanctions against the North following the nuclear test of October 2006.Ties between North Korea and the  international community deteriorated further as a result, however, progress on nuclear disarmament presented a significant shift from 2007 through 2008.  As noted here, since 2009, North Korea has moved from negotiations to confrontation, which it blames to some degree on South Korea's new leader, who has taken a more hardline approach in dealing with the North.  See above for details.United States -The crux of U.S. strategy toward North Korea is to encourage North Korea's neighbors in the region to place pressure on the regime. The George W. Bush administration has remained largely skeptical of South Korea's sunshine policy and has argued that the Agreed Framework amounted to extortion. The Bush administration has demanded that North Korea completely abandon its nuclear program before it receives any concessions. The U.S. has also rejected North Korea's calls for direct bilateral negotiations, although informal discussions between the two countries have occurred on the sidelines of the six-party talks. The U.S. currently has sanctions in place against financial institutions who have dealings with North Korean companies suspected of counterfeiting U.S. currency and money laundering. In May 2006, there were rumors that the U.S. would be willing to pursue bilateral talks on the subject of a peace treaty to replace the 1953 armistice even while six-party negotiations were still ongoing.Ties between North Korea and the broader international community deteriorated further as a result of an October 2006 nuclear test, however, progress on nuclear disarmament presented a significant shift from 2007 through 2008.  As noted here, since 2009, North Korea has moved from negotiations to confrontation with the United States backing strong international action in response.China -As North Korea's only ally in the region, China possesses an enormous ability to influence North Korea's behavior as a result of the economic and energy assistance it provides. Like South Korea, however, even though it seeks to prevent North Korea from developing nuclear weapons, China is reluctant to put too harsh of penalties on North Korea for fear that the regime will collapse and destabilize the region. China worries that the North Korean program could spark a regional arms race. In addition, China fears that it could lose its influence on the peninsula if the regime were to collapse as a result of military action or sanctions, especially if the U.S. or South Korea took charge in the interim. During Chinese President Hu Jintao's April 2006 visit to the U.S., President Bush urged China to exercise its ""considerable influence"" over North Korea to coerce the country back to the bargaining table. China has repeatedly urged North Korea to reform its economy. Kim Jong-Il has made several trips to China to tour high-tech centers with the aim of learning how a communist country can liberalize its economy while still maintaining an authoritarian regime. In July 2006, China froze North Korean assets in its banks because North Korea continued to counterfeit Chinese currency.  Like Russia, China joined the condemnation of the nuclear test of October 2006, and did not veto the U.N. resolution endorsing financial and security sanctions against North Korea, although it lobbied for the exclusion of enforcement through military means.  Ties between North Korea and the broader international community deteriorated further as a result of the nuclear test, however, progress on nuclear disarmament, thanks to a Chinese-brokered initiative, presented a significant shift from 2007 through 2008.  As noted here, since 2009, North Korea has moved from negotiations to confrontation.  While China has, to date, been a strong ally of North Korea and has eschewed harsh responses from the international community, it has nonetheless issued strong condemnation of North Korea's latest (as of 2009) actions.Japan -Japan sees North Korea as a major security concern, especially after North Korea tested a long-range ballistic missile over Japan in 1998. Another major ongoing sticking point in Japanese-North Korea relations is the issue of North Korea's abduction of Japanese citizens in the 1970s and 1980s. However, despite Japan's security concerns, it has been willing to engage in talks with North Korea about normalizing relations. Japan has also expressed a willingness to provide a substantial aid package as part of a broader agreement in part to compensate for its actions during its colonial occupation of the Korean peninsula prior to 1945. In February 2006, North Korean and Japanese officials met for formal talks on the normalization of diplomatic relations, economic assistance, and the fate of Japan's kidnapped citizens. To a large extent, the U.S. and Japan share similar positions on the North Korean issue. Following the July 2006 missile tests, Japan requested an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council and encouraged its members to adopt a strong resolution condemning the tests and to apply sanctions.  Japan took a similar approach following the events of October 2006.  Ties between North Korea and the broader international community deteriorated further as a result of the test, however, progress in negotiations and denuclearization  presented a significant shift from 2007 through 2008.  As noted here, since 2009, North Korea has moved from negotiations to confrontation, resulting in condemnation from Japan, which backs international action in response.Russia -During the Cold War, the Soviet Union was one of North Korea's most significant allies, providing the regime with extensive military and economic aid. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia went to considerable lengths to downgrade its strategic relationship with North Korea as it sought economic ties with South Korea. Perhaps in an attempt to expand its influence in East Asia, Russia has been an eager participant in the six-party talks. Russia believes it should play a significant role in the negotiations because, unlike the U.S., Japan, and South Korea, it has normal diplomatic relations with both sides of the dispute. However, since Russia has ceased providing North Korea aid, its actual leverage over Pyongyang is arguably somewhat limited. China is a much more significant trading partner with North Korea. Russia, like China and South Korea, aims to prevent the collapse of the regime in the North because of fears of a mass exodus of refugees across the (short) Russian border. Russia is against applying sanctions toward North Korea, believing that sanctions will not change the regime's behavior nor achieve a negotiated settlement. Moscow has encouraged Washington to engage in direct talks with Pyongyang. Following the July 2006 missile tests, Russia expressed its disappointment, but said that the tests were within North Korea's legal rights.  Like China, Russia joined the condemnation of the nuclear test of October 2006, and did not veto the U.N. resolution endorsing financial and security sanctions against North Korea, although it lobbied for the exclusion of enforcement through military means.Ties between North Korea and the broader international community deteriorated further as a result of the nuclear test, however, progress on nuclear disarmament, thanks to a Chinese-brokered initiative, presented a significant shift from 2007 through 2008.  As noted here, since 2009, North Korea has moved from negotiations to confrontation.  While Russia has, to date, been a strong ally of North Korea and has eschewed harsh responses from the international community, it has nonetheless issued strong condemnation of North Korea's latest  actions.Past InitiativesIn 1992, North and South Korea issued the Joint Declaration on the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula in which both countries pledged not to ""test, manufacture, produce, receive, possess, store, deploy or use nuclear weapons."" In response, the U.S. removed its tactical nuclear weapons from South Korea. The Joint Declaration was supposed to set up an inspections regime to monitor the compliance of both sides with regards to nuclear weapons. However, the declaration failed to end the nuclear dispute because North Korea denied International Atomic Energy Ahency (IAEA) inspectors access to some of its nuclear facilities, fueling more suspicions in the international community. The IAEA subsequently censured North Korea and referred the issue to the U.N. Security Council, which passed a resolution demanding North Korea's compliance. After North Korea rejected the Security Council's resolution, it banned IAEA inspectors from its facilities and announced its intention to withdraw from the NPT. Meanwhile, the U.S. formulated plans for a military strike against North Korea's nuclear reactor in Yongbyon, where the U.S. believed North Korea was reprocessing enough plutonium to make several bombs. North Korea then agreed to negotiate greater access for IAEA inspectors.In 1994, the U.S. and North Korea signed the Agreed Framework. Under the terms of the Framework, North Korea agreed to give up its plutonium program and allow IAEA inspections of its facilities in return for a package of incentives that included normalized diplomatic and economic relations with the U.S. The plan was to be administered by the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO), an international consortium funded by the U.S., Japan, and South Korea tasked with constructing two light-water nuclear reactors and providing fuel shipments to meet North Korea's energy needs.The implementation process for the Agreed Framework was delayed from the outset. North Korea soon insisted that the nuclear reactors it was promised in the agreement not come officially from South Korea, which caused a delay as KEDO sought downplay South Korea' role. In 1996, a North Korean submarine with 25 commandos came aground in South Korea. All were killed by each other or by South Korean forces. As a result, South Korea temporarily suspended its participation in the Agreed Framework. The U.S. also began to suspect that North Korea was developing an underground nuclear site in the late 1990s. In August 1998, North Korea tested its Taepodong-1 medium-range missile over Japan, sparking an international outcry. These incidents led the Clinton administration to delay lifting economic sanctions on North Korea as called for in the Agreed Framework. North Korea used these delays as proof that it was not the first party to violate the terms of the Agreed Framework.In 2002, the U.S. confronted North Korea with evidence of a secret uranium enrichment program. North Korea acknowledged the existence of the program, which was in violation of its obligations under the NPT, the 1992 declaration, and the Agreed Framework. At first North Korea defended its right to have nuclear weapons, but then offered to dismantle its program in exchange for non-aggression pact by the U.S. North Korea charged that the U.S. had violated the terms of the Agreed Framework, as the two light-water nuclear reactors under construction were years behind schedule. North Korea then restarted operations at its nuclear reactor in Yongbyon and subsequently withdrew from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and expelled IAEA inspectors. The KEDO executive board voted to suspend heavy fuel shipments and halt construction on the light-water reactors until the nuclear issue was satisfactorily resolved.Current Initiative: Six-Party TalksSince August 2003, the current negotiations about North Korea's nuclear program have taken place in the context of the six-party talks in Beijing. Thus far, there have been five rounds of negotiations. The first round in August 2003 failed to resolve the issue, although the delegates agreed to meet again. The second round began in February 2004 and also ended without an agreement. In June 2004, the third round began, this time with the U.S. offering to provide fuel to North Korea in return for disarmament. On February 2005, North Korea announced that it possessed nuclear weapons and stated it had no intention of continuing to participate in the six-party talks. In July 2005, North Korea agreed to return to the talks. In August 2005, no agreement had been made and the talks adjourned for a recess until the following month.In September 2005 the negotiations yielded a provisional agreement in which North Korea pledged to dismantle its nuclear program and rejoin the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. In return, the other countries offered North Korea a package of economic, diplomatic, and security incentives, including a non-aggression pledge by the U.S. However, the agreement did not specify whether North Korea needed to do this before or after it received its package of incentives. In order to achieve a preliminary agreement and break the impasse, the countries that signed the agreement each released statements describing their respective understandings of the accord. North Korea subsequently claimed that it was under no obligation to dismantle its nuclear program or rejoin the NPT until it received the light-water reactors it had been promised under the Agreed Framework. The U.S., however, flatly refused to grant North Korea any such concessions until it completely dismantled its nuclear program, rejoined the NPT, and allowed for IAEA inspections.In November 2005, the fifth round of six-party talks began. The U.S. and North Korea were unable to come to an agreement about what the terms of the September 20005 accord actually required of each party. North Korea's has refused to participate in any more talks until the U.S. removes financial measures in place designed to sanction North Korea for its involvement in money laundering and counterfeiting.After weeks of speculation, North Korea test fired at least seven short-, medium-, and long-range missiles in July 2006. Though the tests appear to have failed, they nonetheless provoked international condemnation. In mid-July, the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution condemning North Korea for testing the missiles and demanded that it cease activities related to its ballistic missile program. The resolution also prohibits U.N. members from providing North Korea with missile-related goods and technology. The resolution passed unanimously only after a reference to Chapter Seven of the U.N. charter, which would have authorized sanctions or military action and would have been legally binding, was removed. Russia and China had opposed binding sanctions. The resolution also urged North Korea to return to the six-party immediately and without preconditions. North Korea rejected the resolution.High-level talks between North and South Korean officials were cancelled as a result of the missile tests. South Korea suspended its shipments of food aid to the north, stating that they would not resume until North Korea made progress on the issues of the missile tests and its nuclear program. North Korea responded by suspending the visits of families separated across the DMZ. North Korea also cancelled plans to host a joint celebration of the anniversary of the Korean peninsula's liberation from Japanese rule.Also in July 2006, China froze North Korean assets in the Bank of China because North Korea continued to counterfeit Chinese currency. The move was tantamount to imposing economic sanctions on the regime, which China had previously not been willing to do.U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice expressed hope that the six-party talks would reconvene on the sidelines of an Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Regional Forum meeting in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in late July 2006. When North Korea again refused to participate until the U.S. lifted its financial sanctions, the other five countries involved in the six-party talks, in addition to Malaysia, Canada, and Australia, met to discuss the issue on the sidelines of the ASEAN Regional Forum meeting.In October 2006, North Korea said that it intended to test a nuclear weapon.  The international community, including China, strenuously urged North Korea not to do so.  Nevertheless, North Korea carried out an apparent test of a nuclear weapon. The international community responded to North Korea's announcement with widespread condemnation and a punitive U.N. Security Council resolution endorsing financial and security sanctions.  Resolution  1718 called for  the inspections on cargo going to and from North Korea to search for weapons, a ban on the sale or transfer of materials related to North Korea's unconventional weapons program, and a freeze on the transfer of funds connected with North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.  Absent from Resolution 1718 was the Chapter Seven [of the United Nations charter] provision, which would enforce the sanctions via military force. North Korea was also urged to return to multilateral talks.For its part, however, the North Korean government in Pyongyang decried Resolution 1718,  and warned that subsequent pressure by the United States would be regarded as  ""a declaration of war.""December 2006 marked the resumption of multilateral talks regarding North Korea's controversial nuclear program.  North Korea, South Korea, China, Japan, Russia and the United States indicated their return to the negotiating table after a year-long hiatus. While the news of the recommencement of  six-party talks was welcomed, there was also a pervasive sense of caution. Experts conveyed limited optimism about the prospects of forging a resolution amenable to all parties. Indeed, the United States has consistently expressed vociferous opposition to the notion of North Korea being a nuclear power, while North Korea has been equally adamant about its need for nuclear weapons.  These two absolutist positions have resulted in an impasse.  The December 2006 talks ended inconclusively and multilateral talks resumed again in January 2007.By February 2007, the multilateral discussions saw some progress.  Of particular interest was an agreement  reportedly requiring Pyongyang to shut down its nuclear facilities  at Yongbyon over the course of the ensuing months, in lieu of aid, such as fuel oil provided by the United States and South Korea.  The draft agreement, which had been drafted by Chinese,  also called for the return of international inspectors to North Korea. No concurrence was yet forged days after talks began.On February 13, 2007, it was announced that concurrence had been reached.  North Korea agreed to shut down its nuclear facilities at Yongbyon within 60 days in exchange for 50,000 tonnes of fuel oil or economic aid of equal value, with 950,000 tonnes of fuel oil or equivalent received after further disarmament steps are taken.As well, both Japan and the United States agreed to discuss the possibility of normalizing ties with North Korea -- something that Pyongyang has been seeking for some time.The United States also said that it would work with North Korea to resolve a banking dispute, and it would consider the prospects of removing North Korea from its list of state sponsors of terrorism.Yet to be seen was whether or not the agreement would be ratified by all six parties, and also whether or not North Korea would fully comply with the provisions of the deal.  For example, the state news agency of North Korea issued a report referring to the ""temporary"" suspension of nuclear activities, rather than enduring disarmament.  United States negotiator, Christopher Hill, warned that the resumption of nuclear activities in the future would be a clear violation of the agreement.In the third week of June 2007, North Korea reportedly agreed to shut down its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon and, then, disable its nuclear facilities.  North Korea also noted that it was inviting International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors to return to North Korea to monitor the closure of its nuclear program and facilities.  To that end, IAEA inspectors were expected to visit North Korea on June 26, 2007, for the first time since their dismissal from that country in 2002.These announcements came months after the aforementoned Chinese drafted an agreement in February 2007 in which the closure of the reactor at Yongbyon would be secured, in lieu of one million metric tons of heavy fuel oil that would be secured by other countries  participating in the multilateral nuclear disarmament talks.The total amount of fuel oil appeared to more substantial that the original quantity discussed earlier in the year under the Chinese-brokered plan.In addition, diplomatic recognition and humanitarian aid benefits were included in the deal.  These perks included possible normalization of ties between North Korea and Japan and the United States respectively, as well as the removal of North Korea from the United States' list of state sponsors of terrorism.Also included in the arrangement was the untangling of financial dispute.  At issue has been several millions of dollars, which were frozen in a bank in the Chinese domain of Macao in 2005, after the United States claimed that the funds had been acquired through illicit means.  The move resulted in several banks refusing to do business with North Korea out of fear of similar action being taken.  As such, North Korea had been adamant about linking satisfactory resolution of the financial dispute with the aforementioned nuclear disarmament agreement.  With the deal now moving forward, North Korea said that it would begin the process of shutting down operations at Yongbyon within weeks, pending receipt of the frozen funds. Russia, which worked to facilitate the complex transfer, said that the money was in the process of being delivered.North Korea characterized talks with United States nuclear envoy, Christopher Hill, on these matter as being both  ""comprehensive and productive.""  Hill responded to the developments positively but noted that the closure of the reactor at Yongbyon was only the start of an ongoing process, and would not solve all the problems at hand. Hill also said that a new round of six-party disarmament talks, which has included North Korea, South Korea, China, Japan, Russia and the United States, would commence in July 2007.In mid-July 2007, North Korea said that it shut down its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon.  A team of inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was monitoring the situation at Yongbyon in order to verify Pyongyang's claim.  Nevertheless, the announcement was welcomed by the countries of the West, the wider world, and particularly by the countries participating in multilateral talks with North Korea aimed at disarmament.In October 2007, North Korea said that it would end its nuclear ambitions.  To that end, Pyongyang formally agreed to a timetable for the disabling of its nuclear facilities.Pyongyang also agreed to disclose details about its nuclear program by the close of 2007. North Korea was scheduled to surrender its stockpile of nuclear weaponry in 2008.In October 2008, the United States removed North Korea from its list of terrorism sponsors as part of the denuclearization agreement.At the end of 2008, it was clear that North Korea;s disarmament progress had stalled.  Then at the start of 2009, the United States reacted by suspending energy aid to North Korea. Soon thereafter, relations devolved between the two Koreas when the South Korean leader said that aid to the North would be dependent on that country's willingness to completely end its nuclear weapons program. North Korea accused South Korea of hostile intent and announced it was ending all political and military agreements with its neighbor to the south.April 2009 saw North Korea take provocative action by launching a communications satellite into space via rocket.  That claim was widely viewed as obfuscation of a missile test.On May 25, 2009, less than three years after the earlier underground nuclear test, North Korea conducted a second such test, arguing the merits of its right to a military deterrent. Days later, North Korea announced its withdrawal from the armistice that ended the Korean War.  Meanwhile, multilateral negotiations including North Korea, South Korea, China, Japan, Russia, and the United States have remained stalled.See ""Special Entry""  and ""Update"" below for more details on the most recent developments related to North Korea's nuclear program.***Special Entry:North Korea conducts nuclear test in violation of UN Security Resolution 1718 and announces end of armistice; UN issues condemnation and a harsh sanctions regimeOn May 25, 2009, North Korea said that it had successfully conducted an underground nuclear test.  North Korea said that this test contained more explosive power than an earlier nuclear test conducted in 2006.Several independent entities confirmed that a powerful explosion had been registered,  resulting in the conclusion that it was caused by the nuclear test.  Indeed, the United States Geological Survey said that a 4.7 magnitude seismic tremor was detected underground and indicated a nuclear explosion of some kind.As well, the Russian Defense Ministry was also reported to have said it detected the explosion.  The actual location of the testing was unknown but South Korea noted that a seismic tremor had been detected in the north-eastern part of the country close to Kilju.  This was the area where North Korea's first nuclear test had been conducted.Geopolitical analysts were trying to determine why North Korea had chosen to move from negotiations to a clearly confrontational stance.  Two years earlier, North Korea agreed to close its nuclear facility at Yongbyong and comply with international monitoring of its nuclear assets.  In exchange, it was to be the recipient of a generous aid package.Later, however, North Korea withdrew from long-running multilateral negotiations and stopped inspectors from monitoring  progress related to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.There was some speculation that after a woeful harvest, with up to a quarter of the North Korean population in desperate need of food aid, according to the World Food Programme, Pyongyang may have been trying to divert attention from this internal crisis.  There was also some suggestion that the domestic worries may have prompted an internal power struggle, which ultimately may have spurred this action by hard-liner within the regime.For its part, Pyongyang appeared to indicate its motive via a communique announced on state radio, which asserted that the underground nuclear testing had been ""successfully conducted... as part of measures to enhance the Republic's self-defensive nuclear deterrent in all directions.""  The statement went on to note that the test was intended to ""contribute to safeguard the sovereignty of the country and the nation and socialism.""  Pyongyang also offered assurances that the underground nuclear testing had ensued in a safe manner with advanced technology.International news agencies reported that in addition to the underground nuclear test, North Korea also test-fired two short-range missiles.  There were reports that the test firing of these missiles was aimed at disrupting the ability of United States' surveillance of the nuclear testing.The international community reacted with outrage and condemnation to these collective actions, which occurred  just a month after North Korea test fired a long-range missile capable of reaching Asia as well as parts of the United States.Crisis talks were convened by Japan and South Korea respectively.  A spokesman for South Korean President Lee Myung-bak said that North Korea's decision to conduct nuclear testing  was a ""grave challenge"" to international non-proliferation efforts.  Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Takeo Kawamura deemed the path embarked on by North  as ""unacceptable.""United States President Barack Obama said that the action by North Korea was a threat to international peace and stability.  He warned, ""The danger posed by North Korea's threatening activities warrants action by the international community.""  The American president observed that North Korea was ""not only deepening its own isolation it's also inviting stronger international pressure.""United Kingdom Prime Minister Gordon Brown said North Korea's nuclear activities ""undermine prospects for peace on the Korean peninsula.""One of North Korea's closest allies, China, joined the wider international realm in decrying the nuclear testing.  The Chinese Foreign Ministry issued a statement that read: ""China expresses a resolute protest against new nuclear weapons tests carried out by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, in defiance of the objections voiced by the world community.""  The Chinese government also demanded that North Korea to honor its obligations related to denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.  At the wider level China  called for peaceful and calm dialogue to resolve the burgeoning crisis.Another of North Korea's closest allies, Russia, closed ranks with Western powers in denouncing North Korea's actions.  The chairman of the State Duma Defense Committee, Viktor Zavarzin, echoed the words of United States President Obama.  Zavarzin said, ""The actions of the North Korean leadership can be described as threatening international peace and security. The whole world community should be involved in resolving this problem, in particular within the framework of the UN Security Council.""Russia, which was at the helm of the rotating presidency, called for an emergency session of the United Nations (UN) Security Council, noting that North Korea had violated UN Security Council Resolution 1718.In fact, the Russian Foreign Ministry categorically rebuked North Korea's actions in a statement that read: ""We cannot describe the North Korean move other than as a breach of UN Security Council resolution 1718, which prohibits Pyongyang from carrying out nuclear tests.""  The statement continued, ""The North Korean nuclear test has a serious impact on international efforts aiming to strengthen the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and breaches the international regime provided by the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.""Indeed, UN Security Council Resolution 1718 exists in tandem with Article 41 of Chapter VII of the UN Charter and compels compliance by all member states.  A nuclear test would be an unassailable violation of UN Security Resolution 1718, which itself imposed sanctions in North Korea after it conducted a previous test in 2006.Not surprisingly, the UN Security Council rapidly reacted with a strenuous statement of condemnation, registering North Korea's contravention of the resolution, demanding that North Korea return to multilateral talks aimed at denuclearization, and reminding all member states that they must comply  with sanctions imposed on North Korea.  The UN Security Council also made clear that further action, in the form of a new resolution with stronger measures, was in the offing.After the emergency meeting of the UN Security Council, Vitaly Churkin -- Russian envoy to the UN and the current president of the body -- made clear that work on the new resolution would start immediately.  He said, ""The members of the Security Council have decided to start work immediately on a Security Council resolution on this matter, in accordance with the Security Council's responsibilities under the Charter of the United Nations.""United States Ambassador to the UN, Susan Rice, also said that the formulation of a new resolution with more stringent measures would commence right away.  Rice said, ""The US thinks that this is a grave violation of international law and a threat to regional and international peace and security. And therefore the United States will seek a strong resolution with strong measures.""On May 27, 2009, the North Korean military announced that it was abandoning the armistice that brought an end to Korean War.The North Korean military said that this action was being taken in response to South Korea's decision to participate in  the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI).  North Korea said that South Korea's decision to join PSI --  a United States-led effort to patrol the oceans in search of nuclear weapons -- was tantamount to a ""declaration of war"" and promised military action if its shipping vessels were intercepted.  In another development, South Korean media reported that steam had been observed emanating from North Korea's nuclear plant at Yongbyon -- a sign indicating North Korea had decided to recommence the manufacture of weapons-grade plutonium.By the end of the month, North Korea had fired a total of six short-range missiles and United States military officials warned that further missile launches were likely in the works.  Military officials in Washington D.C. said that satellite photographs indicated activity at a facility from which North Korea has in the past fired long-range missiles.  Meanwhile, with the UN Security Council contemplating action in response to North Korea's nuclear test days earlier, Pyongyang warned that it could take ""self defense"" actions if sanctions were imposed.In the first week of June 2009, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that North Korea could well be reinstated on her country's list of countries viewed as sponsors of terrorism.  With some politicians in the United States calling for such a response, the country's top diplomat said, ""Well, we're going to look at it. There's a process for it. Obviously we would want to see recent evidence of their support for international terrorism.""North Korea was removed from the terror list in October 2008 when it was compliant with a denuclearization agreement brokered via multilateral talks.  But North Korea's recent decisions to pursue nuclear activities, manifest most blatantly in an underground nuclear test, as well as a volley of short-range missile tests, have rendered that agreement functionally void.Secretary of State Clinton observed, ""Obviously they were taken off of the list for a purpose and that purpose is being thwarted by their actions.""Secretary of State Clinton also warned that North Korea was likely to face harsh consequences from the United Nations, as the international body contemplated a new resolution against North Korea.  To that end, Clinton said, ""  We think we're going to come out of this with a very strong resolution with teeth that will have consequences for the North Korean regime.""  She continued, ""If we do not take significant and effective action against the North Koreans now, we'll spark an arms race in North-East Asia.""In the second week of June 2009, Russian officials warned that North Korea was close to test-firing  another ballistic missile.  The Russian military reportedly claimed that it had accessed information pertaining to the type of rocker to be launched although it was unaware of a specific launch date.  This claim was somewhat supported by reports that North Korea warned shipping vessels to stay away from its east coast waters for a period for three weeks.Meanwhile, the United States special envoy to North Korea, Stephen Bosworth, said in an address to the Korea Society in New York that his government was considering stronger responses to the challenges posed by North Korea's recent missile activities.  He said, ""North Korea's recent actions to develop a nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile capacity require that we expand our consideration of new responses.""  He continued, ""However, the North Korean claim to be responding to a 'threat' or a 'hostile policy' by the United States is simply groundless. Quite to the contrary, we have no intention to invade North Korea or change its regime through force, and this has been made clear to the DPRK repeatedly.""Among the possible responses being considered by the United States were financial sanctions, as well as tougher inspections of shipping vessels in waters surrounding North Korea.  Related to these possible moves was the unanimous decision by the United Nations Security Council to impose harsh new sanctions against North Korea in response to the nuclear test carried out in May 2009.  Included in the new sanctions regime was the expected provision for the increased inspection of North Korean cargo not only on shipping vessels, but also on land and by air, and it authorized the destruction of any materials suspected of being linked to weapons of mass destruction. The new sanctions regime also expanded the arms embargo against North Korea, effectively prohibiting the sale of heavy and small arms by North Korea.Rosemary DiCarlo, the United States deputy ambassador at the United Nations said: ""North Korea chose a path of provocation. This resolution will give us new tools to impair North Korea's ability to proliferate, and to threaten international stability.""  In a rare show of solidarity with the international powers against North Korea, China said the measures showed that the world opposed Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions.  Indeed, Chinese ambassador Zhang Yesui said: ""We strongly urge the DPRK (North Korea) to honor its commitment to de-nuclearization, stop any moves that may further worsen the situation, and return to the six-party talks.""  He also rebuked North Korea for jeopardizing regional security by carrying out the nuclear test.For its part, North Korea reacted to these developments by threatening to weaponize its stocks of plutonium.  United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that this threat by Pyongyang was both ""provocative"" and ""deeply regrettable.""  She warned that the move would serve only to isolate North Korea even further from the wider international community.By the third week of June 2009,  reports emerged about a long range missile launch by North Korea -- quite possibly in the direction of Hawaii. United States President Barack Obama said in an interview with CBS News: ""This administration - and our military - is fully prepared for any contingencies.""The American president dismissed the notion that it was warning of a military response against North Korea.  But he also said, ""I don't want to speculate on hypotheticals.  But I do want to give assurances to the American people that the T's are crossed and the I's are dotted.""In other developments, United States President Barack Obama  renewed his country's sanctions -- separate from the United Nations sanctions -- against North Korea.  President Obama explained that North Korea's nuclear development combined with threats posed a national security risk to the United States and destabilized the region of eastern Asia. The American president also said his administration would end the cycle of responding to North Korean nuclear threats by granting concessions and incentives to Pyongyang.Around the same time, the United States, North Korea's neighbors and the wider international community were all  bracing for a possible missile launch by Pyongyang in the direction of Hawaii -- a presumed act of retaliation for the new sanctions.  Earlier, President Obama had said that the United States military was prepared to deal with any of contingencies posed by  a possible North Korean missile launch.On July 2, 2009, North Korea test-fired four short-range missiles.  According to South Korea's Yonhap News Agency,  two surface-to-ship missiles had been fired from the port of Wonsan while the other two were launched  from Sinsang-ni.  All four were fired into the Sea of Japan, which South Korea regards as the ""East Sea.""  The missile tests were not surprising as Pyongyang issued warnings to shipping vessels, urging them to avoid coastal waters.  Two days later, North Korea was suspected of firing another seven ballistic missiles.  These seven  Scud-type missiles were launched from an east coast base and, as before, fell into the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea.The timing of the missile tests coincided with the United States' celebration of its  Independence Day on July 4, 2009, and was regarded as a clear act of defiance against Washington.  Nevertheless, the United States was joined by Russia and China in calling for calm.  Russia and China urged North Korea to return to the negotiating table and said all parties should work to avoid further destabilization of the region.  The United States also said that the tense situation should not be exacerbated. Using highly restrained language, a United States Department of State official said the volley of missile tests were ""not helpful"" and said that North Korea should not ""aggravate tensions"" but instead ""focus on denuclearization talks.""  While British Foreign Secretary David Miliband echoed this sentiment by saying that tensions on the Korean peninsula should remain ""at manageable levels,"" Japan and South Korea struck a somewhat harsher tone in saying that the missile launches constituted  an ""act of provocation.""Later in August 2009, North Korea deployed envoys to the United States to meet with New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson.  The seasoned diplomat, Richardson,  served as United Nations ambassador and Energy Secretary under the Clinton administration in the 1990s, and was responsible for helping to broker an agreement with the North Koreans that brought a temporary end to its nuclear development.Following his meeting with the North Koreans, Governor Richardson, a Democrat who endorsed Barack Obama for president, said that believed that Pyongyang had issued ""good signals"" that pointed toward the restarting of dialogue with Washington.  Indeed, multilateral talks on North Korea's controversial nuclear program had stalled in recent times, and relations became increasingly strained after North Korea went forward with an underground nuclear, followed by a succession of missile tests.  Now, however, in the aftermath of a successful but unofficial trip by former President Bill Clinton to North Korea to secure the release of two American journalists, Governor Richardson said that he believed the climate had improved.  Indeed, Governor Richardson said that he indicated a ""thaw"" in relations and believed that North Korea was ""ready for a new dialogue with the United States regarding the nuclear issue.""That said, an actual diplomatic breakthrough was still in the offing. According to Governor Richardson, North Korea remained intransigent on the issue of returning to six-party talks. Instead,  Pyongyang believed that it had earned some goodwill and wanted to pursue direct bilateral talks with the United States.  To this end, Governor Richardson said that Pyongyang had ""obviously used the journalists as a bargaining chip"" and was looking for a reciprocal  a ""gesture"" from Washington.The Obama administration has indicated that while it was willing to return to the negotiating table with North Korea within the multilateral framework, with an eye on irreversible denuclearization, it would not soon engage in direct talks.  State Department spokesman, Ian Kelly, said:  ""Our goal is the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. And, of course, we want to see progress toward that.""After the meeting between the Governor Richardson and the North Korean envoys, North Korea invited the United States envoy to North Korea, Stephen Bosworth, for direct negotiations on its nuclear program.  South Korea media reported that there were rumblings about the White House giving serious consideration to the idea of actually sending Bosworth to North Korea. But on the record, the United States embassy in Seoul would offer no comment on the matter.On  October 12, 2009, North Korea fires five short-range missiles into Sea of Japan (also known as the East Sea).  The surface-to-surface KN-02 missiles with a range of 75 miles  were launched south of Musudan-ri in the North Hamgyeong Province.  As a precaution, North Korea had banned shipping vessels from the waters off the east and west coasts from October 10 to October 20, 2009, according to the Yonhap news agency.  It was the first missile launches by North Korea  in several months  and came after North Korea said that it was willing to return to multilateral talks about its nuclear program.On Dec. 12, 2009, Thailand seized a cargo plane that was said to be carrying 40 tons of weapons from North Korea to an unknown destination. The chartered Soviet-designed Il-76 aircraft, which originated in the North Korean capital city of Pyongyang,  was refueling at the Bangkok airport when it was intercepted by the Thai military. The ensuing raid of the aircraft resulted in the uncovering of missiles, rocket-propelled grenades and other weapons.  As well, five crew members -- four from Kazakhstan and one from Belarus -- were detained and taken into Thai custody. The Thai authorities said they were acting as a result of a tip from foreign intelligence.  Reuters reported that the source was actually United States intelligence, based on information supplied by an anonymous source.  Reuters quoted that anonymous source as saying: ""It [the plane] came from North Korea and was heading for somewhere in South Asia, probably Pakistan.""While another news report stated the aircraft was headed on to Sri Lanka, geopolitical analysts suggested that the Indian Ocean island might not have been the ultimate destination.Thai Deputy Prime Minister Suthep Thaungsuban confirmed that the weapons had been found aboard the aircraft and that a transparent investigation was in the offing. Indeed, such an investigation was likely to have international effects since the United Nations increased sanctions against North Korea earlier in the year in response to controversial nuclear testing.  Those sanctions expressly addressed the transshipment of weaponry.  But impoverished North Korea derives much of its revenue from arms sales to countries in the Middle East.UpdateBy early 2010, North Korea indicated that part of the new phase of negotiations on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula should include a new peace treaty to replace the armistice that ended the Korean War.  North Korea said that a peace agreement should form the fulcrum of  negotiations on this matter and should be addressed prior to the return to six-party talks aimed at ending Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program, or, as a central part of those multilateral negotiations.  In a statement published by North Korea's state-run news agency, the North Korean Foreign Ministry said: ""If a peace treaty is signed, it will help resolve hostile relations between North Korea and the United States and speed up the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.""  North Korea also called for an end to the United Nations sanctions, which were  imposed after it conducted  nuclear and ballistic missile tests in 2009.  North Korean officials said that its return to the negotiating table was contingent upon the lifting of those sanctions.On January 29, 2010, North Korea reportedly fired artillery shells in the area of the Yellow Sea, close to the country's  maritime border with South Korea.  It was third day that North Korea had carried out such action, according to the South Korean military.  Speculation abounded that the provocative action by North Korea may have been aimed at forcing the United States and South Korea to respond to its proposal for a peace treaty to officially end the Korean War, which has effectively ceased via a prevailing armistice rather than an actual peace agreement.  North Korea has argued that it cannot advance further denuclearization talks without the foundation of a peace treaty.In June 2010, South Korea had referred North Korea to the United Nations over the matter of a torpedoed warship. At issue was the sinking of its Cheonan warship months earlier, which an international investigation ultimately blamed on North Korea despite Pyongyang's denial of culpability.In the third week of July 2010, the United States (U.S.) announced that it was imposing new sanctions against North Korea. The announcement by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton came in the aftermath of her visit to the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) that separates North Korea from South Korea. Secretary of State Clinton explained that the sanctions would target North Korea's sale and purchase of arms, and were aimed at preventing nuclear proliferation and discouraging provocative actions by North Korea.As one the most sanctioned countries in the world, these new sanctions were likely intended to intensify the pressure on North Korea in response to the Cheonan incident. In fact, as indicated by Secretary of State Clinton, they were aimed at compelling Pyongyang to take responsibility for the sinking of the warship that left 47 dead. For its part, North Korea warned that fresh sanctions would be interpreted as an act of war.In late October 2010, North Korean and South Korean troops exchanged fire across the border. According to accounts from authorities in Seoul, North Korean troops fired two rounds in the direction of a front line unit at Hwacheon, prompting South Korean troops to return fire. No further exchange of fire followed the incident and there were no injuries to South Korean troops. There was no consensus as to whether or not North Korea's actions constituted a direct provocation.  Only days later on November 3, 2010, South Korea's navy fired warning shots at a North Korean fishing vessel in  maritime border waters.In the last week of November 2010, an exchange of fire occurred between North Korean and South Korean forces, leaving two South Korean marines dead, 16 other South Korean marines injured, and three civilians wounded.  At issue was the shelling of the inhabited Yeonpyeong Island by North Korea, located in close proximity the disputed  Yellow Sea maritime border, just off the North Korean coast.  South Korea, whose military was conducting military exercises in the waters off Yeonpyeong Island, reportedly  returned fire, spurring one of the most serious clashes between the North and the South since the Korean War.  Some fifty shells reportedly landed on the island, largely hitting a South Korean military base in the area.  South Korea returned a fire with about 80 shells; the casualties on the north side of the border were not known.South Korean President Lee Myung-bak convened  a meeting of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the capital city of Seoul.  Following the meeting, he announced that the South Korean military would punish North Korea for its attack, adding that it was vital that Pyongyang not engage in further provocation.For its part, Pyongyang placed the blame on South Korea for igniting the clashes. It should be noted that Seoul disputes the North Korean version of the events that transpired. Nevertheless, according to the state-run KCNA news agency, ""The South Korean enemy, despite our repeated warnings, committed reckless military provocations of firing artillery shells into our maritime territory near Yeonpyeong Island.""  The North, therefore, was prepared to strike back if South Korea ""dares to invade our sea territory.""United States President Barack Obama characterized the incident an ""outrageous, provocative act"" by North Korea. Russia struck a similar tone with Russian  Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warning of a ""colossal danger""  and characterizing those responsible for the clashes as carrying a huge responsibility.  The European Union also added its voice to the litany of condemnations. Japanese Prime Minister, Naoto Kan, took a defensive stance in the national interests of his country, saying that his government had to prepare for the occurrence of ""any unexpected event.""But China, North Korea's closest ally, offered a murky suggestion that the two Koreas should ""do more to contribute to peace.""  A spokesperson for the Chinese government also called for restarting  six-party negotiations on North Korea's nuclear program -- a prospect that seemed practically unlikely, given these latest developments.  Indeed, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency, President Lee Myung-bak was reported to have informed a visiting Chinese foreign policy adviser, Dai Bingguo, that his country (South Korea) was not interested in the resumption of the multilateral nuclear talks; the South Korean leader apparently emphasized the importance of immediately dealing with North Korea's aggressive actions of late.In another development, South Korean Defense Minister Kim Tae-young came under fire for ignoring intelligence reports that alerted his country of possible attacks from the North, as well as the country's slow and weak responses to the threat posed by Pyongyang.  Perhaps not surprisingly, he was forced to resign from his post.To date, there have been occasional flare ups in the border regions since the Korean War ended without a  peace treaty in 1953.  However, the attack on Yeonpyeong Island  occurred at a time of increased tensions between the two Koreas. Months earlier in March 2010, as discussed above, South Korea accused North Korea of torpedoing one of its warships  in the area of the western maritime border, also known as the Northern Limit Line. For its part, North Korea has denied that charge and has also insisted that South Korea engage in diplomatic talks with Pyongyang aimed at easing tensions, or, deal with ""catastrophic"" consequences. Then, in late October 2010, as discussed above, North Korean and South Korean troops exchanged fire across the border. According to accounts from authorities in Seoul, North Korean troops fired two rounds in the direction of a front line unit at Hwacheon, prompting South Korean troops to return fire. No further exchange of fire followed the incident and there were no injuries to South Korean troops. There was no consensus as to whether or not North Korea's actions constituted a direct provocation. Only days later on November 3, 2010, South Korea's navy fired warning shots at a North Korean fishing vessel in maritime border waters.At the time, South Korea  sought to downplay the incidences or the prospects of trouble emanating from the North. Indeed, during a news conference focused on an impending summit in Seoul, South Korean President Lee Myung-bak had said, ""I don't think the North will try to do anything when leaders of the international community are meeting to discuss the world economy."" He continued, ""I trust the North won't do anything but still we are fully prepared.""On the other side of the border, while North Korea has a history of making provocative moves, many analysts said that it was unlikely that Pyongyang would seek to alienate the international community, especially at a time when it has been revealing its new leadership succession team to the world. Earlier, President Kim Jong-il's son was given a military promotion, and sanctioned as the likely successor to the ailing leader. Of course, as illustrated by the events in late November 2010 on Yeonpyeong Island, it was apparent that the path of provocation was the one being traversed by North Korea.Attention was on the matter of why North Korea would seek to heighten the state of volatility on the Korean Peninsula.  Perhaps, for North Korea, this is a simple matter of defending its interests.  However, it could well be that the aforementioned analysts interpreted the matter of leadership transition incorrectly.  It could well be that North Korea is not concerned with the matter of alienating the international community. Instead, at this time of leadership transition from ailing President Kim Jong-il to his son, the priority from Pyongyang is to establish North Korea's power, and to show the military elite in North Korea that the named successor is not afraid to embrace a muscular stance in relation to the South, and indeed, the world.The situation on the Korean peninsula has been made more complicated by the November 2010 revelation that North Korea constructed a  new nuclear facility. A nuclear scientist from Stanford University in the United States, Dr. Siegfried Hecker, said that during a visit to North Korea, he was shown a new nuclear facility.  There -- at the new nuclear facility at the Yongbyon nuclear complex to the north of the capital of Pyongyang -- he viewed ""more than 1,000 centrifuges"" for enriching uranium -- elements needed for the production of nuclear weapons.Since  the nuclear facility did not exist when international nuclear weapons inspectors were expelled from North Korea in 2009, it was clear that it had been constructed quickly.  But Dr. Hecker noted that the facility boasted a high level of sophistication, and as reported in the New York Times, it included an ""ultra-modern control room.""  According to Dr. Hecker, the facility appeared oriented for the use of civilian nuclear power.  Noting that there was no sign of plutonium production, which is needed for weapons proliferation, Dr. Hecker nonetheless cautioned in an interview with the Associated Press that the new facility could be ""readily converted to produce highly enriched uranium bomb fuel.""Dr. Hecker additionally  shored up previous reports that North Korea has been constructing a light-water nuclear  reactor.  His observations on the ground in North Korea appeared to coincide with satellite imagery depicting the construction of the reactor at Yongbyon.  Typically, light-water reactors are associated with civilian energy usage, however, uranium  enrichment is part of the process, it was not inconceivable that further enrichment could potentially ensue at weapons-grade levels.To date, North Korea is believed to have sufficient weaponized plutonium for about six atomic bombs, although there has been little evidence to suggest that the country has actively pursued a weapons program.  That being said, Western powers have been advocating a resumption of the stalled six-party talks dealing with North Korea's nuclear program.In November 2010, a senior United States Department of State envoy, Stephen Bosworth, was in Asia on a trip aimed at reviving the multilateral negotiations. However, this latest act of provocation by North Korea on Yeonpyeong Island left the United States with no choice but to disengage from the multilateral diplomatic process, essentially ruling out the resumption of six-party talks on North Korea's nuclear disarmament for the foreseeable future.On Nov. 23, 2010, in an interview with ABC News, United States President Barack Obama characterized North Korea's shelling of Yeonpyeong Island as ""a serious and ongoing threat that needs to be dealt with. President Obama also reaffirmed his country's alliance with South Korea, describing that country as an important ally. He said, ""We strongly affirm our commitment to defend South Korea as part of that alliance."" The United States president also noted, ""We want to make sure all the parties in the region recognize that this is a serious and ongoing threat that needs to be dealt with."" This statement appeared to target China, as he continued saying that Pyongyang needs to know ""that there are a set of international rules they need to abide by.""By the close of November 2010, tensions on the Korean peninsula remained high, as South Korea and the United States carried out joint military exercises in the Yellow Sea, to the south of the disputed maritime border. North Korea said it viewed the previously -arranged military exercises as a provocation and warned of retaliation if there was any violation of its territorial waters. A statement from Pyongyang broadcast by the state-controlled KCNA news agency read as follows: ""We will deliver a brutal military blow on any provocation which violates our territorial waters.""At the start of December 2010, South Korea took a highly assertive position. The South Korean defense minister-designate, Kim Kwan-jin, warned that North Korea would face a harsh response, including air strikes, if it dared to act aggressively in the future. Kim Kwan-jin's remarks were made in parliament as he answered questions during his confirmation hearing. In response to the question of how he would react to another violent action by North Korea, Kim Kwan-jin said, ""If North Korea provokes again, we will definitely use aircraft to attack North Korea."" Clearly, this posture by South Korea was a marked departure from its long-held restraint in the face of North Korea's provocations. Making clear that it intended to maintain this assertive posture, South Korea also said that it was going to carry out military drills from the aforementioned Yeonpyeong Island, even though North Korea has condemned those plans and warned that it would retaliate with force. With Pyongyang and Seoul at odds with one another in such a marked fashion, there were heightened anxieties about the renewal of war on the Korean peninsula.Yet even with those fears at hand, the landscape became even more complicated when in mid-December 2010, South Korea said that it suspected North Korea of secretly enriching uranium at locations beyond its main nuclear site at Yongbyon.  South Korean Foreign Minister Kim Sung-hwan would not confirm a media report that North Korea was home to three more plants where uranium enrichment could take place, however, he admitted to having suspicions along these lines. During a news conference, he said, ""It is a report based on what is still intelligence and let me just say that we have been following this issue for some time."" Should this claim be proved correct, North Korea could conceivably possess material -- potentially for building more nuclear bombs. Moreover, such actions would fly in the face of renewed nuclear disarmament talks, which were already on a downward slide as a result of North Korea's latest aggressive actions (as discussed above).By the third week of December 2010, intense dissonance characterized relations on the Korean peninsula for the myriad reasons discussed above. Former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, who also served as ambassador to the United Nations, was acting as an unofficial United States envoy in the region, with an eye on reducing the level of tensions. That job, however, was not helped when United Nations meetings on the matter ended with no resolution. Nevertheless, there were signs of progress when North Korea began to reverse course, effectively moving away from its threats to take retaliatory action against South Korea for the aforementioned military drills. The shift from Pyongyang came after South Korea evacuated residents from the area on and around Yeonpyeong Island and launched fighter jets from its terrain. Analysts surmised that the strong stance from South Korea may have forced North Korea to rethink the likely consequences of making good on expressed threats. As explained by Governor Richardson, ""South Korea was able to flex its muscles, and North Korea reacted in a statesmanlike manner.""  But despite these encouraging indications, on Dec. 23, 2010, the rhetoric between the two Koreas was on the rise once again. South Korea's president was promising harsh retaliation if his country was again attacked, while  North Korean was warning of a ""sacred"" nuclear war, if provoked.Meanwhile, Governor Richardson -- a seasoned diplomat -- who has had years of experience negotiating with the North Koreans, announced that North Korea was willing to offer concessions in regard to their nuclear program. In an interview with the Associated Press, Governor Richardson said, ""We had positive results."" He continued, ""I hope this will signal a new chapter and a round of dialogue to lessen tension on the Korean peninsula."" Given the increasing concerns about North Korea's capacity to build nuclear bombs, this development was welcomed. But, as United States Department of State spokesman, P.J. Crowley, cautioned, ""North Korea talks a great game. They always do. The real issue is what will they do. If they are agreeable to returning IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] inspectors to their country, they need to tell the IAEA that.""In a New Year's message at the close of 2010, North Korea appeared to strike a conciliatory note as it called for dialogue with South Korea. North Korea was reported to have called for ""a lasting peace system on the Korean Peninsula,"" which it said should be made ""nuclear-free through dialogue and negotiations."" Heightened tensions have marked relations between the two Koreas since the sinking of a South Korean warship by the North earlier in 2010, and reached a nadir at the close of the year, following the shelling of Yeonpyeong Island (under South Korean jurisdiction) by the North. For its part, Seoul opted to take a more aggressive stance in relation to Pyongyang since these events by carrying out military exercises in the border zones and increasing its rhetoric. Now, the call for improved relations by Pyongyang may have been interpreted as a shift in stance, aimed at lowering tensions on the Korean peninsula. However, Pyongyang's message, which was publicized via North Korean state media, went onto to warn of increased military strength. The New Year's message said that North Korea's military would ""conduct intense combat training in an atmosphere of actual battle as required by the tense situation.""On Feb. 9, 2011, bilateral talks between the two Koreas were reported to have broken down.  Delegates from North Korea and South Korea had been meeting in  the border village of Panmunjom with the intent of working through a number of sensitive cross-border issues.  There were hopes that the security talks would ease tensions between the two Koreas, which reached a nadir after the shelling of a South Korean island by North Korean forces in November 2010.  Significantly, these discussions were intended to set the foundation for further, higher-level, negotiations.  However, the disintegration of these talks meant that there was no consensus on an agenda for future meetings.In July 2011, some good news was brewing in the realm of foreign relations. The United States and North Korea completed a set of exploratory discussions, which North Korea's envoy, Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye Gwan, characterized as positive.  Speaking of his meetings with United States Ambassador Stephen Bosworth, the Obama administration's leading representative on North Korean affairs, Kim Kye Gwan said, ""Yesterday and today we discussed comprehensively, with Mr. Bosworth, matters of mutual interest. The talks were very constructive and businesslike and we continue to maintain contacts.""  For his part, Ambassador Bosworth said, ""These discussions are designed to explore the willingness of North Korea to take concrete and irreversible steps toward denuclearization."" These bilateral talks were intended to be a precursor to the resumption of multilateral denuclearization  negotiations.  To that end, Ambassador Bosworth said that his country would enter consultations with  South Korea and other countries involved multilateral negotiations that have been ongoing for years, to consider how to proceed further with North Korea.Later in August 2011, though, prospects for a return to multilateral talks were dimmed when an imbroglio ensued between North Korea and South Korea.  The situation was spurred when shells from North Korea were fired close to the maritime border with South Korea.  In response, the South Korean navy  fired warning shots towards North Korea. According to South Korean sources, artillery shells from North Korea landed in the Yellow Sea close to Yeonpyeong Island, which is under Seoul's jurisdiction.  Further rounds were fired on the same day.  Defense officials from South Korea  surmised that the initial firing of shells may have been due to training exercises by North Korea.  Nevertheless, South Korea wasted no time in responding with warning shots. It should be noted that Yeonpyeong Island was in the global purview in late 2010 when North Korea fired shells in that direction, leaving four people dead and triggering the outrage of South Korea and its allies.As the month drew to a close, tension increased when five South Koreans were arrested for spying on behalf of North Korea.  South Korean prosecutors said that the five individuals conveyed sensitive  military and political information to the North over a period of two decades.  Among the sensitive material were satellite images of major military installations, as well as field manuals of United States forces in South Korea.  All five individuals were accused by South Korean authorities of violating the country's  national security law, engaging in espionage, and communication with an enemy.***Special Update:On Dec. 19, 2011, it was announced that North Korea's mercurial and autocratic leader, Kim Jong-il, had died. Blamed for keeping North Koreans on the brink of starvation, the nation on the edge of economic collapse, and the global community in a state of anxiety over the country's nuclear program, Kim Jong- il was believed to have suffered a stroke in 2008. Since then, his health was regarded to be in a state of decline.Known as ""Dear Leader"" to the North Korean people, the rule of Kim Jong- il can well be viewed as one of the remaining ""cults of personality"" in the modern world.Attention quickly turned to who would fill the power chasm. To that end, the known ""great successor"" to stand at the helm of the country was Kim Jong- un -- the son of Kim Jong-il, whom had been promoted to the rank of general in the Korean People's Army more than a year earlier.At home in North Korea, citizens were urged to hold steadfast in their loyalty to Kim Jong-un.  As reported by the New York Times, North Korean television broadcast images of the country's senior military leaders saluting Kim Jong-un  as he received mourners at a mausoleum, where the body of Kim Jong-il laid in state.  The particular imagery was ostensibly intended to show that Kim Jong-un had gained the allegiance of North Korea's powerful military. Ultimately, Kim Jong-un would have to consolidate his power both symbolically and practically, or he could be relegated to a figurehead role at the helm of a ruling  military cadre.  But speculation on that score came to a close at the end of the year when  Kim Jong-un was offically named supreme commander of the country's armed forces. That particular appointment was made in accordance with provisions set forth in Kim Jong-il's will.As the world community wondered about the effects of Kim Jong-il's death on the matter of international security, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported that North Korea test-fired a missile off its eastern coast; South Korean officials apparently believed the missile launch was unrelated to the news ofKim Jong- il's death, although there was no official statement from South Korea's defense ministry.That being said, South Korea wasted no time placing its armed forces on high alert and the country itself was placed on a crisis footing. Likewise, the government of Japan held an emergency security meeting and expressed hopes that the news of Kim Jong- il's death would not have an ""adverse effect on peace and stability on the peninsula."" The Chinese government expressed distress and ""deep condolences"" over the news, and reaffirmed Beijing's close ties with Pyongyang. From Russia, the foreign ministry said it did not expect changes in bilateral relationship with North Korea. Across the Pacific in the United States, President Barack Obama reportedly discussed the situation with South Korean President Lee Myung-bak and promised that its commitment to stability on the Korean Peninsula remained intact. A statement from the White House read as follows: ""We remain committed to stability on the Korean peninsula, and to the freedom and security of our allies.""Ironically, news of Kim Jong-il's death came only days after a bilateral deal was forged between the United States and North Korea to exchange 240,000 tons of food from the United States for North Korea's pledge to move towards denuclearization . The agreement was brokered during talks in China between Robert King, United States special envoy on North Korean human rights, and Ri Kun, director general for North American affairs at North Korea's Foreign Ministry, and was intended to set the tone for forthcoming multilateral nuclear negotiations. Six-party talks -- involving North Korea, South Korea, Japan, China, Russia, and the United States -- have stalled since late 2008.According to South Korea's Yonhap news agency, Washington and Pyongyang ""reached the agreement based on North Korea's pledge to implement initial measures of denuclearization that include a suspension of its uranium-enrichment program."" North Korea, which has been plagued by chronic food shortages, would soon received shipments of food aid, including biscuits and nutritional supplements for infants, rather than rice, which was requested by the North Koreans. United States officials have apparently been concerned that rice would be given to the country's military rather than used to alleviate the dire circumstances of the North Korean general populace.There was some speculation about the late Kim Jong-il's involvement in forging this agreement, given the timing of the death announcement. If Kim Jong-il's health was devolving to the extent that he had died from ""great mental and physical strain,"" then was it possible for him to be involved in such significant negotiations?Such speculation was only heightened when, on Dec. 20, 2011, South Korean authorities began to express skepticism about the public details pertaining to the death of Kim Jong-il during a field guidance tour. Indeed, the leader of South Korea's intelligence service said he had doubts about the time and location of the North Korean leader's death. National Intelligence Service head, Won Sei-hoon, reportedly told the members of a parliamentary committee that the very train Kim Jong-il used for travel -- and which was supposedly the venue of the North Korean leader's death -- was identified at Pyongyang's train station. As reported by the Korean Herald, Won Sei-hoon noted, ""There were no signs the train ever moved."" Certainly, if the train was not used for any travel, it was not possible that Kim Jong- il could have died aboard it while participating in the aforementioned field guidance tour, as officially declared by the North Korean authorities.The quasi-mystery surrounding the actual details of Kim Jong-il's death aside, North Korea was concentrating its efforts on shoring up the image of Kim Jong-un as the undisputed new leader of the secretive communist nation. As reported by the New York Times, North Korean television broadcast images of the country's senior military leaders saluting Kim Jong-un as he received mourners at a mausoleum, where the body of Kim Jong-il laid in state. The particular imagery was ostensibly intended to show that Kim Jong-un had gained the allegiance of North Korea's powerful military. Meanwhile, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported that Kim Jong-un had carried out one of his first measures of supreme power by ordering all North Korean troops to cancel their field exercises and return to their barracks.His military influence notwithstanding, Kim Jong-un had yet to assume leadership as the general secretary of North Korea's Workers' Party -- the political power base of the country. Since 2010, Kim Jung-un held the position of vice chairman of the Central Military Commission of the ruling party.Ultimately, Kim Jong-un would have to consolidate his power both symbolically and practically, or he could be relegated to a figurehead role at the helm of a ruling military cadre. But speculation on that score came to a close at the end of the year when Kim Jong-un was offically named supreme commander of the country's armed forces. That particular appointment was made in accordance with provisions set forth in Kim Jong-il's will.It was yet to be seen how Kim Jong-un would relate to international powers, who were themselves anxious to see North Korea would move substantially in the direction of denuclearization at a time of sensitive geopolitical tensions across the globe. Following the funeral for the late Kim Jong-il on Dec. 28, 2011, state media in North Korea delivered a message from the powerful National Defense Commission of that country making ot clear that there would be no change in foreign policy orientation from Pyongyang in the post Kim Jong-il era. The statement read as follows: ""We declare solemnly and confidently that the foolish politicians around the world, including the puppet group in South Korea, should not expect any change from us."" Indeed, during the memorial funeral service for Kim Jong-il, the North Korean head of state, Kim Yong-name made it clear that the country -- now under new leadership -- intended to ""march firmly along the path of Songun taught by great leader Kim Jong-il."" The term ""Songun"" refers to North Korea's ""military first"" policy. Clearly, the military imperatives of North Korea would prevail even in the post Kim Jong-il era.On Feb. 29, 2012, North Korea formalized its ""denuclearization for food"" agreement with the United States. The terms of the bilateral deal included the exchange of 240,000 tons of food from the United States for North Korea's pledge to move towards denuclearization. The agreement included provisions for a North Korean moratorium on nuclear tests, long-range missile launches and uranium enrichment at its Yongbyon nuclear center, and acceptance of United Nations inspectors who would monitor the implementation of the terms. North Korea's acquiescence on this matter raised the possibility of ending the diplomatic impasse, which had allowed its nuclear program to continue for years without international oversight.Of course it should be noted that the agreement was not a new one; in fact it first came to light in the days prior to the news of the death of former North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il late in 2011. The agreement was brokered in December 2011 during talks in China between Robert King, United States special envoy on North Korean human rights, and Ri Kun, director general for North American affairs at North Korea's Foreign Ministry.At the time, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported that Washington and Pyongyang ""reached the agreement based on North Korea's pledge to implement initial measures of denuclearization that include a suspension of its uranium-enrichment program"" in exchange for much-needed food. North Korea, which has been plagued by chronic food shortages, would soon received shipments of food aid, including biscuits and nutritional supplements for infants, rather than rice, which was requested by the North Koreans. United States officials have apparently been concerned that rice would be given to the country's military rather than used to alleviate the dire circumstances of the North Korean general populace.The agreement was intended to set the tone for forthcoming multilateral nuclear negotiations. Six-party talks -- involving North Korea, South Korea, Japan, China, Russia, and the United States -- have stalled since late 2008.For its part, the United States welcomed the North Koreans' movement on the breakthrough deal, deeming it ""important, if limited."" The United States Department of State spokeswoman, Victoria Nuland, took a cautiously optimistic saying, ""The United States still has profound concerns regarding North Korean behavior across a wide range of areas, but today's announcement reflects important, if limited, progress in addressing some of these.""Striking a similar tone, the director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Yukiya Amano, characterized the announcement ""an important step forward."" He continued, ""Pending further details, we stand ready to return to Yongbyon to undertake monitoring activities upon request and with the agreement of the agency's board of governors.""In the aftermath of a ""denuclearization for food"" agreement with the United States, there were high hopes that the deal would facilitate progress in multilateral negotiations on North Korea's nuclear program. Those high hopes were somewhat dashed by news that North Korea intended to launch a satellite into orbit.Pyongyang announced on March 16, 2011, that it would launch an ""earth observation"" satellite, or the Kwangmyongsong-3, using a long-range rocket. The event was intended to mark the 100th birthday of its late leader Kim Il-Sung. Of course, such a move would be contrary to the prevailing United Nations resolutions, which prohibits North Korea's use of long-range intercontinental ballistic missile technology, as well as the aforementioned ""denuclearization for food"" agreement, the latter of which requires North Korea to adhere to a moratorium on nuclear tests and long-range missile launches.Not surprisingly, all the other countries involved in multilateral negotiations -- South Korea, Japan, China, Russia, and the United States -- expressed dismay over this plan by North Korea. United States Department of State spokesperson, Nuland, pointed to this concurrence and urged North Korea to rethink the satellite launch saying, ""Obviously, we were heartened that every single one of the six-party talks participants made clear that they think that this would be an extremely bad idea and a violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions, so we are hoping and expecting that the DPRK will take that to heart."" The United States also noted it would be ""very hard"" to go forward with its planned food assistance if North Korea moved ahead with the plan to launch a satellite into orbit.The geopolitical complexity of the Korean peninsula became more complicated on March 21, 2012, when the White House in the United States announced that President Barack Obama intended to visit to the world's most heavily militarized border -- the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). The White House explained that the trip to the DMZ was intended to convey the president's support for the 30,000 United States troops stationed in South Korea, and to augment bilateral relations between Washington and Seoul. In a press briefing, Daniel Russel, Asia director for the White House National Security Council, said: ""The DMZ is the front line of democracy in the Korean Peninsula, and it's the symbol of the U.S. and [South Korean] resolve, as well as solidarity. So a visit by the president there to see and to thank the U.S. and the South Korean service members makes perfect sense.""After his visit to the DMZ, President Obama was set to attend a global summit aimed at reducing the risk of nuclear terrorism in the South Korean capital of Seoul. Ahead of the Nuclear Security Summit, President Obama reiterated his call for ""a world without nuclear weapons"" and advanced his foreign policy agenda that advocates non-proliferation and the reduction of nuclear weapons through increase diplomacy.In a speech to students at South Korea's Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, President Obama said the United States -- the only nation to have ever used nuclear weapons -- was fully committed to reducing its stockpile of nuclear arms. The United States leader said his country had a ""moral obligation"" to pursue strategic arms cuts. President Obama also drew thunderous applause from the audience of students when he said that, as a father, he did not wish to see his daughters growing up in a world with nuclear threats.""I say this as president of the only nation ever to use nuclear weapons,"" Obama said. ""I say it as a commander in chief who knows that our nuclear codes are never far from my side. Most of all, I say it as a father, who wants my two young daughters to grow up in a world where everything they know and love can't be instantly wiped out.""President Obama acknowledged his country's unique position in the world, but he noted that ""serious sustained global effort"" was needed to achieve his expressed hope for a nuclear weapons-free world.The issue of nuclear proliferation has been at the forefront of the international purview given the ongoing concerns about North Korea's nuclear arsenal. Addressing the matter of North Korea's nuclear ambitions, President Obama made it clear that the United States held ""no hostile intent"" to that country, but warned that there would be ""no rewards for provocation.""The United States president said: ""The United States has no hostile intent toward your country...We are committed to peace. And we are prepared to take steps to improve relations, which is why we have offered nutritional aid to North Korean mothers and children."" President Obama continued, ""But by now it should be clear, your provocations and pursuit of nuclear weapons have not achieved the security you seek -- they have undermined it. Instead of the dignity you desire, you're more isolated. Instead of earning the respect of the world, you've been met with strong sanctions and condemnation. You can continue down the road you are on, but we know where that leads. It leads to more of the same -- more broken dreams, more isolation, ever more distance between the people of North Korea and the dignity and the opportunity that they deserve.""President Obama reiterated the warning already issued by his government that the long-range missile launch to place a satellite in orbit would only result in isolation for Pyongyang.He said,  ""With respect to North Korea, we are going to be both sending messages to North Korea that they should not go forward with this missile launch, which would violate existing U.N. Security Council resolutions. And our hope is, is that we can resolve these issues diplomatically.""President Obama also joined South Korean President Lee Myung-bak in noting that North Korea would be subject to further sanctions if it did not cancel its launch plans. Making clear the options available for North Korea, President Obama addressed the leadership of that country saying, ""You can continue with the road you are on but we know where that leads...Today, we say: Pyongyang, have the courage to pursue peace.""For his part,  Kim Jong Un -- North Korea's new leader -- appeared to be following his father's footsteps in the realm of rhetoric as he deemed the  nuclear summit to be  ""a childish farce.""  Earlier, Pyongyang asserted that  denunciations of North Korea  would amount to a ""declaration of war.""Pyongyang was also signaling that it had no intention of pulling back from its missile launch to sent a satellite into orbit. Instead,  South Korean sources were reporting that North Korea  moved a long-range rocket to a launch pad close to the Chinese border.  As well, satellite imagery appeared to depict preparations for the launch, which Pyongyang had said would take place between April 12-16, 2012.  The guidance was that the rocket would follow a  trajectory that would take it close to south-western Japan.Accordingly, Japan's defense ministry made it clear that it had ordered the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) to intercept North Korea's rocket launch, if necessary, using its missile shield.  Japanese authorities also alerted rescue personnel that they would be mobilized to deal with potential disasters, should the  veer off course. Already, the South Korean government had said that it would  shoot down any North Korean rocket that strayed into its territory. As well, the United States was sea-based X-band radar into the Pacific to monitor the launch. Upset about the prospect of rocket debris affecting countries of the Pacific, President Benigno Aquino III of the Philippines called on Pyongyang to abandon the launch plans.It should be noted that the Obama administration in the United States canceled its food aid program to North Korea due to that country's decision to move forward with the satellite launch.  An official from the Pentagon was cited as saying: ""Why we're not providing that food assistance at this point is because our confidence in their ability to meet their agreements has been diminished. We do not use it as a lever to change their policies.""A week ahead of the timeline expected for the North Korean missile launch, President Kim Jong Un warned that any country dared to interfere with its plans  would face ""immediate, resolute and merciless punishment.""  In a statement published by  the Korean Central News Agency, the North Korean leader asserted: ""(Any country that) intercepts the satellite or collects its debris will meet immediate, resolute and merciless punishment.""  Pyongyang also warned South Korea against intercepting the rocket booster, should it stray into South Korean territorial waters.  Pyongyang promised that an interception by Seoul would bring about ""the end of everything in South Korea.""On April 10, 2012, the United States was reiterating its warnings to North Korea that the launch of a new missile would be ""a clear and serious violation"" of international agreements.  White House press secretary Jay Carney said in an interview with journalists: ""The proposed missile launch, if conducted, would represent a clear and serious violation of North Korea's obligations under two United Nations Security Council resolutions that explicitly prohibit North Korea from testing ballistic missiles.""By April 13, 2012, news emerged from North Korea that although that country attempted to launch its satellite into space, the long-range rocket failed to reach orbit.  Despite the spectacular failure of the mission, the attempted action was nonetheless widely condemned by the international community.  Notably, members of the Group of Eight industrial nation states issued a joint condemnation, noting that the launch was in clear violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions prohibiting intercontinental missile deployments.In a related development, South Korean officials were noting that new satellite imagery suggests that North Korea was preparing to carry out a nuclear test. The imagery depicted piles of earth and sand at the entrance of a tunnel at a nuclear site, where previous nuclear bomb testing was carried out in 2006 and 2009.  An anonymous source was quoted by Agence France Presse as saying: ""Recent satellite images led us to conclude the North has been secretly digging a new underground tunnel in the nuclear test site... besides two others where the previous tests were conducted.""  Given the aforementioned launch failure, there were some suggestions that North Korea might try to ""save face"" by moving forward with an even more provocative act -- quite possibly, a nuclear test.  Of course, such an act would be regarded as a clear move down the path of confrontation by North Korea's regional neighbors as well as Western powers.By the third week of April 2012, presumably as a cautionary move, South Korea  announced that it had deployed missiles with a range of 625 miles. The weapons would be able to strike nuclear targets inside North Korea.As April 2012 entered its final week, North Korea was ratcheting up the militaristic rhetoric as it threatened to  initiate military action against South Korean targets and characterized South Korean President Lee Myung-bak a ""traitor"" and ""scum."" In a statement, Pyongyang issued the following threat: ""The special actions of our revolutionary armed forces will start soon to meet the reckless challenge of the group of traitors.  Once the … special actions kick off, they will reduce all the rat-like groups and the bases for provocations to ashes in 3 or 4 minutes ... by unprecedented peculiar means and methods of our own style.""Meanwhile, reports suggested that North Korea was close to completing preparations for a  nuclear test. This move -- if successful -- would constitute North Korea's third nuclear test after two in 2006 and 2009. The global community was watching events unfold in North Korea closely as  Pyongyang may now have the capacity to conduct a test using highly enriched uranium for the very first time.  This development would presage North Korea's possible ability to  significantly build up its stocks of weapons-grade nuclear material.  As well, it would facilitate the manufacture of a nuclear warhead to mount on a long-range missile.  Should North Korea go forward with its third nuclear test, it would be a clear example of the limits of China's influence on the paranoid  regime ruling North Korea today.At the start of December 2012, North Korea announced plans to carry out a new satellite launch.  A failed attempt to launch an ""earth observation"" satellite ensued in April 2012 when the long-range rocket crashed into the sea after traveling only a short distance.Now, in December 2012, North Korea was planning to launch a second version of Kwangmyongsong-3 (called the Unha-3) into space from the Sohae Space Center in  North Phyongan Province. The official North Korean state news agency said the satellite launch was set to occur roughly between Dec. 10, 2012, and Dec. 22, 2012.The United States issued a warning that the long-range missile launch to place a satellite in orbit  would threaten global peace and security, and  only result in isolation for Pyongyang. The United States also noted, as it did in April 2012, that such a move would be contrary to the prevailing United Nations resolutions, which prohibits North Korea's use of long-range intercontinental ballistic missile technology.  In a written statement, United States Department of State spokesperson Victoria Nuland declared:  ""A North Korean 'satellite' launch would be a highly provocative act that threatens peace and security in the region...Any North Korean launch using ballistic missile technology is in direct violation of UN Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs) 1718 and 1874.""  Nuland also noted that her country would be consulting with key partner countries, such as South Korea, Japan, China, and Russia, to discuss further steps in regards to these proposed moves by North Korea.By Dec. 7. 2012, there were more signs that the rocket launch plan was going forward as fuel-injection work  was reported to be taking place, according to South Korean media. Days earlier on Dec. 4, 2012, North Korea confirmed its plans to go forward with the rocket launch as it conveyed plans to the International Maritime Organization -- the United Nations' shipping agency.  Typically, such notification to the International Maritime Organization in such instances. Further details about the launch were released including the news that the three-stage rocket was expected to fly on a southward path and would drop into the sea off the west coast of South Korea, ultimately  landing in waters to the east of the Philippines. Since the flight path would take the rocket close to Japan's Okinawa island, the government of Japan was  positioning missile defense interceptors in order to be prepared  for the rocket charting off course.  It should be noted that this long-range rocket has sufficient range to reach the western part of the United States.On Dec. 9, 2012, North Korean authorities announced that the rocket launch -- due to take place between Dec. 10, 2012 and Dec. 22, 2012 -- was being delayed due to technical difficulties.  However, by Dec. 11, 2012, those technical difficulties were apparently resolved as international news media outlets reported that North Korea had fired its long-range Unha-3 rocket rocket from its west coast. According to the South Korean Yonhap News Agency, some debris from the rocket fell into waters off the Philippines after passing over the Japanese city of Okinawa, consistent with the expected trajectory.The firing of the rocket was supposedly  intended to launch a satellite into space.  North Korea announced that its goal had been achieved and a satellite was placed in orbit.The North Korean state news agency claimed success in its goal, declaring: ""The launch of the second version of our Kwangmyongsong-3 [Unha-3] satellite from the Sohae Space Centre... on December 12 was successful. The satellite has entered the orbit as planned.""It should be noted that while United States officials confirmed there was an object launched into orbit, it also noted that the object appeared to be wobbling off course.  South Korean defense sources had a somewhat different view and suggested that the satellite  was not necessarily  wobbling off course or out of control.  The South Koreans said that the satellite may have been intended to be in a circular orbit but was instead an elliptical orbit.There were also some questions about the level of success achieved in this exercise by the North Koreans.  Some experts, such as Vassily Mikheev of Russia's Institute for World Economy and International Relations, have pointed to the fact that North Korean engineers used old technology to launch the satellite into orbit. Mikheev noted that Scud technology  was intended for small missiles, and therefore  not particularly reliable  for firing a three-phased operation.Of course, the conventional wisdom was that the entire exercise was a pretense, and intended to demonstrate North Korea's technological capacity to deliver a nuclear warhead on a intercontinental ballistic missile.Regardless of actual motivation, the move by North Korea was made in defiance of international warnings that Pyongyang refrain from such provocative activity, and certainly in clear violation of prevailing United Nations Security Council resolutions.  Accordingly, the United Nations Security Council wasted no time in condemning North Korea for its actions, and making note that the launch was""a clear violation of Security Council resolutions.""  China -- North Korea's closest ally -- expressed ""regret"" over North Korea's decision to fire the rocket while calling for restraint on the part of the international community in response.  But  the United States was already  warning that Pyongyang would face consequences for its ""highly provocative act that threatens regional security.""  There were suggestions that a new resolution by the United Nations Security Council was in the offing, but with China's position on such a measure unknown.Meanwhile, all expectations were that North Korea was likely going to carry out a nuclear test. In 2009, following a rocket launch that year, North Korea carried out its second ever nuclear test. North Korea's first nuclear test was carried out in 2006. Two rounds of sanctions were imposed on North Korea in response to those provocative actions. Now, with another rocket launch accomplished, it was anticipated that North Korea would again follow that path and carry out a third nuclear test. Of course, it should be noted that North Korea was pursuing expensive nuclear development and rocket delivery technology even as most of its population lived in a state of abject poverty. Thus, the notion of further economic sanctions was unlikely to deter the paranoid and reclusive regime, which has long privileged its military agenda ahead of domestic concerns.***Special Report:2013 Special Report:

North Korea -- a threat to global security?

Summary:       On Feb. 12, 2013, North Korea carried out its third nuclear test, earning the wide and vociferous condemnation of the international community.  North Korea cast the test as a restrained response and warned of further actions in the face of ""U.S. hostility.""  The nuclear test was not unexpected, coming on the heels of a rocket launch in December 2012, which led to the United Nations'  early 2013 decision to tighten sanctions against North Korea.  North Korea under its new leader, Kim-Jong-un, has increased the anxiety of the international community by intensifying its rhetoric and threatening even more provocative actions.       In the face of such provocation, the United Nations Security Council  convened an emergency meeting to consider measures against North Korea -- a country that has, to date, been undeterred by international action or prevailing international law.  Indeed, the very existence of sanctions has not stopped North Korea from repeatedly violating the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.  North Korea's lack of concern for international opinion was displayed in high relief in mid-February 2013 when the state-controlled newspaper declared the country's need for intercontinental ballistic missiles.  Anxieties over global security reached new heights as news reports began to emerge about Iran playing a role in North Korea's nuclear development program.       In March 2013,  the United Nations Security Council acted against North Korea by  unanimously adopting Resolution 2094, which censured North Korea for its February 2013 nuclear test and imposing an even stricter sanctions regime on that country. At that time, tensions were increasing on the Korean peninsular, with North Korea using sharp rhetoric to issue threats against South Korea, even ending its armistice with the South that brought an end to the hostilities between the two Koreas, and ultimately declaring it was in ""a state of war"" with South Korea.  North Korea also cut off its emergency hotline with South Korea; by April 2013, North Korea  decided to re-open its nuclear complex at Yongbyon  and ceased border crossing access for South Koreans into the jointly-administered Kaesong industrial zone, which has often been viewed as a symbol of cross-border cooperation. North Korea, meanwhile, declared its enmity with the United States, warning that strikes on American interests might be in the offing, and pointing to United States military interests in Japan and Guam, presumably indicated they might be on Pyongyang's target list.  The North Korean military additionally claimed to have ""ratified"" a possible attack on the United States.       But by May 2013, the political climate appeared to have cooled and North Korea withdrew  two intermediate range missiles it had placed earlier on its east coast.  Nevertheless,  North Korea went onto to carry out four short range missile tests in mid-May 2013.  It was not known if North Korea was trying to re-ignite geo-political tensions or if the tests were routine exercises intended to simply show military might.  A month later in June 2013, there was a bizarre mix of progress and retreat on the diplomatic front as the two Koreas  planned and then cancelled bilateral negotiations; however, North Korea then proposed direct talks with the United States.       In August  2013 through September 2013, the two Koreas finally agreed to re-open operations at the jointly-administered Kaesong industrial zone. But in the second week of September 2013, signs pointed to the fact that operations were being restarted at North Korea's Yongbyon reactor.  It seemed that regardless of calming of tensions, North Korea was going forward with the threat made in April 2013 about re-opening its Yongbyon facility.       Background:       On Jan. 22, 2013,  the United Nations Security Council unanimously approved a resolution authorizing tighter sanctions against North Korea over its December 2012 rocket launch, which  at the time spurred international condemnation.   North Korea angrily responded  to the move by promising further rocket launches and nuclear testing, and also warning of retribution against the United States, which it described as a ""sworn enemy.""  The following statement was issued via the official Korean Central News Agency: ""We do not hide that a variety of satellites and long-range rockets will be launched and a nuclear test of higher level will be carried out in the upcoming new phase of the anti-U.S. struggle, targeting against the U.S., the sworn enemy of the Korean people.""  Pyongyang soon expanded its threats to note that it would take action against South Korea if it participated in the United Nations sanctions regime.  China's  official Xinhua News Agency also reported that Pyongyang intended to walk away from multilateral six-part talks since ""the U.N. Security Council has been reduced into an organization bereft of impartiality and balance.""       North Korea has not been a stranger to strong rhetoric, and since the December 2012 rocket launch, all expectations were that North Korea would follow its previous pattern of behavior and carry out a nuclear test.  To that end, South Korea's Yonhap News referenced  South Korean intelligence sources in reporting that North Korea had completed technical preparations for a nuclear test.  Thus, the nuclear test and belligerent threats against the United States  and South Korea were, in many senses, not surprising reactions from North Korea.  The decision to brand the United Nations Security Council an impartial entity and walk away from multilateral talks was perhaps the more unexpected path taken by Pyongyang, since China -- North Korea's closest ally -- is a veto-wielding member of that body.       But  by the end of January 2013, North Korea took its rhetoric to another level when it promised action at an even ""higher level"" than a nuclear test.  The position of the North Korean leadership was reported in the Rodong Sinmun state newspaper as follows:  ""It is the people's demand that we should do something, not just a nuclear test, but something even greater. The U.N. Security Council has left us no room for choice.""       This bellicose language continued in February 2013 when  Pyongyang again threatened ""stronger measures""  than simply a third nuclear test in response to ""hostile"" sanctions by the international community.  A statement by North Korea's state news agency read as follows: ""The DPRK (Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea, or North Korea) has drawn a final conclusion that it will have to take a measure stronger than a nuclear test to cope with the hostile forces nuclear war moves that have become ever more undisguised.""  There was no indication as to what form those ""stronger measures"" might entail although there was some suggestion that North Korea might use enriched weapons grade uranium, rather than plutonium,  in an explosion of some sort.       The use of uranium  could indicate North Korea's intent to expand its nuclear arsenal through uranium enrichment.   It would also incur a high level of risk.  As noted by  Siegfried Hecker, former director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico  and a professor at Stanford University in California, in  Foreign Policy magazine: ""If a next test is well contained, then we may learn nothing about the device. However, one of the risks Pyongyang takes in trying to demonstrate a test at a higher level is that they may produce fissures that allow radioactive seepage or possibly cause a major blowout from the tunnel.""       North Korea's bellicose language was matched with provocative visual imagery.  At issue was the release of a  three-minute video on YouTube depicting a North Korean man's dream sequence in which the city of New York is destroyed, with the 1985 song ""We are the world"" playing in the background.   A caption, which was translated from Korean in The Guardian newspaper, reads as follows: ""Somewhere in the United States, black clouds of smoke are billowing.  It seems that the nest of wickedness is ablaze with the fire started by itself.""   It continues:  ""Despite attempts by imperialists to isolate and crush us … never will anyone be able to stop the people marching towards a final victory."" The video was reported to have been released by  North Korea's state-run media and while of amateur quality in some regards, it nonetheless represented a sharp threat against the United States and/or the interests of its allies.       Two dates that North Korea might be considering for a nuclear test were Feb. 16, 2013, the birthday of former leader, Kim Jong-il, or Feb. 25, 2013, the inauguration date of Park Geun-hye of South Korea.       North Korea's third nuclear test       On Feb. 12, 2013, seismic activity in North Korea suggested that officials may have selected an even earlier date to go forward with a third nuclear test.  The seismic shock activity emanated from the same area where North Korea had conducted its 2006 and 2009 nuclear tests. Kim Min-seok of the South Korean Defense Ministry indicated that country's belief, saying, ""We believe that North Korea has conducted a nuclear test.""  Meanwhile, the United States Geological Survey indirectly confirmed that the test had taken place as it noted the shock appeared to be one kilometer underground and was consistent with a nuclear blast.  According to Lassina Zerbo, the director of the international data center of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test Ban Treaty Organization, the magnitude of the test was twice as large as the 2009 nuclear test.  It should be noted that initial reports suggested the use of  plutonium in this nuclear test, which tends to be suited for use as a missile warhead.       North Korea itself soon confirmed that it had carried out  its third underground nuclear test, which it said involved a ""miniaturized"" nuclear device. As reported in a statement by the state-run  KCNA news agency: ""It was confirmed that the nuclear test that was carried out at a high level in a safe and perfect manner using a miniaturized and lighter nuclear device with greater explosive force than previously did not pose any negative impact on the surrounding ecological environment.""       North Korea claimed its third nuclear test  was an act of self-defense against ""U.S. hostility"" and warned that further  moves might be in the offing.  Via the state-controlled KCNA news agency, Pyongyang claimed  that the nuclear test  ""was only the first response"" taken ""with maximum restraint.""  Pyongyang warned that further actions were in the offing, saying: ""If the United States continues to come out with hostility and complicates the situation, we will be forced to take stronger, second and third responses in consecutive steps.""       International Response       The chorus of condemnation from the international community was broad and vociferous. United Nations  Secretary General Ban Ki-moon wasted no time in condemning North Korea's nuclear test, which he emphasized was a ""clear and grave violation"" of United Nations resolutions. NATO cast the nuclear test as an ""irresponsible act"" that posed a serious threat to world peace.  Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov demanded that North Korea  abandon its nuclear program and return to the negotiating table. China, North Korea's closest ally, demanded an audience with the North Korean ambassador in Beijing, while Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi said China was ""strongly dissatisfied and resolutely opposed"" to the nuclear test.   Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe declared the nuclear test to be a ""grave threat"" and vowed that it could not be tolerated.  In a statement, United States President Barack Obama argued for a swift response, asserting: ""The danger posed by North Korea's threatening activities warrants further swift and credible action by the international community. The United States will also continue to take steps necessary to defend ourselves and our allies.""  But perhaps the most scathing response came from Denmark's  Foreign Minister Villy Sovndal, who said: ""This [nuclear test] deserves only one thing and that is a one-sided condemnation.  North Korea is likely the most horrible country on this planet.""       The United Nations Security Council convened an emergency meeting later on Feb. 12, 2013 to discuss future measures. During that meeting, the permanent and rotating member nations of the United Nations Security Council  unanimously condemned North Korea's latest nuclear test and warned that ""appropriate measures"" would be in the offing.       Clearly, North Korea would be faced with the prospects of international action.  Even its closest ally, China, via its state-controlled media, had urged North Korea not to go forward with such a provocative action  and warned that North Korea would pay a ""heavy price""  if it proceeded with the test.  Of course, in the realm of international jurisprudence, heavy costs have come in the form of harsh sanctions by the United Nations Security Council, which have done little to curtail North Korea from going forward with its missile  program and nuclear development agenda.  Indeed, the very existence of sanctions has not stopped North Korea from repeatedly violating the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.       Belligerence and Brinkmanship       North Korea's lack of concern for international opinion was displayed in high relief when the state-controlled newspaper declared the country's need for intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).  Only two days after carrying out  its third nuclear test, North Korea displayed its brazen stance by declaring that it should own ICBMs since the  ""imperialists""  -- an apparent reference to the United States -- had a nuclear arsenal. According to a review in Rodong Sinmun, North Korea's main newspaper and an apparent mouthpiece for the North Korean government --  the country required ICBMs to augment its self-defense.  The article in Rodong Sinmun also declared that North Korea would be a formidable enemy in the face of adversity or any challenge, and warned that there ""can be no compromise in the last fight to herald the victory for independence for humanity.""  The diatribe also included the promise to  ""strike a blow to end imperialism.""       The North Koreans' efforts to develop  ICBM capacity were apparently  not being undertaken in isolation. According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, there  were suggestions that the Iranians might be assisting the North Koreans with the development of a rocket program.  Blog 38  at Johns Hopkins University noted that its analysis of satellite imagery taken in early 2013 showed that  preparations were being made for an impending test of a liquid-fueled rocket.  That satellite imagery  further showed that North Korea could conceivably test rockets larger than the size of the rocket deployed in late 2012 from a new launch pad.  As stated in the report published in Blog 38: ""Analysis of construction activities around the new launch pad has revealed evidence that Pyongyang's rocket program may be receiving assistance from Iran.""       Since Iran was already ensconced its its own controversial nuclear development program -- to the great consternation of the international community -- the news of a possible connection between Pyongyang and Tehran was being  met with alarm across the world.  Indeed, there was a growing sense of anxiety about global security as a result.  That being said, the general consensus was that North Korea had not, to date,  developed the ability to deploy a nuclear warhead on an ICBM.       In the last week of February 2013, researchers at Johns Hopkins University -- via  Blog 38 -- said that satellite imagery of the nuclear test facility show possible signs of human activity there, even after the third nuclear test.  They suggested that North Korea might be preparing for a fourth nuclear test.  As stated in Blog 38: ""It remains unclear whether renewed activity at the site is normal for the days after a nuclear detonation or if it is an indication of Pyongyang's intention to conduct another test in the near future.""  Sources from the Chinese government suggested that Pyongyang was waiting for possible action from the United Nations Security Council  before it makes a decision on   a fourth nuclear test.       Consequences       With news circulating in the first week of March 2013  that a draft  of a United Nations Security Council resolution against North Korea had been crafted, Pyongyang wasted little time in registering its anger.  On March 5, 2013, North Korea warned that it would end its 1953 armistice (ceasefire) that brought a conclusion to the conflict with South Korea, without officially ending the Korean War.  North Korea also demanded that the United States and South Korea end its ongoing military drills in the region, referring to them as a ""dangerous nuclear war targeted at us.""  Furthermore, the Korean People's Army warned that it would carry out stronger actions  in response to the ""hostile"" policies of the United States and South Korea. It was apparent that North Korea was prepared to take an aggressive stance in the face of international pressure.       On March 7, 2013, the United Nations Security Council unanimous adopted Resolution 2094 censuring North Korea for its February  nuclear test and imposing an even stricter sanctions regime on that country.   Included in those new sanctions were provisions to target the financing sources of North Korea's nuclear and missile technology, but there were additional penalties imposed on North Korea in the realm of banking, travel, transportation,  and trade.       As stated by United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Susan Rice, ""The strength, breadth and severity of these sanctions will raise the cost to North Korea of its illicit nuclear program. Taken together, these sanctions will bite and bite hard.""  South Korea's Ambassador to the United Nations, Kim Sook, said the time had come for North Korea to ""wake up from its delusion"" of becoming a nuclear state. He continued, ""It can either take the right path toward a bright future and prosperity, or it can take a bad road toward further and deeper isolation and eventual self-destruction.""  Meanwhile,  United Nations  Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the unanimous adoption of the resolution delivered a strong message to North Korea that its pursuit of nuclear weapons would not be tolerated by the international community.       In  addition to scrapping its non-aggression agreements with South Korea, North Korea responded to the news of international action by saying that it would be  cutting off the North-South hot-line. Installed in 1971, the hot-line was created to provide direct communication at  times of increased tensions and also to organize the transfer of persons and goods through the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone.  Clearly, the disabling of the hot-line was not only symbolic of the breakdown in bilateral relations between the two Koreas, there were also practical and security implications.       It should be noted that North Korea has also shockingly threatened to  launch pre-emptive nuclear attacks on the United States and South Korea in response to the joint military drills, which it said were proof of the United States' intent to go to war.  A belligerent North Korea said via its Foreign Ministry that the United Nations' action would ""compel"" that country to take ""countermeasures"" in short order.    Furthermore, it declared in a statement: ""Now that the U.S. is set to light a fuse for a nuclear war, the revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK will exercise the right to a pre-emptive nuclear attack to destroy the strongholds of the aggressors and to defend the supreme interests of the country."" North Korea even threatened to transform   Washington and Seoul into ""a sea in flames"" with ""lighter and smaller nukes.""       For its part, South Korea was undeterred and moving forward with the very joint military drills (with the United States) that earned outrage and threats from Pyongyang. Still, South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se said on March 11, 2013, that his country would try to re-engage with North Korea with an eye on shifting the climate from tension and threats to cooperation. In an address, Yun said his goal was to ""turn this era of confrontation and mistrust into an era of trust and cooperation with North Korea.""  Yun further asserted: ""The security situation on the Korean Peninsula for now is very grave as the unpredictability surrounding North Korea is rising following its third nuclear test.""       Escalating Tensions       As March 2013 was drawing to a close, North Korea increased its belligerent rhetoric and said that missile and artillery units were combat-ready and aimed at United States and South Korean targets.  In a statement broadcast on the  state-controlled Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), the Korean People's Army's Supreme Command said: ""From this moment, the Supreme Command puts all of its field artillery including strategic rocket units and long-range artillery units into the No. 1 combat ready  posture.""  The statement further delineated targets in South Korea and the United States -- from its military installations in the Pacific to Hawaii and the mainland.  Indeed, a North Korean spokesperson was on the record saying, ""The U.S. should not forget that the Anderson Air Force Base on Guam, where B-52s take off, and naval bases in Japan proper and Okinawa, where nuclear-powered submarines are launched, are within the striking range of [North Korea's] precision strike means.""  North Korea said that its motivation was driven by the priority ""to safeguard our sovereignty and the highest dignity [of leader Kim Jong Un] through military actions.""       The United States responded with its own statement as follows: ""North Korea's bellicose rhetoric and threats follow a pattern designed to raise tensions and intimidate others. While the United Nations Command, Combined Forces Command and U.S. Forces Korea continue to maintain the armistice, North Korea continues its provocative behavior and rhetoric. The Republic of Korea-U.S. alliance is strong and we remain committed to the defense of [South Korea].""       Then, on March 30, 2013, North Korea declared it was in a ""state of war"" with South Korea and that its the long-standing truce with the South had ended.  A statement from Pyongyang read as follows: ""From this time on, the North-South relations will be entering the state of war and all issues raised between the North and South will be handled accordingly. The long-standing situation of the Korean peninsula being neither at peace nor at war is finally over.""   In response, the South Korean defense ministry denounced the war threat and issued its own statement, which read as follows: ""Our military is maintaining full preparedness to leave no blind point in safeguarding the lives and safety of the people.""  As well, South Korean President Park Geun-hye noted that her country was taking the  threats from North Korea ""very seriously.""  She said, ""If there is any provocation against South Korea and its people, there should be a strong response in initial combat without any political considerations.""       For its part, the United States military command in South Korea dispatched a statement that read as follows:  ""North Korea will achieve nothing by threats or provocations, which will only further isolate North Korea and undermine international efforts to ensure peace and stability in Northeast Asia.""       Matching its words  with concrete illustrations, the United States was also displaying its military versatility by deploying B-2 and B-52 planes with nuclear capabilities over South Korea, while also flying F-22 Raptor fighter jets from Japan to South Korea's Osan Air base. As well, as noted below, the United States said it would deploy additional ballistic-missile interceptors along the country's Pacific Coast, with an eye on protecting the United States from a potential attack from North Korea.  As well, the United States  moved its  sea-based  X-Band radar platform, normally based in Hawaii, closer to the North Korean coast, with the intent of monitoring  potential attempts from North Korea to launch a long-range missile.  By April 2013, the United States  additionally decided to deploy an anti-missile system to Guam.       Tensions on the Korean Peninsular escalated on April 2, 2013 when  the state-controlled Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) of the North Korea announced that it would be re-opening its main nuclear complex at Yongbyon and restarting its nuclear reactor there.       The Yongbyon complex was home to both a uranium enrichment facility and a nuclear reactor; it  was closed as a part of a 2007 agreement between North Korea and a multilateral cadre, including China and the United States.  The agreement mandated the closure of the reactor at Yongbyon  in lieu of one million metric tons of heavy fuel oil as well as humanitarian aid benefits.   The agreement was only really in effect for a couple of years since  North Korea resumed the reprocessing of  fuel rods stored at the site in 2009, complaining that it did not receive the desired level of energy assistance.       This 2013 decision to open the Yongbyon complex and restart operations of the nuclear reactor was illustrative of  the intensification of dissonance on the Korean peninsular ongoing since late 2012.  But it was also a disturbing development as it showed that the new leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un, was prepared to take increasingly provocative actions.  As a result, the international community was now regarding the paranoid and alienated nation state of nuclearized North Korea through the valence of anxiety.       Reflecting this sentiment, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he was ""deeply dismayed"" by North Korea's decision to re-open the main nuclear complex at Yongbyon and restart the nuclear reactor.  He further condemned the provocative actions declaring: ""The current crisis has already gone too far. Nuclear threats are not a game. Aggressive rhetoric and military posturing only result in counter-actions, and fuel fear and instability.""       Secretary General Ban urged all partied to engage in urgent talks as  ""the only way to resolve the current crisis."" However, with North Korea cutting off its military hot-line with South Korea, canceling its armistice with that country,  using the rhetoric of war, and re-opening its Yongbyon facility, it seemed that authorities in Pyongyang were not in the mood for productive diplomatic engagement.       Indeed, a day later on April 3, 2013,  North Korea has ceased border crossing access for South Koreans into the jointly-administered Kaesong industrial zone. Since Kaesong has been viewed as a tacit symbol of the state of geopolitical relations and the last significant arena of cooperation between the two Koreas, the cessation of cross-border access at the industrial zone was regarded as a disturbing development.       By April 4, 2013, the state-controlled Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said the military had ""ratified"" an attack on United States interests.  The KCNA statement further noted that North Korean troops had been authorized to counteract American aggression with ""powerful practical military counteractions,"" including nuclear weapons, and involving ""cutting-edge smaller, lighter, and diversified nuclear strike means.""  The KCNA statement included the following warning: ""The moment of explosion is approaching fast. No one can say a war will break out in Korea or not and whether it will break out today or tomorrow.""  The expressed nuclear threat was the most blatant and belligerent exposition from the North Korean regime on global stability in recent memory.  Raising the  threat to another level, Pyongyang also told foreign embassies that it could not guarantee their safety in the event of conflict.       In a speech to the National Defense University in Washington, United States Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel noted that the recent actions of the North Koreans ""present a real and clear danger.""  Meanwhile, Russian  foreign ministry spokesperson, Alexander Lukashevich, observed that North Korea's actions may very well foreclose the notion of multilateral negotiations .  He cast Pyongyang's attempts to violate decisions of the United Nations Security Council"" as  ""categorically unacceptable,"" and issued the following warning: ""This radically complicates, if it doesn't in practice shut off, the prospects for resuming six-party talks.""       On April 5, 2013, Western officials were confirming reports that North Korea had moved a medium-range missile, known as a Musudan or Nodong B, to its east coast. It was unknown if the move was to be interpreted as a threatening gesture , with a warhead mounted on the missile, or part of the preparations for test firing.  There was growing suspicion  that North Korea might, in fact, be preparing to carry out yet another missile test. It should be noted that while this Musudan/Nodong B missile has a range of around 3,000 kilometers (1,875 miles), which would put all of South Korea, Japan, and possibly the United States' territory of Guam in its range; however, there was no test history to ensure precision. As noted by  Greg Thielmann, a senior fellow at the Arms Control Association,  ""A missile that has never even had a flight test is not an operational system and is not a credible threat."" Of course,  a missile launch might be in the offing for the purpose of acquiring that test history.       By April 10, 2013, South Korean sources said that North Korea appeared to be preparing to launch the Musudan mid-range ballistic missile that had been moved to the east coast, and warned that North Korea might even be preparing the fire the Musudan simultaneously with shorter range Nodong and Scud missiles.  The missiles launch could conceivably coincide with the celebration of the birthday of Kim Il-sung, the country's founder.       Meanwhile, the rhetoric from North Korea continued to be bellicose with North Korean state media asserting that the scenario on the  Korean Peninsula situation was ""inching close to a thermonuclear war,""  and authorities in Pyongyang warning foreign nationals in  South Korea to evacuate from that country.  The Obama administration in the United States, via White House spokesperson, Jay Carney, characterized North Korea's statements as ""unhelpful.""  Carney continued, ""This kind of rhetoric will only further isolate North Korea from the international community and we continue to urge the North Korean leadership to heed President Obama's call to choose the path of peace and to come into compliance with its international obligations.""       It should be noted that the foreign ministers of the so-called G-8 countries -- the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy,  Canada, Japan, and Russia -- have condemned North Korea's recent actions, and warned of consequences in North Korea conducts either a missile launch or a nuclear test.  On April 12, 2013, United States Secretary of State John Kerry traveled to South Korea and accentuated this multilateral warning, saying ""If Kim Jong-Un decides to launch a missile, whether it is across the Sea of Japan or some other direction, he will be choosing willfully to ignore the entire international community.""       A day later, Secretary of State Kerry  met with Chinese leaders to find ways to end the geopolitical crisis brewing on the Korean peninsular.  Following that meeting, Secretary Kerry said that the United States and China were both calling for North Korea to refrain from further provocative actions. It was clear that the international community was united in its stance against North Korea's recent acts of dangerous provocation.       Secretary of State John Kerry ended his Asian trip with a call for negotiations to end the dissonance and emphasizing the imperative of finding  a diplomatic solution. He said, ""The United States remains open to authentic and credible negotiations on denuclearization, but the burden is on Pyongyang. North Korea must take meaningful steps to show that it will honor commitments it has already made, and it has to observe laws and the norms of international behavior.""       Meanwhile, with an eye on decreasing the tensions between the two Koreas, South Korean President Park Geun-hye called for peaceful dialogue.  But North  Korea was quick to reject the overture, characterizing the offer of talks as a  ""cunning ploy.""  If that response was any indication, North Korea remained defiant in the face of international pressure.       Latest Developments       April 15, 2013 -- the  anniversary of North Korea's founder's birth -- passed fairly quietly, without a continuation of the bellicose war threats and even free of a huge military parade showcasing North Korean military might.  The hopes that North Korea might be digesting the call for talks, and that the heated geopolitical climate had cooled for the moment, dissipated as Pyongyang issued new threats of war.  A statement via state-controlled media was issued as follows: ""Our retaliatory action will start without any notice from now.""       It should be noted that South Korea  responded to the recent actions of North Korea by deploying two warships with  the Aegis missile defense systems on the east and west coasts.  As well, Japan deployed missile defense systems around Tokyo to defend against any missile threat by North Korea.       In an interview with NBC News broadcast on April 16, 2013, United States President Barack Obama said that while the intelligence available does not suggest that North Korea has the ability to successfully arm a ballistic missile with nuclear warheads, he yet believed his country needed to be prepared for all possibilities.  He said,  ""Based on our current intelligence assessments we do not think that they have that capacity. But we have to make sure that we are dealing with every contingency out there.  That's why I repositioned missile defense systems: to guard against any miscalculation on their part.""       Asked whether he believed the  North Korean leader, Kim Jung-Un, was mentally unstable, President Obama responded, ""I'm not a psychiatrist. And I don't know the leader of North Korea.""   However, President Obama characterized  North Korea's exposition of bellicose and vituperative war rhetoric as being similar to a childish tantrum, and unlikely to yield productive results.  He said, ""You don't get to bang your spoon on the table and somehow you get your way.""       President Obama seemed cognizant of the fact that the impasse was unlikely to end easily, although he did not foreclose the possibility of a diplomatic resolution.  He mused, ""All of us would anticipate that North Korea will probably make more provocative moves over the next several weeks... This is the same kind of pattern that we saw his father engage in, and his grandfather before that. If they want to rejoin the community of nations, that path is available to them.""       On April 18, 2013, North Korea's National Defense Commission issued a statement via the official Korean Central News Agency, demanding that the United States and South Korea withdraw ""all nuclear war making capabilities from the region,"" with an eye on future dialogue.  North Korea also called for  Washington and Seoul to apologize for its  aggression.       In response, a spokesperson for the  White House, Josh Earnest,  said that the Obama administration was committed to denuclearization of the Korean peninsular and was open to ""authentic and credible negotiations.""  Earnest noted that the  actions and rhetoric from North Korea ""actually indicate the opposite.""  He added, ""We also need to see some clear evidence that the North Koreans themselves are willing to live up to their international obligations, are willing to demonstrate their commitment to ending the nuclear program, something they've promised in the past.""       By April 21, 2013, North Korea was reported to have moved  two short-range missile launchers to the east coast.  According to a South Korean military source in a report by the South Korean Yonhap news agency, satellite imagery showed the transfer of  two mobile missile launchers suitable for short-range Scud missiles to the South Hamgyeong province.  Earlier in the month, as noted above, two mid-range Musudan missiles were  place on launchers on the east coast.  Collectively, these actions indicated that a missile launch might be in the offing -- possibly to mark the  anniversary of the founding of the North Korean military on April 25.  However, that date passed without any show of force.       In the last week of April 2013, South Korea called on North Korea to engage in  dialogue over the Kaesong industrial complex, which became a flashpoint in the ongoing crisis between the two Koreas.  Regarded as a symbol of cooperation between North Korea and South Korea, the decision by the North to block access to the jointly-run industrial complex was interpreted as a clear sign of deteriorating relations, devolving diplomacy,  and the slide towards confrontation.  That slide became more precipitous when  North Korea outright rejected the invitation to engage in  talks.  South Korea, therefore, responded by withdrawing its nationals from the  Kaesong industrial zone in the interests of safety.       On May 6, 2013,  CBS News reported that the two Musudan medium-range missiles, which had been moved to the east coast of North Korea weeks prior, were now removed from the launch site. Those missiles, as discussed above,  had sufficient range to reach Japan as well as the United States territory of Guam in the Pacific.       The movement of the missiles was being interpreted in some circles as a cooling of the heated tensions on the Korean Peninsular. Of course, with the start of the spring farming season, it was also possible that many members of the army were -- as they do each year --  necessarily turning their attention to the planting effort.       Regardless of the rationale, the removal of the Musudan missiles from the launch site conceivably indicated that the threat posed by North Korea was reduced at this time, if only on a temporary basis.  Indeed, since the Musudan is a mobile missile, it could well be transported back to the launch site in short order.  As noted by a senior United States official from the National Security Council in an interview with BBC News, it was ""premature to celebrate it as good news,"" given North Korea's record of unpredictable behavior to date. Striking a similar tone, George Little, a Pentagon spokesperson,  characterized North Korea's most recent stance as ""a provocation pause.""       May 2013 saw North Korea carry out a series of short-range missile tests from its east coast.  As global leaders attempted to bring down the level of tensions on the Korean Peninsular,  and even after North Korea pulled back its two medium range missiles from its launch pad, the firing of four -- albeit short range -- missiles was being regarded as a provocation.  It was not known if North Korea was trying to re-ignite geo-political tensions or if the tests were routine exercises intended to simply show military might. Regardless, United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon  urged North Korea to refrain from carrying out any further missile tests and ""resume dialogue.""       Presumably in an effort to show that the United States was fully prepared to defend itself from the potential nuclear missile threat posed by North Korea or any other belligerent nation state, the Missile Defense Agency along with the United States Navy on May 16, 2013  completed a successful test of a missile defense system as it destroyed a target launched in the Pacific Ocean.  According to reports from the  Department of Defense, a short-range ballistic missile target was launched  from the Pacific Missile Range Facility on the Hawaiian island of Kauai;  the USS Lake Erie was able to  detect and track the missile, then launch a blocking missile with a kinetic warhead, which successfully destroyed the target.  United States officials said the test operation in Hawaii demonstrated that the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense system was fully functional.       Negotiations Planned and Canceled       On June 6, 2013, North Korea proposed convening talks with South Korea over the jointly-administered Kaesong industrial zone, which had been shut down months earlier amidst heightened tensions.  The proposal  also included a provision to restart tours at the Mount Kumgang resort, which was suspended when a South Korea tourist was shot by a North Korean guard in 2008.       In regards to the more recent closure of the industrial complex,  more than 50,000 North Korean workers at Kaesong were withdrawn and South Koreans and supplies were banned entry as part of North Korea's illustration that it was in a ""state of war"" with South Korea.  As intimated above in the ""Background"" note, the Kaesong complex has often been viewed as a symbol of cross-border cooperation between the two Koreas and its closure augured negatively as regards the overall geo-political security on the Korean Peninsular. But with North Korea's Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea offering the overture of dialogue on Kaeosong and Mount Kumgang,  it was believed that an effort was being made to de-escalate tensions and move to a more constructive footing.       North Korea's Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea issued the following statement outlining its proposal of dialogue: ""We propose holding talks between authorities of the North and South for the normalization of operations at Kaesong and the resumption of tours to Mount Kumgang on the occasion of the anniversary of the June 15 joint declaration.""  South Korea's Ministry of Unification, which administers inter-Korean affairs, said the government in Seoul was ""considering the proposal in a positive light."" Earlier, South Korea made it clear that given the precipitous and dangerous decline in bilateral relations during the first part of 2013, it would not only consider government level engagement with North Korea.       One day later on June 7, 2013, South Korea accepted North Korea's offer of bilateral talks but insisted that rather than have them take place in the  North Korean border town of Kaesong, that the dialogue site be in the  truce village of Panmunjom in the demilitarized zone between the countries.  South Korea also  noted that it was interested in taking up a range of issues, including the Kaesong Industrial Complex, the tourist center at Mount Kumgang, and the notion of family reunions.  The North reacted to South Korea's stance in a rare show of cordiality  asserting the following via a statement: ""We appreciate the fact that the South side promptly and positively responded to the proposal made by us for holding talks between the authorities of both sides.""       It should be noted that the North Korean government in Pyongyang also said that if Seoul accepted its proposal, it would also re-establish the emergency hotline channels, which were severed earlier in the year, as noted above.       But optimism about diplomatic progress between the two Koreas plummeted on June 11, 2013, when despite the fact that preliminary talks on technical and administrative details were reported to have gone smoothly.  By June 13, 2013, more details emerged related to the cancellation of the negotiations.  The cause was attributed to the composition of the respective delegations at the negotiating table in the first ministerial level talks since 2007.       Originally, South Korean Unification Minister Ryoo Kihl-jae was slated to lead South Korea's delegation.  When South Korea requested that North Korea send Kim Yang-gon, an adviser to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un,  to the talks, North Korea declined.  Seoul then decided to dispatch  Vice-Unification Minister Kim Nam-shik to lead its delegation instead.  North Korea took offense to the apparent ""downgraded"" level of South Korean officials present  at the talks  and decided to withdraw completely.  North Korea placed the blame on South Korea for ""arrogant obstruction"" and ""deliberate disturbance"" resulting in the aborted negotiations.  North Korea further characterized South Korea's decision to change the composition of its delegation in this manner as ""the height of discourtesy and disrespect unprecedented in the history of the North-South dialogue"".       For its part, South Korea  said it was disappointed with North Korea's response.  South Korea also made it clear that  it would not be offering to participate in negotiations with North Korea at any point in the near future.  As noted by South Korean Prime Minister Chung Hong-won: ""In the past, we have made infinite concessions to the North, but the time has come to hold talks where both sides are represented by officials of the same level.""       At the start of July 2013, relations between the two Koreas seemed to be moving in a more productive direction when North Korea agreed to hold talks on the Kaesong industrial complex, only hours after South Korea suggested  the meeting.  It was hoped that this overture would end more positively than the situation in June 2013 when the proposed Kaesong discussions were halted over procedural disagreements, as discussed just above.  However, as of mid-July 2013, there was no immediate agreement reached on resuming operations at their joint Kaesong industrial complex.       With relations between the two Koreas at a stalemate of sorts in mid-June 2013 (subsequently improved in early July 2013, as discussed above), it came as something of a surprise when North Korea proposed direct talks with the United States.  North Korea's  National Defense Commission, headed by North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un, said it hoped for ""serious discussions... to secure peace and stability.""  The United States responded to this overture by saying it looked towards  ""credible negotiations,"" made clear that North Korea had to be compliant with United Nations resolutions and travel down the path of denuclearization.   At the start of July 2013, North Korea renewed its push for engagement with the United States when Choi Myung-nam, an international affairs director at the North Korean Foreign Ministry, said Washington should take Pyongyang's diplomatic offers seriously. It should be noted that while representatives of the United States and North Korea have held meetings sporadically, the two sides have not  engaged in high-level talks since 2009.       Meanwhile, in the third week of June 2013, North Korea was apparently building on its sudden appetite for diplomatic engagement as it expressed an interest in restarting international nuclear negotiations.  According to  China's foreign ministry, North Korean officials were now indicating that they wanted to ""peacefully resolve the nuclear issue.""  It should be noted that multilateral talks between North Korea, South Korea, China, Japan, Russia, and the United States over North Korea's controversial nuclear program collapsed in 2008.  North Korea's renewed interest in diplomatic engagement at the multilateral level came as a result of high-level strategic talks with Chinese officials in Beijing. It was to be seen if an actual return to the multilateral negotiating table was in the offing.       In mid-August 2013,  the two Koreas were  able to successfully reach an agreement to re-open the jointly-administered Kaesong industrial complex.  The accord between the two countries included a provision ensuring that Pyongyang would never again shut the industrial complex -- often viewed as a symbol of cross-border cooperation --  ""under any circumstances.""  Another key provision of the accord was the move to  ""internationalize"" the Kaesong industrial complex by hosting foreign visitors at the factory park. This element would effectively make it harder for  North Korea to take any unilateral action involving the facility.  Left unspecified at the time was a precise date for the reopening of the facility and the resumption of regular operations.       By September 2013  the two Koreas agreed on a ""trial"" start date of Sept. 16, 2013.  It should be noted that agreement was also forged in regard to exempting South Korean firms from taxes for the rest of 2013  to offset losses incurred during the period of months when the complex was closed.  Agreement was also made to facilitate easier access to the complex for South Koreans carrying out commercial responsibilities, and for the purpose of attracting foreign investors to the Kaesong Industrial Complex.       Nuclear site activity --       In mid-2013, despite the overtures of diplomatic engagement to the United States, and a stated interest in returning to multilateral talks, satellite imagery depicting a North Korean test site indicated possible preparations for a possible test of a nuclear device in the future.  Researchers at John Hopkins University's North Korean Blog 38 Forum reported that satellite imagery of the Punggye-ri nuclear test site showed that some construction was being carried out the site where  North Korea conducted nuclear tests in 2009 and 2013. Researchers at John Hopkins University said: ""This activity appears to have begun by late April 2013 and gathered momentum over the next few months.""  While there was no conclusive sense of what the increased activity at the Punggye-ri nuclear test site really meant, the researchers suggested that the construction could simply be a matter of repairs, or preparations for a future test.  As stated in the Blog 37: ""These activities do not appear to be part of preparations for a nuclear test in the near-term. Rather, they seem to be long-term projects ... that may be necessary for the conduct of future tests.""       In September 2013,  signs pointed to the fact that operations were being restarted at North Korea's Yongbyon reactor.  Of note was the fact that white steam was seen rising from the Yongbyon nuclear facility.  According to the Blog 38 North website of the United States-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University, the color and volume of the steam signaled that the reactor was getting close to being operational.  The blog entry read as follows: ""The white coloration and volume are consistent with steam being vented because the electrical generating system is about to come online, indicating that the reactor is in or nearing operation,"" said the Washington-based institute.""  It seemed that regardless of calming of tensions, North Korea was going forward with the threat made in April 2013 about re-opening its Yongbyon facility.       As stated by Jeffrey Lewis of Blog 38 in an interview with BBC News, ""The reactor looks like it either is or will within a matter of days be fully operational, and as soon as that happens, it will start producing plutonium."" He continued, ""They really are putting themselves in a position to increase the amount of material they have for nuclear weapons, which I think gives them a little bit of leverage in negotiations, and adds a sense of urgency on our part.""   Still, that sense of urgency was a relative one with the Institution for Science and International Security issuing a report in which it would yet take time before North Korea could use new plutonium in nuclear weapons.  The institute's report issued the following finding: ""Given that North Korea will likely need two-three years before it discharges irradiated fuel containing plutonium and another six to 12 months to separate the plutonium, there remains time to negotiate a shutdown of the reactor before North Korea can use any of this new plutonium in nuclear weapons.""

According to  Panamanian President Ricardo Martinelli, the ship was targeted by drug enforcement officials as it  traveled from Cuba and approached the Panama Canal. Of concern to the Panamanian authorities was the fact that the ship disappeared from satellite tracking systems after it left the Caribbean side of the Panama Canal. This situation raised the suspicions of Panamanian authorities who wondered why the ship's crew would de-activate the tracking system that conveys details of the vessel's location.       As stated by Panamanian President Ricardo Martinelli, ""We had suspected this ship, which was coming from Cuba and headed to North Korea, might have drugs aboard so it was brought into port for search and inspection."" When the vessel, Chong Chon Gang, was taken into port and subject to search and inspection, its  cargo of suspected missiles was uncovered. Of note was the fact that the weapons were discovered amidst a shipment of sugar.       The drama in the Panama Canal reached new heights, according to Panamanian President Martinelli, when the North Korean ship captain had a heart attack and tried to commit suicide, while a riot involving the ship's crew of 35 ensued.  The entire crew was subsequently taken into custody while the vessel and its shipments were seized. As well, President  Martinelli posted an image via his Twitter account depicting a large green object inside a cargo container, which he characterized as the suspected ""sophisticated missile equipment.""        Soon after the fracas unfolded, Cuba admitted that this stash of weapons was included in its shipment of 10,000 tonnes of sugar to North Korea.  Cuba explained that the weapons were obsolete Soviet-era arms from Cuba  being sent for repair in North Korea.  That explanation was plausible since North Korea possesses some expertise in the weapons arena. However, Panama called on the United Nations to lead an inquiry into the weapons materials to determine precisely what was stashed in the shipment.       Under the aegis of prevailing  United Nations sanctions, the transportation of all weapons to or from North Korea is prohibited.  Moreover, even a benign matter such as the transportation of weapons for repair to North Korea  would, nonetheless,  require a waiver from the United Nations Security Council.  It would seem that no such waiver was procured by Cuba or North Korea.       As well, regulations pertaining to the transfer of shipments through the Panama Canal required the declaration of military cargo, including  so-called ""obsolete"" weapons. Thus, an investigation into the matter was  underway, while the North Korean crew was faced with the prospect of charges of illegal weapons smuggling in Panama. As noted by President Martinelli, ""The world needs to sit up and take note: you cannot go around shipping undeclared weapons of war through the Panama Canal.""       It should be noted that North Korea issued a demand that its ship be returned and the crew of the Chong Chon Gang be released.  Panama was not acquiescing to this demand and, instead, was moving forward with the aforementioned investigation.       By the close of July 2013, woes for Cuba and North Korea over the infamous ship carrying weapons cargo only increased.  At issue was the report by Panamanian authorities that four new undeclared containers were found aboard the  Chong Chon Gang, quite likely in  violation of United Nations sanctions.  That determination, however, was yet to be made.       In February 2014 ,  Panama had released the  Chong Chon Gang and the  ship's owner was forced to pay a fine totalling almost $700,000 for violating navigation regulations (specifically those attending to the transporation of weapons).  As well,  three crew members were facing weapons trafficking charges, although the charges against the other 32 crew members were dropped.        At issue for the Panamanian government was the fact that the weapons  being smuggled were not ""obsolete defensive weapons"" as claimed by Cuba, but in fact several sophisticated weapons in perfect condition.  Indeed, it was soon revealed that the stash of weapons included two MiG-21 aircraft, 15 MiG engines and nine anti-aircraft missiles.       A preliminary report  by a panel of experts to the Sanctions Committee at the United Nations Security Council concluded that the Chong Chon Gang  violated prevailing United Nations sanctions against North Korea, which ban the transfer of weapons to that country.   Yet to be determined would be the type of penalties the United Nations Security Council would levy against Cuba.        ***       Special Entry

Satellite photos indicate North Korea producing fuel rods for nuclear reactor at Yongbyon --      On Dec. 24, 2013, the United States-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University in Washington D.C. reported that satellite imagery indicated that North Korea was producing fuel rods for its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon.       Months earlier in September 2013,  amidst progress on the diplomatic front as the two Koreas agreed to re-open operations at the jointly-administered Kaesong industrial complex, there was retrenchment on the matter of North Korea's nuclear program.  There were indications that operations were being restarted at North Korea's Yongbyon reactor. Of note was the fact that white steam was seen rising from the Yongbyon nuclear facility.        According to the Blog 38 North website of the United States-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University, the color and volume of the steam signaled that the reactor was getting close to being operational.  The blog entry read as follows: ""The white coloration and volume are consistent with steam being vented because the electrical generating system is about to come online, indicating that the reactor is in or nearing operation,"" said the Washington-based institute.""  It seemed that regardless of calming of tensions, North Korea was going forward with the threat made in April 2013 about re-opening its Yongbyon facility.      As stated by Jeffrey Lewis of Blog 38 in an interview with BBC News in September 2013, ""The reactor looks like it either is or will within a matter of days be fully operational, and as soon as that happens, it will start producing plutonium."" He continued, ""They really are putting themselves in a position to increase the amount of material they have for nuclear weapons, which I think gives them a little bit of leverage in negotiations, and adds a sense of urgency on our part.""         Still, that sense of urgency was a relative one with the Institution for Science and International Security issuing a report in which it would yet take time before North Korea could use new plutonium in nuclear weapons.  The institute's report issued the following finding: ""Given that North Korea will likely need two-three years before it discharges irradiated fuel containing plutonium and another six to 12 months to separate the plutonium, there remains time to negotiate a shutdown of the reactor before North Korea can use any of this new plutonium in nuclear weapons.""      But as of late December 2013, clearly no ""shutdown"" of the reactor was in the immediate offing.  Instead, the United States-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University was  reporting that satellite imagery showed that North Korea was producing fuel rods for its Yongbyon nuclear reactor.  The United States-Korea Institute  further concluded that one building at Yonbyon had been renovated to produce fresh fuel rods for the reactor, which appeared to be operational.  As well, another building was identified which could be used to produce fuel for a light-water reactor.        Via the Blog 38 North website, the United States-Korea Institute offered the following  assessment: ""The identification of these facilities indicates a more wide-ranging, extensive effort by North Korea to modernize and restart the Yongbyon complex."" The institute continued, ""Based on this analysis, it appears the North Koreans anticipated that future requirement before 2009 and knew the lead times required to produce the necessary fresh fuel. Once international inspectors were expelled in 2009, they moved forward with the renovation of the main pilot plant building as part of what was likely their contingency plan for reactivation.""      The ""good news"" for neighboring countries anxious about a nuclear-armed North Korea was the belief that Pyongyang holds possession of only 25 percent of the fuel rods necessary for the reactor to reach full power.      ***      Special Entry:      North Korea and South Korea exchange fire following North Korean threat of another nuclear test      On Feb. 27, 2014, North Korea fired four short-range missiles over the sea off its eastern coast -- essentially to the north of the border with South Korea. The South Korea Yonhap News Agency speculated that the missiles were Scud short-range missiles with a  capacity of traversing 125 miles and thus capable of reaching targets in South Korea but not as far as Japan.

On March 2, 2014, North Korea fired another two short-range missiles into the sea off the eastern coast of the Korean peninsula.  The South Korea Yonhap news Agency reported that the missiles likely flew about 300 miles and were believed to be  Scud-C models -- this time capable of reaching targets in both South Korea and Japan.     In the third week of March 2014, North Korea fired  a series of 30 short-range rockets into the sea off the eastern end of the Korean peninsula. The rockets were thought to be Soviet-era FROG rockets that have been in North Korea's possession since the 1960s, and seemingly flew for more than 35 miles before landing in the sea.  This launch of the 30 FROG missiles came after other such missile tests in the weeks prior, as discussed above.     In the last week of March 2014, North Korea test fired two medium range Nodong missiles, which landed in the ocean between North Korea and Japan.  The action essentially triggered a condemnation from the United Nations Security Council, which noted that the missile launches were a violation of prevailing United Nations resolutions, such as  Security Council Resolutions 1718  and  1874 that prohibit North Korea from carrying out ballistic or nuclear activity.  The United Nations Security Council also warned  of an ""appropriate response"" to come.  Undeterred, North Korea lashed back at the United Nations Security Council, characterizing its condemnation as  ""absolutely intolerable"" and justifying its own action as being a ""self-defensive"" move.     There were suggestions that North Korea was reacting to the  annual joint military exercises by United States and South Korean forces, which Pyongyang typically characterizes as acts of war and aggression.  Fueling the fire for North Korea was the flight of a United States nuclear-capable B-52 bomber  over South Korea.  South Korean authorities have put forth the theory that North Korea's missile launched constituted an ""armed protest"" against the joint South Korean-United States military drills that were taking place.     Perhaps exasperated by North Korea's provocative acts and  saber rattling, which were manifest most recently by the missile launches, China had already entered the equation.  Even before the launch of the medium range missiles in the last week of March 2014,  China hard earlier  declared a ""red line,"" saying that it would not allow  war or chaos on  the Korean peninsula, and  asserting that peace was possible only  via  denuclearization. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi was on the record saying, ""The Korean peninsula is right on China's doorstep. We have a red line, that is, we will not allow war or instability on the Korean peninsula."" Wang demanded that  all parties  ""exercise restraint"" and noted that ""genuine and lasting peace"" on the Korean peninsula was only possible with denuclearization.  He said, ""Confrontation can only bring tension, and war can only cause disaster.""  The Chinese foreign minister also endorsed the resumption of multilateral nuclear talks, saying, ""Some dialogue is better than none, and better early than later.""     This stance by China -- North Korea's most  important diplomatic and economic supporter -- suggested that Beijing was no longer willing to accept Pyongyang's theatrics on its doorstep.   Pressure on North Korea had already begun to intensify a month earlier in February 2014 when the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, urged global powers  to refer North Korea to the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court following a report that documented horrific crimes against humanity in that country.   While China was unlikely to join the human rights chorus against North Korea, it certainly seemed prepared to use its influence to compel  North Korea to return to the nuclear negotiating table.  Adding to the suggestion that dialogue might be at hand, Japan and North Korea were scheduled to engage in their first high level talks in years.     However, the nuclear negotiating table appeared to be a distant notion as March 2014 came to a close, and as North Korea threatened to go forward with a nuclear test.  As reported by the North Korean Central News Agency, North Korea said it would not foreclose the possibility of testing a ""new form"" nuclear weapon in defiance of international condemnation and in contravention of prevailing international law. While Pyongyang did not specify the type of nuclear weaponry it intended to test, the conventional wisdom has long been  held that North Korea was attempting to develop small and sophisticated nuclear devices that could be delivered by intercontinental ballistic missiles.     South Korea warned that if its neighbor to the north went forward with a nuclear test, there would be consequences in the offing.  As noted by South Korea Foreign Ministry spokesman Cho Tae-young, ""North Korea should bear in mind that if it ignores the stern demand from the neighboring countries and the international community and carries out a nuclear test, it will have to pay a price for it.""     On March 31, 2014, tensions on the Korean peninsula exponentially increased as North Korea and South Korea exchanged fire across its western maritime border.     According to South Korean authorities, this exchange of fire was presaged by North Korea's announcement that it would hold ""live fire"" military drills along its border zone with South Korea.  South Korea warned that there would be immediate retaliation if any ordinance touched its jurisdiction.  North Korea then fired more than 500 artillery rounds, some 100 of which landed in South Korean territorial waters.  As promised,  the South Koreans responded by firing  more than 300 rounds into  North Korean waters and scrambling F-15s on its side of the maritime border.     Known as the Northern Limit Line, the maritime border has been a well known flashpoint region between the two Koreas, and its very existence is a matter of dispute from the point of view of the North Koreans. The boundary was established after the end of the Korean War in the 1950s by the United Nations, but the line of demarcation has been accepted by North Korea.   It should be noted that North Korean artillery fire killed four South Koreans on the Yeonpyeong border island in the same disputed area in 2010.  In another egregious incident in 2010, North Korea torpedoed a South Korean warship in the disputed border region, sinking the vessel and killing 46 people.  Now, in 2014, it was again the locus of dissonance between the two Koreas as a result of the North's decision to hold military drills in this hotspot region.     It was to be seen if these were actions by North Korea were aimed at improving Pyongyang's negotiating position for the future as it attempted to stave off further sanctions that were likely to come, or, if they were intended to be blatant and irrational acts of provocation.  South Korean Defence Ministry spokesperson,  Kim Min-seok, intimated that Pyongyang's actions were being motivated by both factors as he said, ""We believe the North's maritime firing is a planned provocation and an attempt to test our military's determination to defend the Northern Limit Line and to get an upper hand in South-North relations.""     *** Note:  See below for  information on North Korea's nuclear test history, nuclear capability, and the United States' reaction to the threat posed by North Korea to its national security. ***     ***     Special Entry     North Korea test fires missiles ahead of South Korean visit by Chinese president     On July 2, 2014, North Korea fired a series of short-range rockets into the sea off its east coast. While the type of rockets could not be confirmed by South Korean sources that reported the event, they surmised that they were likely 300 mm rockets. Days earlier, North Korea fired two short range ballistic missiles.  It should be noted that while the short range rocket launch were not in violation of prevailing United Nations Security Council resolutions against North Korea, the firing of short range  ballistic missiles were, indeed, in violation of international law.     The apparent display of military might by North Korea came ahead of a visit by  Chinese President Xi Jinping to South Korea.  It was not known if the test firing of missiles was intended to intimidate China, which is North Korea's only major ally and home to a own far more sophisticated military. But with China being pressured by South Korea and the West to use its influence to curb North Korea's provocative actions, and return to the negotiating table as regards its nuclear and missile program, it was possible that North Korea was delivering the message that it would not be swayed by its closest ally, especially when that ally's leader was on a formal visit to South Korea.  In truth, Chinese   President Xi Jinping  was returning the courtesy of a visit to China by South Korean President Park Geun-hye; however, it was not likely that paranoid Pyongyang would interpret the visit in the most benign manner.     North Korea fires three short-range rockets ahead of Pope Francis' visit to South Korea     In mid-August 2014, North Korea fired three short range rockets from the port city of Wonsan; the rockets landed in the sea off the east coast of the Korean peninsula.  The incident coincided with Pope Francis' arrival in South Korea for a five day visit and ahead of scheduled joint military exercises between South Korea and the United States.  North Korea objects to those drills, charging that they are intended to prepare for war.  As such, North Korea has typically taken some sort of provocative action to protest the joint military activity.  In this case, North Korea reacted with the firing of the rockets as well as the issuance of a statement that read as follows: ""Given that the U.S. and the puppet forces of South Korea continue staging nuclear war exercises against us in particular, we will take countermeasures for self-defense which will include missile launches, nuclear tests, and all other programs.""  It was to be seen if North Korea would indeed follow up the rocket launches with nuclear tests, as indicated.

*** Note:  See below for  information on North Korea's nuclear test history, nuclear capability, and the United States' reaction to the threat posed by North Korea to its national security. ***    ***    Special Note    United States slaps sanctions on North Korea in response to alleged cyber-attack on Sony    At the start of 2015, the United States imposed new sanctions on North Korea in response to an alleged cyber-attack on  Sony Pictures Entertainment.  Of note was the fact that United States sanctions against North Korea were already in place as a result of Pyongyang's provocative and dangerous nuclear program.  This new tranche of sanctions was being imposed as a retributive  measure promised by the Obama White House in response to a cyber-attack on Sony Pictures, which the United States government charged was carried out by agents of North Korea. While some cyber-experts have cast doubts on the claim that North Korea was behind the cyber-attack, the United States government has held steadfastly to that claim.     The cyber-attack on Sony Pictures began when the so-called Guardians of Peace hacked and released data from Sony's computers, exposing embarrassing electronic mail correspondence. The group soon took its attack to new heights, threatening theaters intending to screen Sony's satirical comedy, The Interview, which featured a humorous assassination plot against the leader of North Korea. Those threats caused Sony to cancel its cinema release of the movie, ultimately earning the rebuke of United States President Obama who suggested that decision by Sony was ""a mistake.""  To that end, Sony later reversed its decision and    released the film in some theaters and in online formats.    Meanwhile, North Korea's response to the hacking drama plaguing Sony was confusing.  Powers in that country at first praised the cyber-attack, casting it as a ""righteous deed,""  and even implying it might be the work of its own agents; later,  they denied culpability altogether.  However, as noted above, the United States made clear that it placed the blame for the Sony cyber-attack on North Korea, with Obama administration officials warning of  a ""proportional response"" in the offing.    By late 2014, there was speculation that a disruption or ""blackout"" of Internet service in North Korea may have been part of the package of consequences promised by the Obama administration against North Korea.  However, the United States government refused to acknowledge whether or not it was responsible for cutting off Internet connectivity in North Korea.     By contrast, at the start of 2015, the Treasury Department in the United States was utterly forthright  when it publicly named  three entities as well as 10 North Korean government officials in its  sanctions announcement.  The United States Treasury's list of targets included  individuals working in Iran, Syria, China, Russia and Namibia. The three entities covered by the sanctions were as follows: The Reconnaissance General Bureau -- North Korea's primary intelligence organization; the Korea Mining Development Trading Corporation (Komid) -- North Korea's primary arms dealer; and Korea Tangun Trading Corporation -- a defense research  agency.  It should be noted that the targets of the new sanctions were not necessarily linked to the cyber-hacking attack on Sony Pictures.  Instead, it appeared that the United States was simply augmenting its sanctions regime already in place against North Korea.  The intent was to isolate North Korea's defense industry as a deterrent against future cyber-attacks.    For his part, President Barack Obama signed an executive order on Jan. 2, 2015, officializing the sanctions, while the White House released a statement that read as follows:  ""We take seriously North Korea's attack that aimed to create destructive financial effects on a U.S. company and to threaten artists and other individuals with the goal of restricting their right to free expression. Today's actions are the first aspect of our response.""  The White House added,  ""This step reflects the ongoing commitment of the United States to hold North Korea accountable for its destabilizing, destructive and repressive actions, particularly its efforts to undermine U.S. cyber-security and intimidate U.S. businesses and artists exercising their right of freedom of speech.""    ***    Special Note    U.S. Ambassador to South Korea brutally attacked; North Korea calls the violence justified    In the first week of March 2015, United States Ambassador Mark Lippert was brutally attacked by a pro-North Korean activist in the South Korean capital of Seoul.     Ambassador Lippert, who was serving as the United States envoy to South Korea, was attending a breakfast aimed at a discussion of the reunification of the two Koreas. During the breakfast, the assailant pushed Lippert onto a table and slashed his face with a knife, seriously injuring him.  The ambassador was then rushed to the hospital and endured 80 stitches and several hours of surgery to close his facial wound. South Korean doctors later said that Lippert narrowly survived the injury.    The assailant was soon identified as as pro-North Korean activist,  Kim Ki-jong, who was known to authorities due to a previous attempt to attack Japanese Ambassador Toshinori Shigeie, for which he received only a suspended sentence. As well, there was a long record of Kim Ki-jong's participation in anti-American protests.   In South Korea, activists with pro-Pyongyang sensibilities are few in number; however, they hold passionate beliefs about the contribution of foreign powers to the divisions between the Koreas.       South Korean  President Park Guen-hye condemned what she cast as an ""attack on the South Korea-U.S. alliance.""  However, the incident did not reflect well on her, the South Korean government, or South Korean security authorities. Indeed, there were vital questions arising about (1) the level of security at the high-level breakfast, and (2) the fact that the assailant -- with his known history -- was not only free, but permitted to attend a diplomatic breakfast attended by high ranking officials.    Meanwhile, North Korea entered the fray, lauding the act of violence and characterizing it as ""just punishment for U.S. warmongers.""  On behalf of the United States, Secretary of State John Kerry asserted that his country  would not be ""intimidated or deterred by threats or by anybody who harms any American diplomats.""  For his part, Ambassador Lippert exhibited great resilience, writing after surgery via the social media outlet, Twitter,   ""Doing well and in great spirits... Will be back ASAP to advance US-ROK [Republic of Korea] alliance!""    ***

Special Note   Talks between two Koreas ends in agreement to de-escalate tensions after exchange of fire and North Korean move to ""war footing""   On Aug. 20, 2015, North Korea shelled across the border, prompting South Korea to retaliate with several rounds of artillery fire.   Reports indicated that North Korea carried out the initial burst of shelling in retaliation for anti-Pyongyang rhetoric that has been broadcast on loudspeakers from South Korea.  The broadcasts have generally be regarded as a type of psychological warfare against Pyongyang and intended to counteract the North's nationalist propaganda.   South Korea responded to North Korea's shelling, as noted here, by firing rounds of artillery.  North Korea did not immediately return fire, opting instead to warn South Korea to cease its broadcasts, which it viewed as a declaration of war, along the border area within 48 hours. North Korea warned that if South Korea did not heed its warning, it would take military action.  However, South Korean authorities said that the broadcasts would not be stopped, thus prompting the exchange of multiple rounds of fire -- none of which ended at this time with  any casualties.   The exchange of fire came after two South Korean soldiers died in a landmine blamed on  North Korea earlier in August 2015, and before annual joint military exercises between the United States and South Korea that North Korea regularly condemns as an act of aggression. As a result of these incidents and the impending joint military exercises, tensions were now markedly intensified between the two Koreas.  Given this unstable landscape,  South Korea moved to evacuate residents from   Yeoncheon in  the western sea  border. South Korea's National Security Council was also set to convene an emergency session.   Then, on Aug. 21, 2015,  in a disturbing escalation of tensions, the  North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, placed his country on ""war footing."" North Korean state media reported that after an emergency meeting of the central military commission, King Jong-un had ordered that North Korean troops be ""fully ready for any military operations at any time.""  While North Korea has often indulged in fiery militaristic rhetoric, this instance was regarded as more alarming since an exchange of fire had just taken place.   On Aug. 23, 2015, South Korean President Park Geun-hye released a statement in which she said that the anti-Pyongyang broadcasts would continue unless North Korea apologized for the landmine incident that killed two South Korean soldiers.  She said, ""We need a clear apology and measures to prevent a recurrence of these provocations and tense situations. Otherwise, this government will take appropriate steps and continue loudspeaker broadcasts.""  The program of cross-border broadcasts actually ended in 2004 but resumed in recent times as a result of North Korean aggression.  It was to be seen  how North Korea would respond to the South Korean leader's demand, and if  high level bilateral talks between the two sides -- presumably with an eye on decreasing tensions -- would yield productive results.    A day later on Aug. 24, 2015, following marathon negotiations between the two Koreas in the in the so-called  ""truce village"" of Panmunjom inside the demilitarized zone (DMZ), the two Koreas released a statement indicating they had reached an agreement to de-escalate tensions.  According to the statement, North Korea expressed ""regret"" over the deaths of two South Korean soldiers in the aforementioned landmine incident, stopping just short of taking responsibility for the loss of life.  North Korea also agreed to end its war footing, which had actually commenced in earnest.  For its part, South Korea agreed to end its cross-border loudspeaker broadcasts.  Also of note was the fact that North Korea and South Korea agreed to future  discussions on a range of issues, with an eye on diffusing tensions and improving bilateral ties.   The agreement could only be regarded as a positive development on the Korean peninsula, especially given the volatile personality of nuclear-armed North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un.  But Pyongyang officially applauded the agreement, with the state news agency noting that it had moved the  inter-Korean relations from a catastrophic path  on to ""the track of reconciliation and trust."" North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un, also lauded the accord between the two Koreas, calling it  ""a landmark occasion.""    On the other side of the border, South Korean President Park Geun-hye enjoyed a political boost from her handling of the North Korean crisis, according to survey data that showed a spike in her job  approval rating.   Of significance was the fact that the 1950-1953 war between the two Koreas ended with an armistice and not a peace treaty . As such, any escalation of tensions or movement to military action is generally regarded with gravity and alarm by countries of the region of eastern Asia.

***  Special Entry  New activity detected at North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear site; Pyongyang confirms resumption of nuclear operations and warns of attack on U.S. --  Only weeks after North Korea and South Korea reached an agreement to tamp down cross-border hostilities, evidence of activity at North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear site was emerging.  At issue in mid-September 2015 were reports from the Johns Hopkins University's 38 North Blog, which monitors North Korea, that concluded that there was fresh activity taking place at two areas of Yongbyon -- specifically, at the 5 MWe reactor hall  and at the  Radiochemical laboratory, both of which are central sites in the  production of plutonium needed for the manufacture of nuclear weapons.  Of note was satellite imagery  indicating increased movement of  vehicles  around the 5 MWe reactor hall, as evidenced by heavy tire tracks around the ground floor of the building.  The imagery depicted tracks leading to the spent-fuel receiving building where nuclear fuel enters the reprocessing facility, and others tracks around  the support building where trucks would unload their materials.  There was also imagery at the Radiochemical laboratory where plutonium is chemically separated from uranium and other radioactive materials, for the purpose of building nuclear weapons.  As would be expected, the kind of activity at the  5 MWe reactor hall  and at the  Radiochemical laboratory in Yongbyon raised alarm bells across the globe.  While it remained impossible to determine whether Pyongyang was producing plutonium and  no conclusion could be drawn regarding the reason for increased  activity in Yongbyon,  the information nonetheless left the international community concerned that North Korea was increasing its weapons building capacity.  There remained a remote possibility that the activity could be due to renovations or maintenance; there was also a possibility that North Korea was replacing  contaminated equipment from the 5 MWe reactor and transporting it to the reprocessing complex for decontamination. Nevertheless, the general consensus was that Pyongyang was, more than likely,  ramping up its nuclear production and further developing its stockpile of nuclear weapons.  As noted by Director General Yukiya Amano of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), ""These [activities] appear to be broadly consistent with the DPRK's statements that it is further developing its nuclear capabilities.""  On Sept. 15, 2015, Pyongyang removed all doubt about its nuclear activities, confirming that the Yongbyon nuclear site had indeed resumed operation.  The reactor at Yongbyon provided plutonium for North Korea's nuclear weapons program but was shut down in 2007.  In 2013, following North Korea's third nuclear test, the government in Pyongyang made clear that the reactor would be restarted.  Now, in 2015, it was apparent that Pyongyang was making good on that threat.   According to the state-run news agency, known by the acronym, KCNA, North Korea was aiming to increase its nuclear weapons arsenal and improve the quality of nuclear weapons in its possession.  With North Korea already in possession of approximately 12 atomic bombs, nuclear weapons experts surmise that now that the reactor at Yongbyan has resumed operations, the North could conceivably produce enough plutonium for one nuclear bomb each year.  Of significance, though was the fact that those bombs were unlikely to be small enough to be fit a nuclear warhead, although there were recent claims to the contrary by Pyongyang (as discussed directly below).  It should be noted that North Korea was not simply delivering the message that it was expanding its nuclear weapons stockpile.  North Korea was also making an explicit threat to use its nuclear bombs to attack enemy states; to that end, North Korea asserted that it would face hostility from the United States ""with nuclear weapons any time.""  That particular threat was to be understood along with North Korean claims that it had effectively manufactured a device small enough to fit a nuclear warhead  on a missile that presumably could be launched at the will of the leadership in  Pyongyang.   There remained, however,  skepticism regarding the North's actual progress in regard to miniaturization.    Distance is another key consideration.  As has been the case in the past, North Korea's threats to attack the United States was being interpreted in the context of the plausibility.  Could a North Korean missile actually reach American soil?  While a missile could certainly reach South Korea, there were question marks about it reaching a longer distance.  For example, the medium-range missile, known as a Musudan or Nodong B  has a range of around 3,000 kilometers (1,875 miles), which would put all of South Korea, Japan, and possibly the United States' territory of Guam in its range.  But since there was no  test history to ensure precision (an issue addressed below), such a threat had to be regarded with some skepticism.   As noted by  Greg Thielmann, a senior fellow at the Arms Control Association,  ""A missile that has never even had a flight test is not an operational system and is not a credible threat.""  With this fact in mind,  the successful launch of a missile was unlikely to transpire without testing of the type that would be discernible to the entire world.  While that knowledge should ideally calm immediate anxieties about global stability,  the news that  North Korea intended to launch a rocket to transport its Songun Korea satellite into space was being received with alarm.   Typically, North Korea's  space and satellite announcements  function as a ruse for its nuclear military activities.  Specifically, North Korean claims of satellites being launched into space have long been  interpreted as euphemisms for  long-range missile tests.   North Korea has in its possession the long-range Unha rocket, which was launched into space in 2012 but billed as a satellite.  All signs pointed to a repeat test of this type --  regardless of the fact that North Korea was prohibited from conducting ballistic missile technology tests under prevailing United Nations Security Council Resolutions.   Given North Korea's record of defiance in regard to international law, there was little chance that warnings would stop Pyongyang from going down the road of a long-range missile test.  To be determined was the matter of whether or not North Korea's rocket technology was sufficiently advanced as to be able to strike Hawaii or the western coast of the mainland United States.  With the  70th anniversary of the foundation of the ruling Workers Party in the offing, this collective news about North Korea's nuclear activity and ambitions sparked the anxiety of the world, which was now bracing for another provocative act by Pyongyang.  ***  Special Report:     North Korea underlines role as global security pariah with long range missile test on the heels of alleged hydrogen bomb test  In January 2016, North Korea claimed to have successfully carried out  its first underground test of a hydrogen bomb at its Punggye-ri nuclear site.  A significant 5.1 magnitude tremor was detected in the region, with monitors quickly noting that it was not caused by natural seismic activity.  Pyongyang soon released a statement via state media, which declared: ""The republic's first hydrogen bomb test has been successfully performed at 10:00 am on Jan. 6, 2016.""  North Korean state media went on to make claims about the development in strident propaganda-laced language, as  it added:  ""People of the DPRK are making a giant stride, performing eye-catching miracles and exploits day by day.""  It should be noted that a hydrogen bomb test would indicate a marked augmentation of North Korea's nuclear capabilities, were it to be confirmed.  However, nuclear experts quickly discounted North Korea's claim, pointing to the fact that the blast was not large enough to be an actual thermonuclear explosion.   In an interview with BBC News,  James Acton,  one of the directors of the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said of the blast, ""It tentatively appears too small to be a hydrogen bomb.""  Likewise, in an interview with international media, Bruce Bennett, a defense analyst with the Rand Corporation, made the following observation:  ""The bang they should have gotten would have been 10 times greater than what they're claiming.""  Bennet also noted that if a full thermonuclear device was utilized by North Korea, the blast should have generated a seismic measurement of ""around seven on the earthquake scale.""  The general consensus seemed to be that North Korea had not tested a  genuine thermonuclear device, but very  likely utilized modifications and tested a boosted fission device.  But North Korea had also claimed that its device was miniaturized.  It should be noted that there was little information available to either prove or disprove North Korea's miniaturization claims.  That aspect could potentially be alarming for the global community since a nuclear device needs to be small enough to be fitted onto a missile for delivery purposes (vis a vis ground launchers which would have a more limited delivery capability).  A hydrogen bomb should be distinguished from an atomic bomb as the former uses fusion technology and would be capable of far more damage and decimation that an atomic bomb, which uses fission technology.    Of course, it should be noted that even an atomic bomb would be capable of catastrophic destruction, as evidenced by the horrific effects of the atomic bombs that struck the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II.   Since then, the very threat of any country using a nuclear bomb has been the most pressing global security concern, which guides international policy-making.  The Obama administration in the United States wasted no time in casting doubt on North Korea's claim of  a successful hydrogen bomb test.   While State Department spokesperson,  John Kirby, said, ""The U.S. government judges North Korea to have conducted a nuclear test yesterday,""  he indicated that  analysis indicated that the test was not actually that of  a hydrogen bomb.   White House spokesperson,  Josh Earnest,  emphasized that his country had no reason to change its view of the threat posed by North Korea.  Indeed, he essentially suggested that there was no reason to believe that North Korea actually had made notable strides in nuclear technology to the extent that it was now capable of producing and testing a hydrogen bomb.  He said,  ""Nothing that has occurred in the last 24 hours has caused the United States government to change our assessment of North Korea's technical and military capabilities.""  Even if the test was not that of a true hydrogen bomb, it would nevertheless mark the fourth nuclear test carried out by North Korea since 2006 and could only be understood as a blatant act of defiance,  a flagrant violation of existing United Nations Security Council Resolutions against North Korea, and a grave threat to global security.  There was no shortage of condemnation from the international community.  United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon characterized North Korea's latest nuclear test  as ""deeply troubling"" and warned that it was ""profoundly destabilizing for regional security.""  Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said that the nuclear test  also constituted a violation of international law, as he added, ""This test once again violates numerous Security Council resolutions despite the united call by the international community to cease such activities.""  South Korea blasted North Korea for  challenging global peace and violating international law.  Japan's government said the test was a threat to Japan and could not be tolerated.   Russia's ambassador to the United Nations, Vitaly Churkin, said that his country was hoping that  ""cool heads"" would prevail  and that Russia would recommend a ""proportionate response"" to the nuclear test.   China -- North Korea's closest ally -- said that it ""firmly opposed"" the test and noted that it occurred ""irrespective of the international community's opposition.""  Precisely because of its position as North Korea's closest ally, all eyes were on China, hoping that country could make progress communicating with the difficult North Korean regime.   However, China seemed to sidestep that responsibility, with its Foreign Ministry simply urging North Korea to adhere to its denuclearization promises and avoiding further provocative action.  A statement from that ministry read as follows: ""Achieving denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and safeguarding the peninsula's peace and stability accords with all parties' mutual interests, is the responsibility of all parties, and requires all parties to put forth efforts.""  The United States reacted to that statement by urging China to relinquish its ""business as usual"" relationship with North Korea and with United States Secretary of State John Kerry making the following statement in a news conference:  ""China had a particular approach that it wanted to make, that we agreed and respected to give them space to implement that,"" Kerry told reporters after the phone call. ""Today, in my conversation with the Chinese, I made it very clear that has not worked and we cannot continue business as usual.""  Not surprisingly, the broader international community made clear that North Korea would suffer consequences.  To this end, the United Nations Security Council issued a condemnation of North Korea, excoriating that country for being  ""a clear threat to international peace and security"" and saying  it would prepare a new tranche of punitive measures to be levied against North Korea for its latest act of belligerence.  Those news punitive measures would very likely come in the form of a new Security Council resolution.  That action was strongly backed by Japan, with the Japanese ambassador to the United Nations, Motohide Yoshikawa, saying,  ""The authority and credibility of the Security Council will be put in question if it does not take these measures.""   In an address to the United Nations Security Council, United States Ambassador  Samantha Power urged the body to impose ""a tough, comprehensive, and credible package of new sanctions,"" and  to ensure ""rigorous enforcement of the resolutions it has already adopted.""  Meanwhile, individual countries were wasting no time in taking unilateral action against North Korea.  At the top of the list of those countries was South Korea, which vowed that it would resume its frontier broadcasts of propaganda to the North in retaliation for its latest nuclear test.  It should be noted that the broadcasts have been the source of grave tensions between the two Koreas, leading to the deterioration of already-dismal ties between the two countries in recent times.    South Korea also increased in military readiness,  raised in cyber attack alert level, and canceled tours of the  Demilitarized Zone on the border.  Cho Tae-yong, a South Korean national security official,  warned that his country was ready to react to further provocations and acts of belligerence by the North as he said, ""Our military is at a state of full readiness, and if North Korea wages provocation, there will be firm punishment.""  As one of South Korea's closest allies, the United States deployed a  B-52 bomber to be flown over South Korea as  a show of force.   There was also some speculation about the deployment of an aircraft carrier to the Korean peninsula, according to South Korea's Yonhap News Agency; however, no further details were available at the time of writing...  For its part,  North Korea increased its troop deployments in front-line units along the border with South Korea.   Moreover, North Korea appeared undeterred by international condemnation.  Indeed, North Korean leader, King Jong-un,  called for his country to expand its  nuclear arsenal.  As reported in the state-controlled media, ""(Kim) called for bolstering up both in quality and quantity the nuclear force capable of making nuclear strikes at the U.S.-led imperialists any time and in any space ... if they encroach upon the sovereignty of the DPRK and make threatening provocations.""  State media in North Korea noted that Kin Jong-un had called   the ""detonation of more powerful H-bomb in the future.""  This alarming statement from North Korea  motivated  South Korean President Park Geun-hye to state that ""provocations"" by the North should result not simply in new sanctions, but in fact  tougher measures than before.  She said,  ""We are cooperating closely with the United States and allies to come up with effective sanctions that will make North Korea feel bone-numbing pain, not only at the Security Council but also bilaterally and multilaterally.""  The South Korean president also urged China to use its influence with North Korea productively as she said, ""I am certain that China is very well aware if such a strong will isn't followed by necessary steps, we will not be able to stop the North's fifth and sixth nuclear tests and we cannot guarantee true peace and stability.""  In the United States, there was no patience to wait for coordinated multilateral action.  In a rare moment of bipartisanship, the   House of Representatives voted decisively to pass legislation intended to expand punitive sanctions against North Korea.  It should be noted that even as the nuclear experts and global powers dismissed North Korea's claims of carrying out a hydrogen test,  the United States was also dismissing an earlier claim by North Korea that he had fired a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM).   At issue was videotaped footage released by North Korea presumably intended to support its claim that its ballistic missile technology was sufficiently developed so as to launch a nuclear warhead from a submarine.  According to North Korea, the submarine test took place in December 2015; however, analysis from experts indicated that the videotaped footage may have been  doctored.  According to the South Korea's military, the video  was very likely edited with Scud missile footage from 2014.  Likewise, experts at the  James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS) in California in the United States concluded that the footage was heavily modified.   John Schilling from the 38 North Korea monitoring website at John Hopkins University went further in noting that the footage actually indicated a failed launch and thus suggested that North Korea was not making as much technological progress in this realm as claimed.  He said, ""The failed launch, combined with testing from a barge shows that North Korea still has a long way to go to develop this system.""  He added, ""An initial operational capability of a North Korean ballistic-missile submarine is not expected before 2020.""  On Feb. 7, 2016, only weeks after its alleged hydrogen bomb test, North Korea again violated prevailing United Nations Security Resolutions and carried out a long range rocket test.   North Korea  issued a statement in which it claimed that a new Earth observation satellite, the Kwangmyongsong-4, was sent using an Unha launch vehicle from the Sohae space center in North Phyongan province and placed into orbit.  According to Pyongyang, the rocket launch was for the peaceful purpose of placing a satellite into orbit; however, typically, Pyongyang makes this type of claim in order to mask the fact that it was actually testing ballistic missile technology.  Such long range missile tests are typically understood as ways of trying to refine its ability to target an enemy nation with a nuclear bomb using ballistic missile delivery systems.   Of significance was the fact that the first stage of the rocket was prepared in such as way as to self-destruct after separation, and thus limit the ability of foreign powers to analyze the rocket debris.  That being said, the rocket's second stage was thought to have landed in the marine waters close to Luzon Island in  the Philippines -- more than 2,00  kilometers away from  its North Korean launch pad.  That distance would undoubtedly worry foreign powers, which would use their capabilities to try to locate the second stage rocket debris.   At the same time,  defense officials in the United States have disputed North Korea's claim of a successful satellite launch,  noting that in fact the device was actually  ""tumbling in orbit"" and  not capable of meaningful function.  Nevertheless,  even an unsuccessful launch of a rocket into space would provide North Korea with the opportunity to test the reliability of its rocket systems.  That alone would grant North Korea technological insight.  Moreover, the fact that North Korea had carried out the test in defiance of international law set off alarm bells across the globe.   Given the threat posed by North Korea in the aftermath of such provocative activity in 2016, United States officials made clear that they would accelerate plans to  implement a missile defense system.  Meanwhile, as was the case following the alleged hydrogen test, the United Nations Security Council reacted with a vociferous condemnation and again threatened to move forward with new punitive sanctions. But a tone of frustration appeared to come from Japan, whose envoy to the United Nations, Motohide Yoshikawa, complained that the Security Council's existing sanctions had  ""not stopped North Korea from developing nuclear weapons.""  As such,  the Japanese envoy demanded tougher measures against North Korea.  United States Ambassador Samantha Power appeared to concur, as she declared,  ""There can be no business as usual.""  The truth of the matter was that , as before, China appeared to have little appetite to move in that direction.  ***  Editor's Note on North Korea's Nuclear Test History:  In October 2006, North Korea said it intended to test a nuclear weapon.  Despite strenuous urging by the international community, including China, that North Korea not follow this course, North Korea carried out a test of a nuclear weapon. The international community responded to North Korea's announcement with widespread condemnation and a punitive United Nations Security Council resolution endorsing financial and security sanctions.  Resolution  1718 called for  the inspections on cargo going to and from North Korea to search for weapons, a ban on the sale or transfer of materials related to North Korea's unconventional weapons program, and a freeze on the transfer of funds connected with North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs. The resolution was passed under Chapter Seven, Article 41, of the United Nations Charter; however, absent from Resolution 1718 was the Chapter Seven provision that would enforce the sanctions via military force. For its part,  the North Korean government in Pyongyang decried Resolution 1718,  and warned that subsequent pressure by the United States would be regarded as  ""a declaration of war.""  April 2009 saw North Korea take provocative action by launching a communications satellite into space via rocket.  That claim was widely viewed as obfuscation of a missile test.  Then a month later in May 2009, less than three years after the earlier underground nuclear test, North Korea conducted a second such test, arguing the merits of its right to a military deterrent. Days later, North Korea announced its withdrawal from the armistice that ended the Korean War.  At the international level, the United Nations Security Council noted that the 2009 nuclear test by North Korea was a violation of Security Council Resolution 1718, which prohibits Pyongyang from carrying out nuclear tests.  In response, the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1874 in June 2009 -- a month after the underground nuclear test.  The resolution was passed under Chapter Seven, Article 41, of the United Nations Charter, and imposed further economic and commercial sanctions on North Korea.  Additionally,  it encouraged United Nations member states to search North Korean cargo in the effort to enforce those sanctions.  It should be noted that the nuclear tests in 2006 and 2009 constituted unassailable violations of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1718  and  1874, which exist in tandem with Article 41 of Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter and compel compliance by all member states. They are binding under international law.   The 2006 and 2009 nuclear tests were also breaches of  the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.  The apparent nuclear test on Feb. 12, 2013 would also stand as a flagrant violation of that treaty.  In March 2013, the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 2094 censuring North Korea for its February  nuclear test and imposing an even stricter sanctions regime on that country.  The United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the unanimous adoption of the resolution delivered a strong message to North Korea that its pursuit of nuclear weapons would not be tolerated by the international community.  Still, North Korea responded in April 2013 by cutting off its connections with South Korea, ending its armistice, threatening to re-open its Yongbyon nuclear reactor, and issuing brazen threats against South Korea and the United States.  By May 2013, the political climate appeared to have cooled.  In June 2013, there was a bizarre mix of progress and retreat on the diplomatic front as the two Koreas  planned and then cancelled bilateral negotiations; however, North Korea then proposed direct talks with the United States.  In August  2013 through September 2013, the two Koreas finally agreed to re-open operations at the jointly administered Kaesong industrial zone. But once again, there was a mix of progress and retreat as by September 2013, signs pointed to the fact that operations were being restarted at North Korea's Yongbyon reactor.  The first part of 2014 was marked by a flurry of brazen activity by North Korea in the form of ballistic missile tests, threats of a ""new form"" nuclear test, and the exchange of fire with South Korean forces in the flashpoint disputed maritime region. Later in 2014, North Korea fired short range missiles on various occasions coinciding with visits to South Korea by world leaders, such as Chinese President Xi Jinping and Pope Francis.  In early 2015, with joint military exercises looming between the United States and South Korea, North Korea launched anti-ship missiles from hover ships. North Korea's news agency  published images showing  the hover ships launching a so-called ""cutting-edge anti-ship rocket"" that would be used to secure the contested marine border with South Korea.  At the time, there was speculation as to whether Pyongyang's moves were  acts  of belligerence aimed at improving North Korea's negotiating position for the future, or, if they were intended to be blatant and irrational acts of provocation.  On Jan. 6,  2016, North Korea carried out its fourth nuclear tests in flagrant violation of prevailing United Nations resolutions.  With Pyongyang claiming to  have successfully  carried out  its first underground test of a miniaturized hydrogen bomb, the focus was not so much on Pyongyang's intent as it was on the international community's response.  Could the United Nations Security Council members close ranks and produce a new resolution?  And even if it was able to do so, would that document be any more capable of preventing North Korea from continued violations of international law?   The answers to those questions remained elusive at the time of writing.  ***  Editor's Note on North Korea's Nuclear Capability:  The main question is whether or not North Korea can make good on its threats against the United States are its allies.  It was clear that both South Korea and Japan were within range of potential North Korean missile attacks.   North Korea's medium-range Nodong 1, a single-stage liquid-propelled weapon based on Soviet ""Scud"" technology, could reach Japanese and South Korean targets, according to an International Institute for Strategic Studies overview of North Korea's missile program.  However, that technology was not known for its targeting prowess and was thus not to be regarded as a ""precision strike"" mechanism.  Obviously, at an even further distance, the Nodong 1 could not really be regarded as a serious threat against Guam. It was possible that North Korea could  deploy its multi-stage intermediate range ballistic missile, the Taepodong, against the United States base on Guam, but the record for the Taepodong was not stellar, even failing during flight testing.  In April 2013, North Korea moved a medium-range missile, known as a Musudan or Nodong B, to its east coast. It was  not known if there was a warhead mounted on the missile, or, if the movement of the missile was part of the preparations for yet another missile test. While this Musudan/Nodong B missile has a range of 3,000 kilometers (1,875 miles), which would put all of South Korea, Japan and possibly Guam in its range, there was no reliable test history to ensure precision.  A missile launch would ostensibly be aimed at acquiring that flight test history, thus driving South Korea to deploy warships with missile defense systems to the coasts.  It should be noted that the Kn-o8 missile was believed to have enough range to hit United States terrain such as Alaska, Hawaii, and Guam.  This missile was actually displayed at a recent North Korean military parade.  However, there were some suggestions that the missile was not yet viable, with some experts even suggesting it was only a ""mock-up"" missile.  The longer range option for North Korea would likely be the multi-stage rocket, the Unha-3, which was used to launch a satellite into space  in late 2012. Theoretically,  the Unha  -- with its range of 10,000 kilometers -- could deliver a nuclear warhead-sized payload as far as Alaska or Hawaii or even California.  However,  as noted by the Center for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS), previous launches of Unha-based rockets have not been terribly successful, raising questions about the technology's reliability.  Moreover,  unlike most intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICMBs) which use  solid fuel, the Unha-3 is powered by liquid fuel, which cannot  be stored for long periods inside the rocket.  Accordingly, the Unha-3 was a liquid-fueled rocket, it would have to sit on a launch pad for lengthy periods of time for fueling, leaving it essentially vulnerable to a strike. For all these reasons, the CNS has concluded that while the Unha was evidence of North Korea's missile capability, it was  not deemed to be ""a reliable system capable of delivering a nuclear weapon to the continental United States.""  Still,  the navy of South Korea obtained first stage debris from the 2012 Unha launch and concluded that North Korea had made some technological strides.  Notably, the missile showed a capacity for steering thanks to the use of small auxiliary engines instead of jet vanes.  Another consideration as regards North Korea's progress on nuclear development was the use of uranium versus plutonium in nuclear testing.  It is widely believed that North Korea  used plutonium as fissile material for nuclear tests undertaken in 2006 and 2009.  But there were suspicions by experts that  North Korea might have used uranium in its recent (February 2013) nuclear test. The use of uranium  could indicate North Korea's intent to expand its nuclear arsenal through uranium enrichment.  In 2013, the general consensus  was that North Korea had not  (yet) developed the technology to manufacture a  miniaturized nuclear device small enough to fit on a ballistic missile, which would be needed to carry out a nuclear attack on the United States.  North Korea has carried out nuclear weapons tests and has made it clear that future tests were in the offing. But producing a nuclear explosion was not the same as producing a nuclear device small enough to fit on the top of a missile that could be delivered across an extensive range of territory.  Indeed, not only do nuclear warheads have to be small enough to fit on a missile, they also have to be able to durable enough to withstand intense heat, as well as the vibration of re-entry, and they need to possess the precision to arrive at their intended targets.  As noted by  Greg Thielmann, a senior fellow at the Arms Control Association, ""Based on the testing we've seen and some other assumptions about North Korean abilities, we don't think they're ready to arm an ICBM with a nuclear warhead yet even if they had an ICBM, which they don't yet.""  That being said, a new assessment of North Korea's nuclear capability conducted by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA)  of the Pentagon  concluded with ""moderate confidence"" that North Korea had, for the first time, learned how to manufacture a nuclear weapon small enough to be delivered via a ballistic missile.  The precise language used by the Defense Intelligence Agency was as follows: ""North currently has nuclear weapons capable of delivery by ballistic missiles however the reliability will be low.""  The assessment,  portions of which were publicized in a report by the New York Times on April 11, 2013, was a sobering and disturbing revelation at a time of heightened tensions on the Korean peninsular.  Related to this report was emerging insight derived from debris from the rocket used by the North Koreans to launch a satellite into space in December 2012.  The United States Navy was able to retrieve the front section of the rocket for study by experts, thus contributing to assessments about possible warhead designs by the North Koreans. According to media reports, that front section of the satellite rocket offered scientists evidence that North Korea was manufacturing the missile's cone at dimensions suitable for a nuclear warhead, and intended to function on a long-range missile capable of re-entry to the earth's atmosphere from space.  Anxieties over this possible benchmark by the North Koreans were likely to be assuaged by the general view that such a nuclear weapon would likely be hampered by low reliability -- a plausible deduction given North Korea's poor record of developing accurate weapons and its limited test history of missiles in its possession. As well, even if North Korea did make technological strides and was now able to make a deliverable warhead, it would still have to be able to withstand intense heat and the vibration of re-entry, and would to be sufficiently tested for target precision, as noted above.  To that end, North Korea has no test history of a re-entry vehicle and without that functional technology, it cannot deliver a warhead.  In  recent years, North Korea has made claims of miniaturization.  Indeed, in January 2016, North Korea claimed that  successfully carried out its first underground test of a miniaturized hydrogen bomb.  While experts have discounted North Korea's claim of thermonuclear strides, and concluded that North Korea more likely tested a boosted fission device rather than a hydrogen bomb, there was  not enough verifiable data available to prove of disprove the miniaturization assertion by North Korea.  It should be noted that in a report to the United States Congress at the start of May 2013,  the United States Department of Defense made clear that North Korea was aiming to move closer to its goal of striking the United States  with a nuclear-armed missile.  There was no estimate as to when North Korea might achieve that capability; however, the report surmised that progress on this front would be dependent on North Korea's degree of investment in its military program.  And to that end, North Korea was believed to be committed to becoming a nuclear powerhouse, irrespective of its domestic challenges of famine, starvation, and economic strife. The report emphasized the view that North Korea's key strategic aim was to deploy  ""coercive diplomacy"" to force the international community to accept its nuclear ambitions.  No reference in this report was made of the aforementioned conclusions of the DIA.  For its part, the United States government has long maintained the position that it has the ability to protect the homeland. To that end, in mid-March 2013, the Obama administration in the United States said it would deploy additional ballistic-missile interceptors along the country's Pacific Coast, with an eye on protecting the United States from a potential attack from North Korea. The deployment of  additional ballistic-missile interceptors  would increase the number (currently based in California and Alaska) from 30 to 44. As well, the United States  moved its  sea-based  X-Band radar platform, normally based in Hawaii, closer to the North Korean coast, with the intent of monitoring  potential attempts from North Korea to launch a long-range missile.  The radar system also possesses the capability to search and track targets, as well as communicate with interceptor missiles at overseas bases that can shoot down  missiles.  By April 2013, the United States  decided to deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense system to Guam.  The anti-ballistic missile interceptor system and the X-Band radar platform  do not  guarantee protection against a possible North Korean attack; however, they are intended to deter Pyongyang, which has been known to have only a limited intercontinental ballistic missile arsenal.  Experts have concluded that  North Korea simply does not have the military capability to carry out a nuclear strike on United States territory.  In May 2013, in an effort to show that the United States was fully prepared to defend itself from the potential nuclear missile threat posed by North Korea or any other belligerent nation state, the Missile Defense Agency along with the United States Navy  completed a successful test of a missile defense system as it destroyed a target launched in the Pacific Ocean.  According to  the  Department of Defense, a short-range ballistic missile target was launched  from the Pacific Missile Range Facility on the Hawaiian island of Kauai;  the USS Lake Erie was able to  detect and track the missile, then launch a blocking missile with a kinetic warhead, which successfully destroyed the target.  United States officials said the test operation in Hawaii demonstrated that the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense system was fully functional.  Should a confrontation actually emerge, North Korea would be helped by the fact that its  army is the fifth largest in the world; however,  it is also inexperienced having not seen combat since 1953, and having been deprived of the superior and sophisticated training available to the smaller South Korean military, or the extensive United States military industrial complex.  As well, a great deal of North Korea's military equipment is outdated in comparison to Western powers.  That being said, even outdated military equipment can still (presumably) function and thus North Korea poses  a real and serious threat to global security.  Retired United States Admiral Dennis Blair, a former head of the United States Pacific Command and  director of national intelligence in the Obama administration, cautioned against taking a sanguine stance in response to the North Korean threat posed in 2013.  He said in an interview with Bloomberg News, ""I'm not relaxed about this one...I think this one's more dangerous.""  Most experts on North Korea posit the view that Pyongyang is not really prepared to ignite a conflict that would ensure its own destruction; however, they note that Kim Jong-un's inexperience could lead to misunderstanding and miscalculations with potentially catastrophic consequences.  For example, regardless of its intended target, a missile launched by the North that appears to be headed towards South Korea or Japan -- accidentally or otherwise -- would clearly yield a response from those countries or the United States.  That response could itself be a catalyst for a deadly confrontation among players armed with no shortage of conventional weapons,  not to mention nuclear bombs.  Indeed, Admiral Samuel J. Locklear, the top United States commander in the Pacific, said during testimony before the Senate Armed Services committee on April 9, 2013, that while the United States would not opt to shoot down a North Korean missile aimed for open waters, interceptors would be used to defend against a North Korean missile perceived as threatening the interests of the United States or its allies.  It was an unknown matter as to how a paranoid regime like North Korea would itself respond to such defensive action.  Meanwhile, as noted by then-United States Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel of his country's ability to respond to threats posed by North Korea: ""We have every capacity to deal with any action that North Korea would take, to protect this country and the interests of this country and our allies."" At the same news conference with Hagel,  General Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the United States military Joint Chiefs of Staff,  would not say if he believe North Korea had been able to make a nuclear warhead small enough to fit onto a ballistic missile; however, he warned that the United States need to be prepared for the worst possible scenarios.  Dempsey said: ""They [the North Koreans] have conducted two nuclear tests. They have conducted several successful ballistic missile launches. And in the absence of concrete evidence to the contrary, we have to assume the worst case, and that's why we're postured as we are today.""  In 2014, North Korea was showing little restraint on the matter of ballistic missile tests and was now threatening to carry out another  nuclear test -- this one of a ""new form"" variety.  Once again, in keeping with Martin Dempsey's prudent warning mentioned just above -- in the absence of clear data regarding North Korea's nuclear capabilities and recent technological strides, the global community interested in security and stability would do well not to dismiss North Korea as simply indulging in saber rattling.   The 2016 nuclear test carried out by North Korea would underline this warning in stark terms.  In 2016, following North Korea's claim of having produced a hydrogen bomb, along with its launch of the  Kwangmyongsong-4  satellite  into space, questions about North Korea's intercontinental ballistic missile technology, capable of delivering a nuclear bomb, again surfaced.  Of note was the question of whether or not North Korea could dispatch a nuclear-armed missile to a target in another country, such as Japan or the United States.  As before this question focused on the matter of whether or not  North Korea's  intercontinental ballistic missile technology was capable of transporting a nuclear payload accurately over  a long distances.   In truth, only intense testing for reliability could guarantee such an end and North Korea's test history remained limited.  But even satellite launch -- even failed ones -- provide data for missile technology experts and that fact cannot be ignored.  Still, North Korea would have to be able to successfully develop a  miniaturized nuclear weapons that could fit on the top of a rocket, and it would also have to be stable enough to withstand intense heat and  re-entry into the atmosphere.   There were some fears being expressed by United States experts that North Korea had made strides in the miniaturization process; however, the government of the United States has insisted this was not the case.   The ""re-entry"" aspect was also unsettled as some experts have suggested that North Korea  may well have developed a ""re-entry vehicle.""  Of course the remaining problem for North Korea was that there was little guarantee that its missiles could be delivered with reliability and accuracy.  Given these considerations, back in 2015, the United States National Security Council spokesperson, Patrick Ventrell, issued the following statement:  ""Our assessment of North Korea's nuclear capabilities has not changed. We do not think that they have that capacity.""  He added, ""However, they are working on developing a number of long-range missiles, including intercontinental ballistic missiles, that could eventually threaten our allies and the homeland.""  That warning could only be understood as even more pertinent in 2016.   ***  Special Entry:  Events pertaining to North Korea's 2016 nuclear activities  Deteriorating relations on Korean Peninsula

Relations on the Korean peninsula deteriorated in the period in early 2016 when North Korea carried out a hydrogen bomb test and launched a satellite into space, the latter of which was generally regarded as a ruse for a ballistic missile test.   The two actions were regarded as virulent acts of provocation, committed in flagrant contravention of international law,  and thus constituted a threat to regional -- if not global -- security, .    Tensions on the Korean peninsula deteriorated further in February 2016 when South Korea decided to suspend operations at the  Kaesong industrial zone, which has been jointly administered by the two Koreas and viewed as a venue for cooperation.  South Korea made the move in response to North Korea's provocative and belligerent actions, as noted just above.  But North Korea itself reacted by evicting all South Koreans from the   Kaesong industrial zone  and accusing South Korea of effectively ""declaring war.""   The Democratic People's Republic of Korea's (DPRK)   Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea released a statement that read as follows: ""Unpardonable is the puppet group's act of totally suspending the operation in (Kaesong), finding fault with the DPRK's H-bomb test and launch of a satellite."" United States says it rejected peace treaty proposal by North Korea because it did not include denuclearization provisions In February 2016, the United States Department of State said that it had recently  rejected a peace treaty proposal by North Korea because it did not include provisions for  denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula.  in response to a question posed during a Wall Street Journal interview, John Kirby, the spokesperson for the United States Department of State,  acknowledged that the White House agreed to go forward with  peace talks with North Korea, which would broadly encompass many issues including North Korea's nuclear program.  However,  North Korea was not interested in peace talks that included a discussion of its nuclear arsenal, and then on Jan. 6, 2016, went forward with its claimed hydrogen bomb test.  That move effectively ended the diplomatic track.  Of significance, according to  Kirby, was the fact that North Korea initiated the contact over a proposed  peace treaty.  As noted by Kirby,  ""To be clear, it was the North Koreans who proposed discussing a peace treaty."" United States and China reach agreement on draft resolution expanding sanctions against North Korea over nuclear activities In late February 2016,  in response to North Korea's provocative nuclear activities in contravention of international law, the United States and China arrived at an agreement  intended to expand United Nations Security Council sanctions against that country.  In the aftermath of North Korea's hydrogen bomb test in January 2016,  Washington D. C. and  Beijing have been ensconced in  rigorous negotiations aimed at drafting a  draft resolution. The two sides were not in complete agreement about what types of initiatives should be undertaken,  with Beijing favoring dialogue and advocating non-proliferation, and with Washington D.C. pushing for more stringent punitive  measures, including curbs on Pyongyang's ability to access the global financial system.  Other provisions being explored included mandatory inspections on cargo passing from or to North Korea, a  ban on all supplies of aviation and rocket fuel to North Korea,  and a ban on the transfer to North Korea of any item that could be used for military purposes. Despite the distance on some of these items, Washington D. C. and  Beijing were finally able to find concurrence and craft the draft resolution, which they hoped would be introduced and  voted on in the full 15-member United Nations Security Council at the start of March 2016.  Of significance was the fact that the resolution was passed into international law. Significantly, North Korea reacted to  the Security Council resolution by casting it as a ""criminal act"" orchestrated  by the United States and vowed to continue its nuclear proliferation activities. A government spokesperson said in an interview with the state-controlled KCNA media said, ""Our response will involve the full use of various means and tools including a strong and ruthless physical response."" North Korean leader instructs military to be ready to use nuclear weapons and makes miniaturization claims; U.S. discusses missile defense shield  protection with South Korea In the first week of March 2016, North Korea's leader,  Kim Jong-un, declared that his country's nuclear weapons should be made  ready for use ""at any time"" and  in a ""pre-emptive attack"" mode.   According to state media in North Korea, King Jong-un called on the military to adjust its posture so that it could launch pre-emptive strikes upon demand.   As stated by Kim Jong-un, North Korea  ""Now is the time for us to convert our mode of military counteraction toward the enemies into a pre-emptive attack one in every aspect.""  He added that North Korea ""must always be ready to fire our nuclear warheads at any time"" due to the threat posed by the country's enemies. Kim Jong-un identified those enemies, as follows: ""At an extreme time when the Americans... are urging war and disaster on other countries and people, the only way to defend our sovereignty and right to live is to bolster our nuclear capability.""   There were some suggestions that this move by North Korea, which was accompanied by a volley of short-range missile launched into the sea, constituted a belligerent response to the tough sanctions imposed by the United Nations on North Korea for its recent provocative nuclear activities.   As is usually the case with North Korea,  the move could only mean an escalation of tensions on the Korean peninsula. The United States Pentagon reacted with the spokesperson issuing the following statement: ""We urge North Korea to refrain from provocative actions that aggravate tensions and instead focus on fulfilling its international obligations and commitments.""  As well, the United States convened talks with South Korea aimed at possibly deploying an American missile defense shield to the South Korea.  To that end, the discussion would focus on the feasibility financially and environmentally of installing the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system in South Korea, along with its effectiveness in potentially shooting down short and medium-range ballistic missiles, thus destroying incoming warheads.  Of note was the fact that the THAAD was already installed in Hawaii and Guam to protect the United States from potential attacks from North Korea. Those defense systems would be of paramount importance given North Korea's claims on March 9, 2016, that its scientists had made technological strides and developed miniaturized nuclear warheads that could be fitted on ballistic missiles.   Of significance was the fact that North Korea state media has  published photographs of Kim Jong-un  at the testing event of a multiple launch rocket system, and also posing with what was claimed to be miniaturized weapon.  It should be noted that there was no verification of North Korea's claims in these regards although the release of the images was clearly geared to proving its claims.

North Korea is one of the most isolated communist countries in the world. For several decades, it carried out a policy of self-reliance and self-sufficiency and refused to establish relations with countries it identified as capitalist or imperialist Western countries. Its relationship with South Korea also formed much of its post-World War II history and still drives much of its foreign policy. Recent developments in the country have shown dramatic changes in its foreign policy. In the past few years, North Korea has established diplomatic relations with many Western countries, and its relations with South Korea have had a tremendous breakthrough since the North-South summit in 2000. Since 2001, however, the chill in relations with the United States (U.S.) has had negative repercussions on North Korea's relations with several other countries. It was yet to be seen if the new Obama administration (as of 2009)would augur a shift in the diplomatic climate.

Regional RelationsIntroduction

North Korea is situated at the northern part of the Korean peninsula between the Sea of Japan and the Yellow Sea. Japan lies east of the peninsula across the Sea of Japan. North Korea shares borders with the People's Republic of China along the Yalu River and with China and Russia along the Tumen River.

Relations with South Korea

The military demarcation line (MDL) between North and South Korea has formed the boundary between the two since the close of the Korean War in the early 1950s. A demilitarized zone (DMZ) extends for 2,000 meters on either side of the MDL. However, both the North and South Korean governments hold that the MDL is only a temporary administrative line, not a permanent border.

For decades after the Korean War, both Korean governments had repeatedly reiterated their desire to reunify the Korean peninsula. Until 1971, however, the two governments had no direct contacts or communications. In 1972, a series of secret meetings resulted in the announcement of an agreement by South and North Korea aimed at working toward peaceful reunification and an end to the hostile atmosphere prevailing on the peninsula. In 1994, after former U.S. President Carter's visit to North Korea in June, North and South Korea agreed to hold a summit in July. The two sides went ahead with plans for the summit, but it was cancelled because of Kim Il Sung's sudden death on July 8, 1994.

In April 2000, the governments of the two Koreas reached an agreement to hold the first-ever summit in Pyongyang. From June 13-15, 2000, North Korean leader Kim Jong il and South Korean President Kim Dae-jung held the summit in Pyongyang. The two leaders reached a historic agreement during the summit to reduce tensions between the two sides of the peninsula and work towards the reunification. The two leaders also agreed that North Korean leader Kim Jong il would pay a return visit to SouthKorea in the near future.

Since the June 2000 summit, considerable achievements have been made in improving relationship between North and South Korea. In August and November 2000, two rounds of family reunion events took place in the Korean Peninsula. The two Koreas have also started working on the transport re-link between the two sides by reconnecting the railway between the capital cities of the two.

Government officials from North and South Korea have been keeping in contact since the summit, holding meetings regularly to discuss matters of reunification and cooperation.

As noted above, however, since 2001, North Korea's relations with its neighbors have become strained. The declaration by the United States that North Korea is part of an ""axis of evil"" in 2002 is believed (by some, not all) to have spurred the restarting of a nuclear program in the country. The prospect of a nuclear North Korea caused panic and anxiety in the region and across the wider world. North Korea's announcements -- as recent as 2006 -- that it has successfully developed nuclear weaponry, has not helped the situation. The test-firing of missiles and the unprecedented test of a nuclear weapon in 2006 served only to worsen relations across the border, and also within the region. However, progress on nuclear disarmament, which began to move progressively forward at the start of 2007, may contribute to a significant shift. (See below for further details.)

In mid-July 2007, North Korea said that it shut down its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon. A team of inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was monitoring the situation at Yongbyon in order to verify Pyongyang's claim. Nevertheless, the announcement was welcomed by the countries of the West, the wider world, and particularly by the countries participating in multilateral talks with North Korea aimed at disarmament.

In October 2007, South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun and the North Korea's leader Kim Jong-il signed a joint declaration calling for a permanent peace agreement on the Korean Peninsula. The eight-point declaration set forth an agenda for international dialogue aimed at crafting a treaty, which would replace the existing armistice that brought an end to the Korean War that took place from 1950 to 1953. The declaration also came on the heels of a significant announcement by North Korea that it  would end its nuclear ambitions.

In July 2008, a South Korean woman was shot to death by a North Korean soldier. North Korean authorities said that the 53-year old woman strayed from the special tourism zone in the mountains into a restricted area of the Mount Kumgang resort. More than one million South Korean visitors have traveled to the resort, which is located in a strategic nazal area, in the last decade without any such incident occurring. South Korean authorities responded by suspending cross-border trips, pending an investigation. Because cross-border tourism trips have been the fulcrum of economic and cultural cooperation in the last decade, the incident had the potential to adversely affect cross-border relations. It was viewed as a setback at the time when fresh dialogue with North Korea was being considered.

In 2009, peninsula relations became increasingly complex due to provocative actions taken by North Korea, including an underground nuclear test and a series of missile tests. See below in the section called ""Recent Developments"" for more details.

That said, South Korea and North Korea agreed to the arrange reunions for separated families from either side of the Korean peninsula. The reunions were scheduled to be held from September 26, 2009 to October 1, 2009 in the Mount Gumgang area. The agreement was forged following talks between delegates from the respective Red Cross societies in North Korea and South Korea. A joint statement read as follows: ""The South and the North will continue to cooperate on the issue of separated families and other humanitarian issues involving the Red Cross."" The program of reuniting Korean families commenced in 2000 following a landmark inter-Korean summit. Since that time, the two sides have held several reunions and orchestrated a number of video exchanges although the last such meetings took place in October 2007. Soon thereafter, South Korea's hard line government of President LeeMyung-bak came to power, bilateral relations devolved, and the program was suspended. This 2009 agreement could be illustrative of a possible breakthrough between the two sides.

****See below for further coverage of relations between the two Koreas.****Relations with Japan

Relations between North Korea and Japan have saw significant developments in the past decade. As early as 1990, North Korea and Japan began negotiations in Pyongyang on the establishment of diplomatic ties. Taking it as a prerequisite for normalizing relations with Japan, North Korea has been demanding an apology and compensation from Japan for its colonial occupation of Korea in the first half of the 20th century. For their part, Japan has been asking for information of the alleged abduction by North Korean agents of Japanese citizens in the 1960s and 1970s, which has been denied by North Korea. After eight rounds of talks, these issues still remained unresolved and finally brought the rapprochement talks to a rapture in late 1992.

Relations deteriorated in September 1998 when Japan imposed sanctions on North Korea following the country performed a test launch of missiles over Japan. In December 1999, the two countries agreed to resume talks when a Japanese delegation visited Pyongyang. Later, Japan lifted sanctions on North Korea. All these paved the way for the negotiations on the normalization of relations between North Korea and Japan held in Pyongyang on April 5-7, 2000, after seven years of interruption. In August and October 2000, North Korea and Japan held another two rounds of talks, one in Tokyo, the other in Beijing. Although the negotiations did not make tangible progress, they have served as a good start toward the normalization of bilateral relations.

In September 2002, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi of Japan held a summit meeting with Kim Jong il. The focus of the meeting was to foster improved relationships between Japan and North Korea. The meeting signaled an interesting drift in Japanese foreign policy towards a view independent of the United States on policy in North Korea. At that time in 2002, North Korea forged a concord with Japan by which both parties agreed to a moratorium on missile tests. It was an agreement that was reaffirmedin 2004.

Nuclear development (discussed throughout this ""Country Review"") have served to severely strain relations between North Korea and Japan once again. The test firing of missiles and the enactment of a nuclear weapons test in 2006 effectively abrogated the existing concord between the two countries. The state of the diplomatic discussions on nuclear disarmament from 2007 through 2009, along with new leadership in the United States, may well contribute to a shift in bilateral relations.

Relations with China

North Korea and China have generally had good ties due to the fact that both countries are communist states. China has, however, worked with the West to resolve issues related to North Korea's controversial nuclear program. Indeed, it has encouraged North Korea to participate in multilateral talks on the matter. In 2005, the Chinese government assured United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice that it would push multi-party talks with North Korea, which would be aimed at ending the nuclear crisis on the Korean peninsula. A year later, there as no progress on this front. For its part, however, North Korea said it had no interest in re-entering such talks, which stalled in recent years. Nevertheless, multilateral talks resumed again in December 2006 and January 2007; see below for more recent details related to North Korea's nuclear program and the multilateral negotiations on the matter.Other Important RelationsGeneral Overview

In recent years, two major developments of events in North Korea have brought about changes in the country's international relations. In 1995 and 1996, massive flooding resulted in an agricultural disaster in North Korea, which forced the North Korean government to give up its self-sufficiency policy in order to request food aid from foreign countries. China, the United States, Japan and other nations have responded to donate food supply to North Korea.

In contrast to its severe food shortage as well as numerous deaths caused by the famine, North Korea's development of nuclear technology and missile delivery systems has led to tensions and negotiations with Japan, China, South Korea and the United States in the past few years. In the mid 1990s, a series of agreements between the North Korean and other governments led to foreign assistance in developing North Korea's nuclear energy capabilities in exchange for regular international inspections of North Korea's nuclear facilities. Since 2002, however, North Korea has moved away from those agreement and advanced a strong nuclear program, including the development of nuclear weapons, to the grave dismay of the global community. Progress on nuclear disarmament, however, was noted in late 2006 and early 2007. The effects on the climate of foreign relations was yet to be determined.

Notable Ties

North Korea has made other diplomatic initiatives to break its decades-long isolation. In January 2000, North Korea and Italy established diplomatic relations, and in May, North Korea established diplomatic ties with Australia. In July 2000, North Korea joined the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) forum, with its foreign minister holding talks with his counterparts from ASEAN nations for the first time.

North Korea established diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom in December 2000, and with the Netherlands and Canada in January 2001. Other Western nations including Germany, France, Spain and Belgium have also expressed their willingness to normalize relations with North Korea.

Relations with the United States

The Perry Report, prepared by the United States (U.S.) special advisor on North Korea, was released in September 1999 and outlined a new approach to foreign policy regarding North Korea. The report called for the normalization of ties with North Korea and a cessation of attempts to depose the government. Perry recommended a reduction of sanctions in order to prevent North Korea from developing a nuclear weapons program. Moreover, the United States sought to disarm North Korea's nuclear program by helping to provide fuel aid to North Korea to help prevent the processing of nuclear fuel that can be turned into atomic weapons. For several years following the end of the Cold War, North Korea had focused its diplomatic activities on relations with the United States in its belief that improved relations with Washington, D.C. was crucial for the survival of the regime. The United States has been the largest grain donor to North Korea. But North Korea had complained that the United States had often ignored its desire to improve relations, believing that it paid attention to North Korea only when it launched provocative steps by resorting to nuclear weapons or missile development programs.

For years, North Korea tried to reach around South Korean leaders to strike a deal with the United States (U.S.), and the U.S. government insisted that direct dialogue between North and South Korea must come first. The U.S. goal had been to induce impoverished North Korea to drop its weapons of mass destruction program and fully turn from supporting terrorism. Then in June 2000, only a few days after the historic summit between the leaders of both Koreas, the United States made a decision to ease wide-ranging sanctions imposed on North Korea. This move has cleared the way for financial transactions and trade in all but the most sensitive goods between the two countries. In addition, it was intended to permit new air and shipping service between North Korea and the United States.

In October 2000, former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright paid a two-day visit to North Korea, being the most senior American official ever to go to the country. Albright's visit was seen as groundbreaking as well as opening a new chapter in U.S.-North Korea relations. During the visit, Albright and the North Korean leader Kim Jong il held several talks covering a full range of issuesincluding terrorism, human rights and concrete steps for tension reduction on the Korean Peninsula. One week after Albright's visit, North Korea and the United States held discussions in Malaysia on the development of ballistic missiles by North Korea, but it was ended without reaching an agreement.

The missile talks between the two countries focused on two key issues: North Korea's domestic long range missile program and its export of missile technology to countries such as Pakistan and Iran. The United States claimed that North Korea was the world's top exporter of missile equipment and technology to those countries. As for the missile program, the United States was exploring the idea of exchanging launches of North Korea's satellites for serious missile restraint by North Korea.

The momentum towards normalization of relations between North Korea and the outside world was slowed with the election of President George Bush in the United States (U.S.). Early in his administration President Bush ordered a review of U.S. policy towards North Korea and the Bush Administration has made it clear that improved relations with the US depended on progress across a broad range of security issues including force deployments, nuclear weapons and missiles.

The U.S.-North Korea relationship was dealt a blow with the terrorist attack against the United States on Sept. 11, 2001. The backlash by the United States against the terrorists responsible for the attack and the labeling of North Korea as a member of the ""axis of evil"" along with Iran and Iraq resulted in a retrenchment by North Korea and saber rattling by both sides. This created an awkward tensionbetween South Korea and the U.S. because of the desire by the South Korea for eventual reunification in accordance with the sunshine policy of President Kim Dee Jung of South Korea while at the same time looking to maintain a good relationship with the U.S.

The branding of North Korea as part of an ""axis of evil"" by the United States in 2002 appeared to have spurred (according to some, but not all, sources) the restarting of a nuclear program in the country, which reached a disturbing apex in 2006 when a nuclear weapon was tested. Despite assurances from the Chinese government in 2005 that it would push multi-party talks with North Korea, negotiations remained stalled. Nevertheless, talks resumed in December 2006 with the United States expressing cautious optimism on the matter of nuclear disarmament. *** Special Report:  North Korea's nuclear program Background The Korean peninsula has remained bitterly divided since the end of the Korean War in 1953. The demilitarized zone, which divides the two countries at the 38th parallel, is the world's most heavily fortified border. In 1953, the U.S. and South Korea signed a mutual defense treaty that commits the U.S. to defend South Korea against external threats. The U.S. currently has 37,000 troops in South Korea and several thousand more that could easily be deployed from U.S. bases in Japan. North Korea has the fourth largest military in the world. During the Cold War, North Korea received substantial military aid from the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union. North Korea was initially more economically developed than the South, largely due to its natural resources. However, the North's policy of economic self-reliance (juch'e) created dismal economic conditions. Much of North Korea's budgetary resources are devoted to the military. In the decades following the Korean War, South Korea's export-driven economy grew rapidly. As a result, South Korea has a much higher standard of living than the North. After the Cold War, North Korea began to generate income through drug trafficking, counterfeiting, money laundering, and exporting weapons to countries like Syria, Iran, and Pakistan. North Korea's nuclear program became a serious international issue in the early 1990s. Although North Korea joined the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) in 1985, its activities at its nuclear reactor in Yongbyon fueled suspicions that its nuclear program had non-civilian purposes. Despite signing the NPT, North Korea did not allow outside observers to inspect its nuclear facilities. Summary North Korea's nuclear program, which has likely yielded at least two nuclear bombs, is a major ongoing issue in global security. The discovery of a secret uranium enrichment program in North Korea in 2002 lead to the collapse of the 1994 Agreed Framework, which was supposed to dismantle North Korea's nuclear program. Since then, representatives from the United States (U.S.), North Korea, South Korea, Japan, China, and Russia have participated in ongoing negotiations known as the six-party talks with the aim of reaching an agreement to stop North Korea's program in exchange for a package of economic and security incentives. Although a provisional agreement was reached in September 2005, the talks were at an impasse. North Korea refused to participate until the U.S. lifts financial sanctions in place against its counterfeiting activities.  In July 2006, North Korea test fired a series of ballistic missiles, leading to a United Nations (U.N.) Security Council resolution condemning the tests and prohibiting U.N. member states from supplying North Korea with missile-related materials and technology. Despite international pressure to return to the six-party talks, North Korea was still refusing to return to the negotiations until its preconditions are met.  In October 2006, North Korea carried out an apparent test of a nuclear weapon. The international community responded to North Korea's announcement with widespread condemnation and a punitive U.N. Security Council resolution endorsing financial and security sanctions.  December 2006 marked the resumption of multilateral talks regarding North Korea's controversial nuclear program.  North Korea, South Korea, China, Japan, Russia and the United States indicated their return to the negotiating table after a year-long hiatus. While the news of the recommencement of  six-party talks was welcomed, there was also a pervasive sense of caution. Experts conveyed limited optimism about the prospects of forging a resolution amenable to all parties. Indeed, the United States has consistently expressed vociferous opposition to the notion of North Korea being a nuclear power, while North Korea has been equally adamant about its need for nuclear weapons.  These two absolutist positions have resulted in an impasse.  The December 2006 talks ended inconclusively and multilateral talks resumed again in January 2007.  By February 2007, the multilateral discussions saw some progress.  Of particular interest was an agreement  reportedly requiring Pyongyang to shut down its nuclear facilities  at Yongbyon over the course of the ensuing months, in lieu of aid, such as fuel oil provided by the United States and South Korea.  The draft agreement, which had been drafted by Chinese,  also called for the return of international inspectors to North Korea. Concurrence was forged days after talks began.  In June 2007, North Korea agreed to shut down its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon and, then, disable its nuclear facilities.  North Korea also noted that it was inviting International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors to return to North Korea to monitor the closure of its nuclear program and facilities.  To that end, IAEA inspectors were expected to visit North Korea on June 26, 2007, for the first time since their dismissal from that country in 2002.  These announcements came months after the Chinese drafted an agreement in February 2007 (as noted above), in which the closure of the reactor at Yongbyon would be secured, in lieu of heavy fuel oil that would be secured by other countries participating in the multilateral nuclear disarmament talks.The total amount of fuel oil -- one million metric tons -- appeared to more substantial that the original quantity discussed earlier in the year under the Chinese-brokered plan.  In addition, diplomatic recognition and humanitarian aid benefits were included in the deal.  Also included in the arrangement was the untangling of a financial dispute.A new round of six-party disarmament talks, which has included North Korea, South Korea, China, Japan, Russia and the United States, commenced in July 2007.In mid-July 2007, North Korea said that it shut down its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon and a team of inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was monitoring the situation at  there in order to verify Pyongyang's claim.In October 2007, South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun and the North Korea's leader Kim Jong-ilsigned a joint declaration calling for a permanent peace agreement on the Korean Peninsula.The eight-point declaration set forth an agenda for international dialogue aimed at crafting a treaty, which would replace the existing armistice that brought an end to the Korean War that took place from 1950 to 1953.  The declaration also came on the heels of a significant announcement by North Korea that it would end its nuclear ambitions.A year later  in June 2008 North Korea declared its nuclear assets.  In October 2008, the United States removed North Korea from its list of terrorism sponsors as part of the denuclearization agreement.At the end of that year, it was clear that North Korea's disarmament progress had stalled.  Then at the start of 2009, the United States reacted by suspending energy aid to North Korea. Soon thereafter, relations devolved between the two Koreas when the South Korean leader said that aid to the North would be dependent on that country's willingness to completely end its nuclear weapons program. North Korea accused South Korea of hostile intent and announced it was ending all political and military agreements with its neighbor to the south.April 2009 saw North Korea take provocative action by launching a communications satellite into space via rocket.  That claim was widely viewed as obfuscation of a missile test.Then, on May 25, 2009, less than three years after the earlier underground nuclear test, North Korea conducted a second such test, arguing the merits of its right to a military deterrent.  Prior to 2009, the last time North Korea conducted an underground nuclear test was in October 2006.By the end of the month, North Korea had fired a total of six short-range missiles and United States military officials warned that further missile launches were likely in the works.The international community reacted with outrage and condemnation to these collective actions. Not surprisingly, the UN Security Council rapidly reacted with a strenuous statement of condemnation, registering North Korea's contravention of the resolution, demanding that North Korea return to multilateral talks aimed at denuclearization, and reminding all member states that they must comply with sanctions imposed on North Korea.  The UN Security Council also made clear that further action, in the form of a new resolution with stronger measures, was in the offing.Meanwhile, North Korea announced its withdrawal from the armistice that ended the Korean War. In response to North Korea's decision to return to nuclear activities, new United Nations Security Council sanctions were put forth, and the United States  said that it does not rule out returning North Korea to its list of terrorism sponsors.  Clearly, multilateral negotiations including North Korea, South Korea, China, Japan, Russia, and the United States stalled.In the second week of June 2009, Russian officials warned that North Korea was close to test-firing  another ballistic missile.  Around the same time, the United Nations Security Council  imposed harsh new sanctions against North Korea in response to the nuclear test carried out in May 2009.  For its part, North Korea reacted to these developments by threatening to weaponize its stocks of plutonium.On July 2, 2009, North Korea test-fired four short-range surface-to-ship missiles  were fired into the Sea of Japan, which South Korea regards as the ""East Sea.""  The missile tests were not surprising as Pyongyang issued warnings to shipping vessels, urging them to avoid coastal waters.  Two days later, North Korea was suspected of firing another seven ballistic missiles.  These seven  Scud-type missiles were launched from an east coast base and, as before, fell into the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea. The timing of the missile tests coincided with the United States' celebration of its  Independence Day on July 4, 2009, and was regarded as a clear act of defiance against Washington.  Nevertheless, the United States was joined by Russia and China in calling for calm.  Japan and South Korea said that the missile launches constituted  an ""act of provocation.""By the autumn of 2009, tensions had cooled and North Korea was indicating interest in returning to the negotiating table while the United States was saying that it welcomed dialogue to resolve differences on the nuclear issue. There remained disagreement about whether negotiations would take place within a multilateral framework between North Korea and United States, with the former party insisting on such a position, and the latter party giving no sign that it would pursue such a track.But by October 2009, North Korea had fired five short-range missiles into Sea of Japan (also known as the East Sea).  The surface-to-surface KN-02 missiles with a range of 75 miles  were launched south of Musudan-ri in the North Hamgyeong Province.  It was the first missile launches by North Korea and came at a time when hopes were rising about that country's  return to multilateral talks about its nuclear program.In early 2010, North Korea said that peace deal should be forged at the foundation for denuclearization talks.  It was not known how nuclear talks would be affected by the firing of artillery shells into theYellow Sea in late January 2010, or, the diplomatic breakdown following the destruction of a South Korean warship, reportedly by the North Koreans.By mid-2010, the United States had announced that it was imposing new sanctions against North Korea. The announcement by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton came in the aftermath of her visit to the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) that separates North Korea from South Korea. Secretary of State Clinton explained that the sanctions would target North Korea's sale and purchase of arms, and were aimed at preventing nuclear proliferation and discouraging provocative actions by North Korea. For its part, North Korea warned that fresh sanctions would be interpreted as an act of war.See ""Current Initiative"" and  ""Special Entry"" and ""Update"" below for further developments from late 2010 to 2013.Foreign Policy Positions of Key PlayersNorth Korea -After the Cold War, North Korea has felt a greater degree of insecurity because it is no longer has access to Soviet military aid. Thus, its nuclear program can be seen as a security investment. North Korea has also felt threatened by what it views as an aggressive U.S. foreign policy. Having been included in President Bush's ""axis of evil"" speech and having witnessed the policy of preemption implemented in Iraq, North Korea may view its nuclear program as a way to guard against a U.S. attack. Some observers, however, argue that North Korea's real agenda is to blackmail the international community into giving it the resources it needs to prevent economic collapse, thereby ensuring the regime's survival. North Korea has demanded that negotiations take place in a bilateral context with the U.S. In June 2006, the day after Washington announced that it would be willing to hold talks with Iran over its nuclear program, North Korea invited U.S. envoy Christopher Hill to Pyongyang. North Korea has stated that it will not participate in the six-party talks again until the U.S. removes financial sanctions currently in place against its counterfeiting and money laundering operations, which have caused banks around the world to avoid dealing with North Korea. North Korea also wants the U.S. to provide a light-water nuclear reactor before it dismantles its nuclear program. The September 2005 agreement only stated that the issue of the reactors would be addressed at an ""appropriate time."" In July 2006, North Korea caused an international stir when it test fired seven missiles, and again in October 2006, when it apparently joined the ""nuclear club.""  Ties with the broader international community deteriorated further as a result, however, progress on nuclear disarmament presented a significant shift from 2007 through 2008.  As noted here, since 2009, North Korea has moved from negotiations to confrontation.South Korea -Since 1998, South Korea has pursued a ""sunshine policy"" of diplomatic and economic engagement with North Korea. Although South Korea has reason to fear a nuclear-armed North Korea, it nonetheless aims to prevent the regime's collapse, which it believes would produce a flood of refugees across the border and destabilize the security of the region. As a result, South Korea has been reluctant to apply sanctions or cut off its economic aid. South Korea prefers a less confrontational and less coercive strategy that places an emphasis on business investment. South Korea currently operates industrial complexes inside North Korea that it hopes will demonstrate the benefits of economic liberalization. The U.S. opposes continued aid and investment because it does not feel that South Korea adequately links such economic benefits to North Korea's progress on human rights and nonproliferation. South Korea has offered the North large amounts of electricity as an incentive to disarm. Following the July 2006 missile tests, South Korea suspended its food aid to North Korea and said that it would only resume if North Korea made progress on the missile tests and nuclear issues.  South Korea welcomed the new sanctions against the North following the nuclear test of October 2006.Ties between North Korea and the  international community deteriorated further as a result, however, progress on nuclear disarmament presented a significant shift from 2007 through 2008.  As noted here, since 2009, North Korea has moved from negotiations to confrontation, which it blames to some degree on South Korea's new leader, who has taken a more hardline approach in dealing with the North.  See above for details.United States -The crux of U.S. strategy toward North Korea is to encourage North Korea's neighbors in the region to place pressure on the regime. The George W. Bush administration has remained largely skeptical of South Korea's sunshine policy and has argued that the Agreed Framework amounted to extortion. The Bush administration has demanded that North Korea completely abandon its nuclear program before it receives any concessions. The U.S. has also rejected North Korea's calls for direct bilateral negotiations, although informal discussions between the two countries have occurred on the sidelines of the six-party talks. The U.S. currently has sanctions in place against financial institutions who have dealings with North Korean companies suspected of counterfeiting U.S. currency and money laundering. In May 2006, there were rumors that the U.S. would be willing to pursue bilateral talks on the subject of a peace treaty to replace the 1953 armistice even while six-party negotiations were still ongoing.Ties between North Korea and the broader international community deteriorated further as a result of an October 2006 nuclear test, however, progress on nuclear disarmament presented a significant shift from 2007 through 2008.  As noted here, since 2009, North Korea has moved from negotiations to confrontation with the United States backing strong international action in response.China -As North Korea's only ally in the region, China possesses an enormous ability to influence North Korea's behavior as a result of the economic and energy assistance it provides. Like South Korea, however, even though it seeks to prevent North Korea from developing nuclear weapons, China is reluctant to put too harsh of penalties on North Korea for fear that the regime will collapse and destabilize the region. China worries that the North Korean program could spark a regional arms race. In addition, China fears that it could lose its influence on the peninsula if the regime were to collapse as a result of military action or sanctions, especially if the U.S. or South Korea took charge in the interim. During Chinese President Hu Jintao's April 2006 visit to the U.S., President Bush urged China to exercise its ""considerable influence"" over North Korea to coerce the country back to the bargaining table. China has repeatedly urged North Korea to reform its economy. Kim Jong-Il has made several trips to China to tour high-tech centers with the aim of learning how a communist country can liberalize its economy while still maintaining an authoritarian regime. In July 2006, China froze North Korean assets in its banks because North Korea continued to counterfeit Chinese currency.  Like Russia, China joined the condemnation of the nuclear test of October 2006, and did not veto the U.N. resolution endorsing financial and security sanctions against North Korea, although it lobbied for the exclusion of enforcement through military means.  Ties between North Korea and the broader international community deteriorated further as a result of the nuclear test, however, progress on nuclear disarmament, thanks to a Chinese-brokered initiative, presented a significant shift from 2007 through 2008.  As noted here, since 2009, North Korea has moved from negotiations to confrontation.  While China has, to date, been a strong ally of North Korea and has eschewed harsh responses from the international community, it has nonetheless issued strong condemnation of North Korea's latest (as of 2009) actions.Japan -Japan sees North Korea as a major security concern, especially after North Korea tested a long-range ballistic missile over Japan in 1998. Another major ongoing sticking point in Japanese-North Korea relations is the issue of North Korea's abduction of Japanese citizens in the 1970s and 1980s. However, despite Japan's security concerns, it has been willing to engage in talks with North Korea about normalizing relations. Japan has also expressed a willingness to provide a substantial aid package as part of a broader agreement in part to compensate for its actions during its colonial occupation of the Korean peninsula prior to 1945. In February 2006, North Korean and Japanese officials met for formal talks on the normalization of diplomatic relations, economic assistance, and the fate of Japan's kidnapped citizens. To a large extent, the U.S. and Japan share similar positions on the North Korean issue. Following the July 2006 missile tests, Japan requested an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council and encouraged its members to adopt a strong resolution condemning the tests and to apply sanctions.  Japan took a similar approach following the events of October 2006.  Ties between North Korea and the broader international community deteriorated further as a result of the test, however, progress in negotiations and denuclearization  presented a significant shift from 2007 through 2008.  As noted here, since 2009, North Korea has moved from negotiations to confrontation, resulting in condemnation from Japan, which backs international action in response.Russia -During the Cold War, the Soviet Union was one of North Korea's most significant allies, providing the regime with extensive military and economic aid. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia went to considerable lengths to downgrade its strategic relationship with North Korea as it sought economic ties with South Korea. Perhaps in an attempt to expand its influence in East Asia, Russia has been an eager participant in the six-party talks. Russia believes it should play a significant role in the negotiations because, unlike the U.S., Japan, and South Korea, it has normal diplomatic relations with both sides of the dispute. However, since Russia has ceased providing North Korea aid, its actual leverage over Pyongyang is arguably somewhat limited. China is a much more significant trading partner with North Korea. Russia, like China and South Korea, aims to prevent the collapse of the regime in the North because of fears of a mass exodus of refugees across the (short) Russian border. Russia is against applying sanctions toward North Korea, believing that sanctions will not change the regime's behavior nor achieve a negotiated settlement. Moscow has encouraged Washington to engage in direct talks with Pyongyang. Following the July 2006 missile tests, Russia expressed its disappointment, but said that the tests were within North Korea's legal rights.  Like China, Russia joined the condemnation of the nuclear test of October 2006, and did not veto the U.N. resolution endorsing financial and security sanctions against North Korea, although it lobbied for the exclusion of enforcement through military means.Ties between North Korea and the broader international community deteriorated further as a result of the nuclear test, however, progress on nuclear disarmament, thanks to a Chinese-brokered initiative, presented a significant shift from 2007 through 2008.  As noted here, since 2009, North Korea has moved from negotiations to confrontation.  While Russia has, to date, been a strong ally of North Korea and has eschewed harsh responses from the international community, it has nonetheless issued strong condemnation of North Korea's latest  actions.Past InitiativesIn 1992, North and South Korea issued the Joint Declaration on the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula in which both countries pledged not to ""test, manufacture, produce, receive, possess, store, deploy or use nuclear weapons."" In response, the U.S. removed its tactical nuclear weapons from South Korea. The Joint Declaration was supposed to set up an inspections regime to monitor the compliance of both sides with regards to nuclear weapons. However, the declaration failed to end the nuclear dispute because North Korea denied International Atomic Energy Ahency (IAEA) inspectors access to some of its nuclear facilities, fueling more suspicions in the international community. The IAEA subsequently censured North Korea and referred the issue to the U.N. Security Council, which passed a resolution demanding North Korea's compliance. After North Korea rejected the Security Council's resolution, it banned IAEA inspectors from its facilities and announced its intention to withdraw from the NPT. Meanwhile, the U.S. formulated plans for a military strike against North Korea's nuclear reactor in Yongbyon, where the U.S. believed North Korea was reprocessing enough plutonium to make several bombs. North Korea then agreed to negotiate greater access for IAEA inspectors.In 1994, the U.S. and North Korea signed the Agreed Framework. Under the terms of the Framework, North Korea agreed to give up its plutonium program and allow IAEA inspections of its facilities in return for a package of incentives that included normalized diplomatic and economic relations with the U.S. The plan was to be administered by the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO), an international consortium funded by the U.S., Japan, and South Korea tasked with constructing two light-water nuclear reactors and providing fuel shipments to meet North Korea's energy needs.The implementation process for the Agreed Framework was delayed from the outset. North Korea soon insisted that the nuclear reactors it was promised in the agreement not come officially from South Korea, which caused a delay as KEDO sought downplay South Korea' role. In 1996, a North Korean submarine with 25 commandos came aground in South Korea. All were killed by each other or by South Korean forces. As a result, South Korea temporarily suspended its participation in the Agreed Framework. The U.S. also began to suspect that North Korea was developing an underground nuclear site in the late 1990s. In August 1998, North Korea tested its Taepodong-1 medium-range missile over Japan, sparking an international outcry. These incidents led the Clinton administration to delay lifting economic sanctions on North Korea as called for in the Agreed Framework. North Korea used these delays as proof that it was not the first party to violate the terms of the Agreed Framework.In 2002, the U.S. confronted North Korea with evidence of a secret uranium enrichment program. North Korea acknowledged the existence of the program, which was in violation of its obligations under the NPT, the 1992 declaration, and the Agreed Framework. At first North Korea defended its right to have nuclear weapons, but then offered to dismantle its program in exchange for non-aggression pact by the U.S. North Korea charged that the U.S. had violated the terms of the Agreed Framework, as the two light-water nuclear reactors under construction were years behind schedule. North Korea then restarted operations at its nuclear reactor in Yongbyon and subsequently withdrew from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and expelled IAEA inspectors. The KEDO executive board voted to suspend heavy fuel shipments and halt construction on the light-water reactors until the nuclear issue was satisfactorily resolved.Current Initiative: Six-Party TalksSince August 2003, the current negotiations about North Korea's nuclear program have taken place in the context of the six-party talks in Beijing. Thus far, there have been five rounds of negotiations. The first round in August 2003 failed to resolve the issue, although the delegates agreed to meet again. The second round began in February 2004 and also ended without an agreement. In June 2004, the third round began, this time with the U.S. offering to provide fuel to North Korea in return for disarmament. On February 2005, North Korea announced that it possessed nuclear weapons and stated it had no intention of continuing to participate in the six-party talks. In July 2005, North Korea agreed to return to the talks. In August 2005, no agreement had been made and the talks adjourned for a recess until the following month.In September 2005 the negotiations yielded a provisional agreement in which North Korea pledged to dismantle its nuclear program and rejoin the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. In return, the other countries offered North Korea a package of economic, diplomatic, and security incentives, including a non-aggression pledge by the U.S. However, the agreement did not specify whether North Korea needed to do this before or after it received its package of incentives. In order to achieve a preliminary agreement and break the impasse, the countries that signed the agreement each released statements describing their respective understandings of the accord. North Korea subsequently claimed that it was under no obligation to dismantle its nuclear program or rejoin the NPT until it received the light-water reactors it had been promised under the Agreed Framework. The U.S., however, flatly refused to grant North Korea any such concessions until it completely dismantled its nuclear program, rejoined the NPT, and allowed for IAEA inspections.In November 2005, the fifth round of six-party talks began. The U.S. and North Korea were unable to come to an agreement about what the terms of the September 20005 accord actually required of each party. North Korea's has refused to participate in any more talks until the U.S. removes financial measures in place designed to sanction North Korea for its involvement in money laundering and counterfeiting.After weeks of speculation, North Korea test fired at least seven short-, medium-, and long-range missiles in July 2006. Though the tests appear to have failed, they nonetheless provoked international condemnation. In mid-July, the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution condemning North Korea for testing the missiles and demanded that it cease activities related to its ballistic missile program. The resolution also prohibits U.N. members from providing North Korea with missile-related goods and technology. The resolution passed unanimously only after a reference to Chapter Seven of the U.N. charter, which would have authorized sanctions or military action and would have been legally binding, was removed. Russia and China had opposed binding sanctions. The resolution also urged North Korea to return to the six-party immediately and without preconditions. North Korea rejected the resolution.High-level talks between North and South Korean officials were cancelled as a result of the missile tests. South Korea suspended its shipments of food aid to the north, stating that they would not resume until North Korea made progress on the issues of the missile tests and its nuclear program. North Korea responded by suspending the visits of families separated across the DMZ. North Korea also cancelled plans to host a joint celebration of the anniversary of the Korean peninsula's liberation from Japanese rule.Also in July 2006, China froze North Korean assets in the Bank of China because North Korea continued to counterfeit Chinese currency. The move was tantamount to imposing economic sanctions on the regime, which China had previously not been willing to do.U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice expressed hope that the six-party talks would reconvene on the sidelines of an Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Regional Forum meeting in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in late July 2006. When North Korea again refused to participate until the U.S. lifted its financial sanctions, the other five countries involved in the six-party talks, in addition to Malaysia, Canada, and Australia, met to discuss the issue on the sidelines of the ASEAN Regional Forum meeting.In October 2006, North Korea said that it intended to test a nuclear weapon.  The international community, including China, strenuously urged North Korea not to do so.  Nevertheless, North Korea carried out an apparent test of a nuclear weapon. The international community responded to North Korea's announcement with widespread condemnation and a punitive U.N. Security Council resolution endorsing financial and security sanctions.  Resolution  1718 called for  the inspections on cargo going to and from North Korea to search for weapons, a ban on the sale or transfer of materials related to North Korea's unconventional weapons program, and a freeze on the transfer of funds connected with North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.  Absent from Resolution 1718 was the Chapter Seven [of the United Nations charter] provision, which would enforce the sanctions via military force. North Korea was also urged to return to multilateral talks.For its part, however, the North Korean government in Pyongyang decried Resolution 1718,  and warned that subsequent pressure by the United States would be regarded as  ""a declaration of war.""December 2006 marked the resumption of multilateral talks regarding North Korea's controversial nuclear program.  North Korea, South Korea, China, Japan, Russia and the United States indicated their return to the negotiating table after a year-long hiatus. While the news of the recommencement of  six-party talks was welcomed, there was also a pervasive sense of caution. Experts conveyed limited optimism about the prospects of forging a resolution amenable to all parties. Indeed, the United States has consistently expressed vociferous opposition to the notion of North Korea being a nuclear power, while North Korea has been equally adamant about its need for nuclear weapons.  These two absolutist positions have resulted in an impasse.  The December 2006 talks ended inconclusively and multilateral talks resumed again in January 2007.By February 2007, the multilateral discussions saw some progress.  Of particular interest was an agreement  reportedly requiring Pyongyang to shut down its nuclear facilities  at Yongbyon over the course of the ensuing months, in lieu of aid, such as fuel oil provided by the United States and South Korea.  The draft agreement, which had been drafted by Chinese,  also called for the return of international inspectors to North Korea. No concurrence was yet forged days after talks began.On February 13, 2007, it was announced that concurrence had been reached.  North Korea agreed to shut down its nuclear facilities at Yongbyon within 60 days in exchange for 50,000 tonnes of fuel oil or economic aid of equal value, with 950,000 tonnes of fuel oil or equivalent received after further disarmament steps are taken.As well, both Japan and the United States agreed to discuss the possibility of normalizing ties with North Korea -- something that Pyongyang has been seeking for some time.The United States also said that it would work with North Korea to resolve a banking dispute, and it would consider the prospects of removing North Korea from its list of state sponsors of terrorism.Yet to be seen was whether or not the agreement would be ratified by all six parties, and also whether or not North Korea would fully comply with the provisions of the deal.  For example, the state news agency of North Korea issued a report referring to the ""temporary"" suspension of nuclear activities, rather than enduring disarmament.  United States negotiator, Christopher Hill, warned that the resumption of nuclear activities in the future would be a clear violation of the agreement.In the third week of June 2007, North Korea reportedly agreed to shut down its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon and, then, disable its nuclear facilities.  North Korea also noted that it was inviting International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors to return to North Korea to monitor the closure of its nuclear program and facilities.  To that end, IAEA inspectors were expected to visit North Korea on June 26, 2007, for the first time since their dismissal from that country in 2002.These announcements came months after the aforementoned Chinese drafted an agreement in February 2007 in which the closure of the reactor at Yongbyon would be secured, in lieu of one million metric tons of heavy fuel oil that would be secured by other countries  participating in the multilateral nuclear disarmament talks.The total amount of fuel oil appeared to more substantial that the original quantity discussed earlier in the year under the Chinese-brokered plan.In addition, diplomatic recognition and humanitarian aid benefits were included in the deal.  These perks included possible normalization of ties between North Korea and Japan and the United States respectively, as well as the removal of North Korea from the United States' list of state sponsors of terrorism.Also included in the arrangement was the untangling of financial dispute.  At issue has been several millions of dollars, which were frozen in a bank in the Chinese domain of Macao in 2005, after the United States claimed that the funds had been acquired through illicit means.  The move resulted in several banks refusing to do business with North Korea out of fear of similar action being taken.  As such, North Korea had been adamant about linking satisfactory resolution of the financial dispute with the aforementioned nuclear disarmament agreement.  With the deal now moving forward, North Korea said that it would begin the process of shutting down operations at Yongbyon within weeks, pending receipt of the frozen funds. Russia, which worked to facilitate the complex transfer, said that the money was in the process of being delivered.North Korea characterized talks with United States nuclear envoy, Christopher Hill, on these matter as being both  ""comprehensive and productive.""  Hill responded to the developments positively but noted that the closure of the reactor at Yongbyon was only the start of an ongoing process, and would not solve all the problems at hand. Hill also said that a new round of six-party disarmament talks, which has included North Korea, South Korea, China, Japan, Russia and the United States, would commence in July 2007.In mid-July 2007, North Korea said that it shut down its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon.  A team of inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was monitoring the situation at Yongbyon in order to verify Pyongyang's claim.  Nevertheless, the announcement was welcomed by the countries of the West, the wider world, and particularly by the countries participating in multilateral talks with North Korea aimed at disarmament.In October 2007, North Korea said that it would end its nuclear ambitions.  To that end, Pyongyang formally agreed to a timetable for the disabling of its nuclear facilities.Pyongyang also agreed to disclose details about its nuclear program by the close of 2007. North Korea was scheduled to surrender its stockpile of nuclear weaponry in 2008.In October 2008, the United States removed North Korea from its list of terrorism sponsors as part of the denuclearization agreement.At the end of 2008, it was clear that North Korea;s disarmament progress had stalled.  Then at the start of 2009, the United States reacted by suspending energy aid to North Korea. Soon thereafter, relations devolved between the two Koreas when the South Korean leader said that aid to the North would be dependent on that country's willingness to completely end its nuclear weapons program. North Korea accused South Korea of hostile intent and announced it was ending all political and military agreements with its neighbor to the south.April 2009 saw North Korea take provocative action by launching a communications satellite into space via rocket.  That claim was widely viewed as obfuscation of a missile test.On May 25, 2009, less than three years after the earlier underground nuclear test, North Korea conducted a second such test, arguing the merits of its right to a military deterrent. Days later, North Korea announced its withdrawal from the armistice that ended the Korean War.  Meanwhile, multilateral negotiations including North Korea, South Korea, China, Japan, Russia, and the United States have remained stalled.See ""Special Entry""  and ""Update"" below for more details on the most recent developments related to North Korea's nuclear program.***Special Entry:North Korea conducts nuclear test in violation of UN Security Resolution 1718 and announces end of armistice; UN issues condemnation and a harsh sanctions regimeOn May 25, 2009, North Korea said that it had successfully conducted an underground nuclear test.  North Korea said that this test contained more explosive power than an earlier nuclear test conducted in 2006.Several independent entities confirmed that a powerful explosion had been registered,  resulting in the conclusion that it was caused by the nuclear test.  Indeed, the United States Geological Survey said that a 4.7 magnitude seismic tremor was detected underground and indicated a nuclear explosion of some kind.As well, the Russian Defense Ministry was also reported to have said it detected the explosion.  The actual location of the testing was unknown but South Korea noted that a seismic tremor had been detected in the north-eastern part of the country close to Kilju.  This was the area where North Korea's first nuclear test had been conducted.Geopolitical analysts were trying to determine why North Korea had chosen to move from negotiations to a clearly confrontational stance.  Two years earlier, North Korea agreed to close its nuclear facility at Yongbyong and comply with international monitoring of its nuclear assets.  In exchange, it was to be the recipient of a generous aid package.Later, however, North Korea withdrew from long-running multilateral negotiations and stopped inspectors from monitoring  progress related to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.There was some speculation that after a woeful harvest, with up to a quarter of the North Korean population in desperate need of food aid, according to the World Food Programme, Pyongyang may have been trying to divert attention from this internal crisis.  There was also some suggestion that the domestic worries may have prompted an internal power struggle, which ultimately may have spurred this action by hard-liner within the regime.For its part, Pyongyang appeared to indicate its motive via a communique announced on state radio, which asserted that the underground nuclear testing had been ""successfully conducted... as part of measures to enhance the Republic's self-defensive nuclear deterrent in all directions.""  The statement went on to note that the test was intended to ""contribute to safeguard the sovereignty of the country and the nation and socialism.""  Pyongyang also offered assurances that the underground nuclear testing had ensued in a safe manner with advanced technology.International news agencies reported that in addition to the underground nuclear test, North Korea also test-fired two short-range missiles.  There were reports that the test firing of these missiles was aimed at disrupting the ability of United States' surveillance of the nuclear testing.The international community reacted with outrage and condemnation to these collective actions, which occurred  just a month after North Korea test fired a long-range missile capable of reaching Asia as well as parts of the United States.Crisis talks were convened by Japan and South Korea respectively.  A spokesman for South Korean President Lee Myung-bak said that North Korea's decision to conduct nuclear testing  was a ""grave challenge"" to international non-proliferation efforts.  Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Takeo Kawamura deemed the path embarked on by North  as ""unacceptable.""United States President Barack Obama said that the action by North Korea was a threat to international peace and stability.  He warned, ""The danger posed by North Korea's threatening activities warrants action by the international community.""  The American president observed that North Korea was ""not only deepening its own isolation it's also inviting stronger international pressure.""United Kingdom Prime Minister Gordon Brown said North Korea's nuclear activities ""undermine prospects for peace on the Korean peninsula.""One of North Korea's closest allies, China, joined the wider international realm in decrying the nuclear testing.  The Chinese Foreign Ministry issued a statement that read: ""China expresses a resolute protest against new nuclear weapons tests carried out by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, in defiance of the objections voiced by the world community.""  The Chinese government also demanded that North Korea to honor its obligations related to denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.  At the wider level China  called for peaceful and calm dialogue to resolve the burgeoning crisis.Another of North Korea's closest allies, Russia, closed ranks with Western powers in denouncing North Korea's actions.  The chairman of the State Duma Defense Committee, Viktor Zavarzin, echoed the words of United States President Obama.  Zavarzin said, ""The actions of the North Korean leadership can be described as threatening international peace and security. The whole world community should be involved in resolving this problem, in particular within the framework of the UN Security Council.""Russia, which was at the helm of the rotating presidency, called for an emergency session of the United Nations (UN) Security Council, noting that North Korea had violated UN Security Council Resolution 1718.In fact, the Russian Foreign Ministry categorically rebuked North Korea's actions in a statement that read: ""We cannot describe the North Korean move other than as a breach of UN Security Council resolution 1718, which prohibits Pyongyang from carrying out nuclear tests.""  The statement continued, ""The North Korean nuclear test has a serious impact on international efforts aiming to strengthen the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and breaches the international regime provided by the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.""Indeed, UN Security Council Resolution 1718 exists in tandem with Article 41 of Chapter VII of the UN Charter and compels compliance by all member states.  A nuclear test would be an unassailable violation of UN Security Resolution 1718, which itself imposed sanctions in North Korea after it conducted a previous test in 2006.Not surprisingly, the UN Security Council rapidly reacted with a strenuous statement of condemnation, registering North Korea's contravention of the resolution, demanding that North Korea return to multilateral talks aimed at denuclearization, and reminding all member states that they must comply  with sanctions imposed on North Korea.  The UN Security Council also made clear that further action, in the form of a new resolution with stronger measures, was in the offing.After the emergency meeting of the UN Security Council, Vitaly Churkin -- Russian envoy to the UN and the current president of the body -- made clear that work on the new resolution would start immediately.  He said, ""The members of the Security Council have decided to start work immediately on a Security Council resolution on this matter, in accordance with the Security Council's responsibilities under the Charter of the United Nations.""United States Ambassador to the UN, Susan Rice, also said that the formulation of a new resolution with more stringent measures would commence right away.  Rice said, ""The US thinks that this is a grave violation of international law and a threat to regional and international peace and security. And therefore the United States will seek a strong resolution with strong measures.""On May 27, 2009, the North Korean military announced that it was abandoning the armistice that brought an end to Korean War.The North Korean military said that this action was being taken in response to South Korea's decision to participate in  the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI).  North Korea said that South Korea's decision to join PSI --  a United States-led effort to patrol the oceans in search of nuclear weapons -- was tantamount to a ""declaration of war"" and promised military action if its shipping vessels were intercepted.  In another development, South Korean media reported that steam had been observed emanating from North Korea's nuclear plant at Yongbyon -- a sign indicating North Korea had decided to recommence the manufacture of weapons-grade plutonium.By the end of the month, North Korea had fired a total of six short-range missiles and United States military officials warned that further missile launches were likely in the works.  Military officials in Washington D.C. said that satellite photographs indicated activity at a facility from which North Korea has in the past fired long-range missiles.  Meanwhile, with the UN Security Council contemplating action in response to North Korea's nuclear test days earlier, Pyongyang warned that it could take ""self defense"" actions if sanctions were imposed.In the first week of June 2009, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that North Korea could well be reinstated on her country's list of countries viewed as sponsors of terrorism.  With some politicians in the United States calling for such a response, the country's top diplomat said, ""Well, we're going to look at it. There's a process for it. Obviously we would want to see recent evidence of their support for international terrorism.""North Korea was removed from the terror list in October 2008 when it was compliant with a denuclearization agreement brokered via multilateral talks.  But North Korea's recent decisions to pursue nuclear activities, manifest most blatantly in an underground nuclear test, as well as a volley of short-range missile tests, have rendered that agreement functionally void.Secretary of State Clinton observed, ""Obviously they were taken off of the list for a purpose and that purpose is being thwarted by their actions.""Secretary of State Clinton also warned that North Korea was likely to face harsh consequences from the United Nations, as the international body contemplated a new resolution against North Korea.  To that end, Clinton said, ""  We think we're going to come out of this with a very strong resolution with teeth that will have consequences for the North Korean regime.""  She continued, ""If we do not take significant and effective action against the North Koreans now, we'll spark an arms race in North-East Asia.""In the second week of June 2009, Russian officials warned that North Korea was close to test-firing  another ballistic missile.  The Russian military reportedly claimed that it had accessed information pertaining to the type of rocker to be launched although it was unaware of a specific launch date.  This claim was somewhat supported by reports that North Korea warned shipping vessels to stay away from its east coast waters for a period for three weeks.Meanwhile, the United States special envoy to North Korea, Stephen Bosworth, said in an address to the Korea Society in New York that his government was considering stronger responses to the challenges posed by North Korea's recent missile activities.  He said, ""North Korea's recent actions to develop a nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile capacity require that we expand our consideration of new responses.""  He continued, ""However, the North Korean claim to be responding to a 'threat' or a 'hostile policy' by the United States is simply groundless. Quite to the contrary, we have no intention to invade North Korea or change its regime through force, and this has been made clear to the DPRK repeatedly.""Among the possible responses being considered by the United States were financial sanctions, as well as tougher inspections of shipping vessels in waters surrounding North Korea.  Related to these possible moves was the unanimous decision by the United Nations Security Council to impose harsh new sanctions against North Korea in response to the nuclear test carried out in May 2009.  Included in the new sanctions regime was the expected provision for the increased inspection of North Korean cargo not only on shipping vessels, but also on land and by air, and it authorized the destruction of any materials suspected of being linked to weapons of mass destruction. The new sanctions regime also expanded the arms embargo against North Korea, effectively prohibiting the sale of heavy and small arms by North Korea.Rosemary DiCarlo, the United States deputy ambassador at the United Nations said: ""North Korea chose a path of provocation. This resolution will give us new tools to impair North Korea's ability to proliferate, and to threaten international stability.""  In a rare show of solidarity with the international powers against North Korea, China said the measures showed that the world opposed Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions.  Indeed, Chinese ambassador Zhang Yesui said: ""We strongly urge the DPRK (North Korea) to honor its commitment to de-nuclearization, stop any moves that may further worsen the situation, and return to the six-party talks.""  He also rebuked North Korea for jeopardizing regional security by carrying out the nuclear test.For its part, North Korea reacted to these developments by threatening to weaponize its stocks of plutonium.  United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that this threat by Pyongyang was both ""provocative"" and ""deeply regrettable.""  She warned that the move would serve only to isolate North Korea even further from the wider international community.By the third week of June 2009,  reports emerged about a long range missile launch by North Korea -- quite possibly in the direction of Hawaii. United States President Barack Obama said in an interview with CBS News: ""This administration - and our military - is fully prepared for any contingencies.""The American president dismissed the notion that it was warning of a military response against North Korea.  But he also said, ""I don't want to speculate on hypotheticals.  But I do want to give assurances to the American people that the T's are crossed and the I's are dotted.""In other developments, United States President Barack Obama  renewed his country's sanctions -- separate from the United Nations sanctions -- against North Korea.  President Obama explained that North Korea's nuclear development combined with threats posed a national security risk to the United States and destabilized the region of eastern Asia. The American president also said his administration would end the cycle of responding to North Korean nuclear threats by granting concessions and incentives to Pyongyang.Around the same time, the United States, North Korea's neighbors and the wider international community were all  bracing for a possible missile launch by Pyongyang in the direction of Hawaii -- a presumed act of retaliation for the new sanctions.  Earlier, President Obama had said that the United States military was prepared to deal with any of contingencies posed by  a possible North Korean missile launch.On July 2, 2009, North Korea test-fired four short-range missiles.  According to South Korea's Yonhap News Agency,  two surface-to-ship missiles had been fired from the port of Wonsan while the other two were launched  from Sinsang-ni.  All four were fired into the Sea of Japan, which South Korea regards as the ""East Sea.""  The missile tests were not surprising as Pyongyang issued warnings to shipping vessels, urging them to avoid coastal waters.  Two days later, North Korea was suspected of firing another seven ballistic missiles.  These seven  Scud-type missiles were launched from an east coast base and, as before, fell into the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea.The timing of the missile tests coincided with the United States' celebration of its  Independence Day on July 4, 2009, and was regarded as a clear act of defiance against Washington.  Nevertheless, the United States was joined by Russia and China in calling for calm.  Russia and China urged North Korea to return to the negotiating table and said all parties should work to avoid further destabilization of the region.  The United States also said that the tense situation should not be exacerbated. Using highly restrained language, a United States Department of State official said the volley of missile tests were ""not helpful"" and said that North Korea should not ""aggravate tensions"" but instead ""focus on denuclearization talks.""  While British Foreign Secretary David Miliband echoed this sentiment by saying that tensions on the Korean peninsula should remain ""at manageable levels,"" Japan and South Korea struck a somewhat harsher tone in saying that the missile launches constituted  an ""act of provocation.""Later in August 2009, North Korea deployed envoys to the United States to meet with New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson.  The seasoned diplomat, Richardson,  served as United Nations ambassador and Energy Secretary under the Clinton administration in the 1990s, and was responsible for helping to broker an agreement with the North Koreans that brought a temporary end to its nuclear development.Following his meeting with the North Koreans, Governor Richardson, a Democrat who endorsed Barack Obama for president, said that believed that Pyongyang had issued ""good signals"" that pointed toward the restarting of dialogue with Washington.  Indeed, multilateral talks on North Korea's controversial nuclear program had stalled in recent times, and relations became increasingly strained after North Korea went forward with an underground nuclear, followed by a succession of missile tests.  Now, however, in the aftermath of a successful but unofficial trip by former President Bill Clinton to North Korea to secure the release of two American journalists, Governor Richardson said that he believed the climate had improved.  Indeed, Governor Richardson said that he indicated a ""thaw"" in relations and believed that North Korea was ""ready for a new dialogue with the United States regarding the nuclear issue.""That said, an actual diplomatic breakthrough was still in the offing. According to Governor Richardson, North Korea remained intransigent on the issue of returning to six-party talks. Instead,  Pyongyang believed that it had earned some goodwill and wanted to pursue direct bilateral talks with the United States.  To this end, Governor Richardson said that Pyongyang had ""obviously used the journalists as a bargaining chip"" and was looking for a reciprocal  a ""gesture"" from Washington.The Obama administration has indicated that while it was willing to return to the negotiating table with North Korea within the multilateral framework, with an eye on irreversible denuclearization, it would not soon engage in direct talks.  State Department spokesman, Ian Kelly, said:  ""Our goal is the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. And, of course, we want to see progress toward that.""After the meeting between the Governor Richardson and the North Korean envoys, North Korea invited the United States envoy to North Korea, Stephen Bosworth, for direct negotiations on its nuclear program.  South Korea media reported that there were rumblings about the White House giving serious consideration to the idea of actually sending Bosworth to North Korea. But on the record, the United States embassy in Seoul would offer no comment on the matter.On  October 12, 2009, North Korea fires five short-range missiles into Sea of Japan (also known as the East Sea).  The surface-to-surface KN-02 missiles with a range of 75 miles  were launched south of Musudan-ri in the North Hamgyeong Province.  As a precaution, North Korea had banned shipping vessels from the waters off the east and west coasts from October 10 to October 20, 2009, according to the Yonhap news agency.  It was the first missile launches by North Korea  in several months  and came after North Korea said that it was willing to return to multilateral talks about its nuclear program.On Dec. 12, 2009, Thailand seized a cargo plane that was said to be carrying 40 tons of weapons from North Korea to an unknown destination. The chartered Soviet-designed Il-76 aircraft, which originated in the North Korean capital city of Pyongyang,  was refueling at the Bangkok airport when it was intercepted by the Thai military. The ensuing raid of the aircraft resulted in the uncovering of missiles, rocket-propelled grenades and other weapons.  As well, five crew members -- four from Kazakhstan and one from Belarus -- were detained and taken into Thai custody. The Thai authorities said they were acting as a result of a tip from foreign intelligence.  Reuters reported that the source was actually United States intelligence, based on information supplied by an anonymous source.  Reuters quoted that anonymous source as saying: ""It [the plane] came from North Korea and was heading for somewhere in South Asia, probably Pakistan.""While another news report stated the aircraft was headed on to Sri Lanka, geopolitical analysts suggested that the Indian Ocean island might not have been the ultimate destination.Thai Deputy Prime Minister Suthep Thaungsuban confirmed that the weapons had been found aboard the aircraft and that a transparent investigation was in the offing. Indeed, such an investigation was likely to have international effects since the United Nations increased sanctions against North Korea earlier in the year in response to controversial nuclear testing.  Those sanctions expressly addressed the transshipment of weaponry.  But impoverished North Korea derives much of its revenue from arms sales to countries in the Middle East.UpdateBy early 2010, North Korea indicated that part of the new phase of negotiations on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula should include a new peace treaty to replace the armistice that ended the Korean War.  North Korea said that a peace agreement should form the fulcrum of  negotiations on this matter and should be addressed prior to the return to six-party talks aimed at ending Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program, or, as a central part of those multilateral negotiations.  In a statement published by North Korea's state-run news agency, the North Korean Foreign Ministry said: ""If a peace treaty is signed, it will help resolve hostile relations between North Korea and the United States and speed up the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.""  North Korea also called for an end to the United Nations sanctions, which were  imposed after it conducted  nuclear and ballistic missile tests in 2009.  North Korean officials said that its return to the negotiating table was contingent upon the lifting of those sanctions.On January 29, 2010, North Korea reportedly fired artillery shells in the area of the Yellow Sea, close to the country's  maritime border with South Korea.  It was third day that North Korea had carried out such action, according to the South Korean military.  Speculation abounded that the provocative action by North Korea may have been aimed at forcing the United States and South Korea to respond to its proposal for a peace treaty to officially end the Korean War, which has effectively ceased via a prevailing armistice rather than an actual peace agreement.  North Korea has argued that it cannot advance further denuclearization talks without the foundation of a peace treaty.In June 2010, South Korea had referred North Korea to the United Nations over the matter of a torpedoed warship. At issue was the sinking of its Cheonan warship months earlier, which an international investigation ultimately blamed on North Korea despite Pyongyang's denial of culpability.In the third week of July 2010, the United States (U.S.) announced that it was imposing new sanctions against North Korea. The announcement by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton came in the aftermath of her visit to the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) that separates North Korea from South Korea. Secretary of State Clinton explained that the sanctions would target North Korea's sale and purchase of arms, and were aimed at preventing nuclear proliferation and discouraging provocative actions by North Korea.As one the most sanctioned countries in the world, these new sanctions were likely intended to intensify the pressure on North Korea in response to the Cheonan incident. In fact, as indicated by Secretary of State Clinton, they were aimed at compelling Pyongyang to take responsibility for the sinking of the warship that left 47 dead. For its part, North Korea warned that fresh sanctions would be interpreted as an act of war.In late October 2010, North Korean and South Korean troops exchanged fire across the border. According to accounts from authorities in Seoul, North Korean troops fired two rounds in the direction of a front line unit at Hwacheon, prompting South Korean troops to return fire. No further exchange of fire followed the incident and there were no injuries to South Korean troops. There was no consensus as to whether or not North Korea's actions constituted a direct provocation.  Only days later on November 3, 2010, South Korea's navy fired warning shots at a North Korean fishing vessel in  maritime border waters.In the last week of November 2010, an exchange of fire occurred between North Korean and South Korean forces, leaving two South Korean marines dead, 16 other South Korean marines injured, and three civilians wounded.  At issue was the shelling of the inhabited Yeonpyeong Island by North Korea, located in close proximity the disputed  Yellow Sea maritime border, just off the North Korean coast.  South Korea, whose military was conducting military exercises in the waters off Yeonpyeong Island, reportedly  returned fire, spurring one of the most serious clashes between the North and the South since the Korean War.  Some fifty shells reportedly landed on the island, largely hitting a South Korean military base in the area.  South Korea returned a fire with about 80 shells; the casualties on the north side of the border were not known.South Korean President Lee Myung-bak convened  a meeting of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the capital city of Seoul.  Following the meeting, he announced that the South Korean military would punish North Korea for its attack, adding that it was vital that Pyongyang not engage in further provocation.For its part, Pyongyang placed the blame on South Korea for igniting the clashes. It should be noted that Seoul disputes the North Korean version of the events that transpired. Nevertheless, according to the state-run KCNA news agency, ""The South Korean enemy, despite our repeated warnings, committed reckless military provocations of firing artillery shells into our maritime territory near Yeonpyeong Island.""  The North, therefore, was prepared to strike back if South Korea ""dares to invade our sea territory.""United States President Barack Obama characterized the incident an ""outrageous, provocative act"" by North Korea. Russia struck a similar tone with Russian  Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warning of a ""colossal danger""  and characterizing those responsible for the clashes as carrying a huge responsibility.  The European Union also added its voice to the litany of condemnations. Japanese Prime Minister, Naoto Kan, took a defensive stance in the national interests of his country, saying that his government had to prepare for the occurrence of ""any unexpected event.""But China, North Korea's closest ally, offered a murky suggestion that the two Koreas should ""do more to contribute to peace.""  A spokesperson for the Chinese government also called for restarting  six-party negotiations on North Korea's nuclear program -- a prospect that seemed practically unlikely, given these latest developments.  Indeed, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency, President Lee Myung-bak was reported to have informed a visiting Chinese foreign policy adviser, Dai Bingguo, that his country (South Korea) was not interested in the resumption of the multilateral nuclear talks; the South Korean leader apparently emphasized the importance of immediately dealing with North Korea's aggressive actions of late.In another development, South Korean Defense Minister Kim Tae-young came under fire for ignoring intelligence reports that alerted his country of possible attacks from the North, as well as the country's slow and weak responses to the threat posed by Pyongyang.  Perhaps not surprisingly, he was forced to resign from his post.To date, there have been occasional flare ups in the border regions since the Korean War ended without a  peace treaty in 1953.  However, the attack on Yeonpyeong Island  occurred at a time of increased tensions between the two Koreas. Months earlier in March 2010, as discussed above, South Korea accused North Korea of torpedoing one of its warships  in the area of the western maritime border, also known as the Northern Limit Line. For its part, North Korea has denied that charge and has also insisted that South Korea engage in diplomatic talks with Pyongyang aimed at easing tensions, or, deal with ""catastrophic"" consequences. Then, in late October 2010, as discussed above, North Korean and South Korean troops exchanged fire across the border. According to accounts from authorities in Seoul, North Korean troops fired two rounds in the direction of a front line unit at Hwacheon, prompting South Korean troops to return fire. No further exchange of fire followed the incident and there were no injuries to South Korean troops. There was no consensus as to whether or not North Korea's actions constituted a direct provocation. Only days later on November 3, 2010, South Korea's navy fired warning shots at a North Korean fishing vessel in maritime border waters.At the time, South Korea  sought to downplay the incidences or the prospects of trouble emanating from the North. Indeed, during a news conference focused on an impending summit in Seoul, South Korean President Lee Myung-bak had said, ""I don't think the North will try to do anything when leaders of the international community are meeting to discuss the world economy."" He continued, ""I trust the North won't do anything but still we are fully prepared.""On the other side of the border, while North Korea has a history of making provocative moves, many analysts said that it was unlikely that Pyongyang would seek to alienate the international community, especially at a time when it has been revealing its new leadership succession team to the world. Earlier, President Kim Jong-il's son was given a military promotion, and sanctioned as the likely successor to the ailing leader. Of course, as illustrated by the events in late November 2010 on Yeonpyeong Island, it was apparent that the path of provocation was the one being traversed by North Korea.Attention was on the matter of why North Korea would seek to heighten the state of volatility on the Korean Peninsula.  Perhaps, for North Korea, this is a simple matter of defending its interests.  However, it could well be that the aforementioned analysts interpreted the matter of leadership transition incorrectly.  It could well be that North Korea is not concerned with the matter of alienating the international community. Instead, at this time of leadership transition from ailing President Kim Jong-il to his son, the priority from Pyongyang is to establish North Korea's power, and to show the military elite in North Korea that the named successor is not afraid to embrace a muscular stance in relation to the South, and indeed, the world.The situation on the Korean peninsula has been made more complicated by the November 2010 revelation that North Korea constructed a  new nuclear facility. A nuclear scientist from Stanford University in the United States, Dr. Siegfried Hecker, said that during a visit to North Korea, he was shown a new nuclear facility.  There -- at the new nuclear facility at the Yongbyon nuclear complex to the north of the capital of Pyongyang -- he viewed ""more than 1,000 centrifuges"" for enriching uranium -- elements needed for the production of nuclear weapons.Since  the nuclear facility did not exist when international nuclear weapons inspectors were expelled from North Korea in 2009, it was clear that it had been constructed quickly.  But Dr. Hecker noted that the facility boasted a high level of sophistication, and as reported in the New York Times, it included an ""ultra-modern control room.""  According to Dr. Hecker, the facility appeared oriented for the use of civilian nuclear power.  Noting that there was no sign of plutonium production, which is needed for weapons proliferation, Dr. Hecker nonetheless cautioned in an interview with the Associated Press that the new facility could be ""readily converted to produce highly enriched uranium bomb fuel.""Dr. Hecker additionally  shored up previous reports that North Korea has been constructing a light-water nuclear  reactor.  His observations on the ground in North Korea appeared to coincide with satellite imagery depicting the construction of the reactor at Yongbyon.  Typically, light-water reactors are associated with civilian energy usage, however, uranium  enrichment is part of the process, it was not inconceivable that further enrichment could potentially ensue at weapons-grade levels.To date, North Korea is believed to have sufficient weaponized plutonium for about six atomic bombs, although there has been little evidence to suggest that the country has actively pursued a weapons program.  That being said, Western powers have been advocating a resumption of the stalled six-party talks dealing with North Korea's nuclear program.In November 2010, a senior United States Department of State envoy, Stephen Bosworth, was in Asia on a trip aimed at reviving the multilateral negotiations. However, this latest act of provocation by North Korea on Yeonpyeong Island left the United States with no choice but to disengage from the multilateral diplomatic process, essentially ruling out the resumption of six-party talks on North Korea's nuclear disarmament for the foreseeable future.On Nov. 23, 2010, in an interview with ABC News, United States President Barack Obama characterized North Korea's shelling of Yeonpyeong Island as ""a serious and ongoing threat that needs to be dealt with. President Obama also reaffirmed his country's alliance with South Korea, describing that country as an important ally. He said, ""We strongly affirm our commitment to defend South Korea as part of that alliance."" The United States president also noted, ""We want to make sure all the parties in the region recognize that this is a serious and ongoing threat that needs to be dealt with."" This statement appeared to target China, as he continued saying that Pyongyang needs to know ""that there are a set of international rules they need to abide by.""By the close of November 2010, tensions on the Korean peninsula remained high, as South Korea and the United States carried out joint military exercises in the Yellow Sea, to the south of the disputed maritime border. North Korea said it viewed the previously -arranged military exercises as a provocation and warned of retaliation if there was any violation of its territorial waters. A statement from Pyongyang broadcast by the state-controlled KCNA news agency read as follows: ""We will deliver a brutal military blow on any provocation which violates our territorial waters.""At the start of December 2010, South Korea took a highly assertive position. The South Korean defense minister-designate, Kim Kwan-jin, warned that North Korea would face a harsh response, including air strikes, if it dared to act aggressively in the future. Kim Kwan-jin's remarks were made in parliament as he answered questions during his confirmation hearing. In response to the question of how he would react to another violent action by North Korea, Kim Kwan-jin said, ""If North Korea provokes again, we will definitely use aircraft to attack North Korea."" Clearly, this posture by South Korea was a marked departure from its long-held restraint in the face of North Korea's provocations. Making clear that it intended to maintain this assertive posture, South Korea also said that it was going to carry out military drills from the aforementioned Yeonpyeong Island, even though North Korea has condemned those plans and warned that it would retaliate with force. With Pyongyang and Seoul at odds with one another in such a marked fashion, there were heightened anxieties about the renewal of war on the Korean peninsula.Yet even with those fears at hand, the landscape became even more complicated when in mid-December 2010, South Korea said that it suspected North Korea of secretly enriching uranium at locations beyond its main nuclear site at Yongbyon.  South Korean Foreign Minister Kim Sung-hwan would not confirm a media report that North Korea was home to three more plants where uranium enrichment could take place, however, he admitted to having suspicions along these lines. During a news conference, he said, ""It is a report based on what is still intelligence and let me just say that we have been following this issue for some time."" Should this claim be proved correct, North Korea could conceivably possess material -- potentially for building more nuclear bombs. Moreover, such actions would fly in the face of renewed nuclear disarmament talks, which were already on a downward slide as a result of North Korea's latest aggressive actions (as discussed above).By the third week of December 2010, intense dissonance characterized relations on the Korean peninsula for the myriad reasons discussed above. Former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, who also served as ambassador to the United Nations, was acting as an unofficial United States envoy in the region, with an eye on reducing the level of tensions. That job, however, was not helped when United Nations meetings on the matter ended with no resolution. Nevertheless, there were signs of progress when North Korea began to reverse course, effectively moving away from its threats to take retaliatory action against South Korea for the aforementioned military drills. The shift from Pyongyang came after South Korea evacuated residents from the area on and around Yeonpyeong Island and launched fighter jets from its terrain. Analysts surmised that the strong stance from South Korea may have forced North Korea to rethink the likely consequences of making good on expressed threats. As explained by Governor Richardson, ""South Korea was able to flex its muscles, and North Korea reacted in a statesmanlike manner.""  But despite these encouraging indications, on Dec. 23, 2010, the rhetoric between the two Koreas was on the rise once again. South Korea's president was promising harsh retaliation if his country was again attacked, while  North Korean was warning of a ""sacred"" nuclear war, if provoked.Meanwhile, Governor Richardson -- a seasoned diplomat -- who has had years of experience negotiating with the North Koreans, announced that North Korea was willing to offer concessions in regard to their nuclear program. In an interview with the Associated Press, Governor Richardson said, ""We had positive results."" He continued, ""I hope this will signal a new chapter and a round of dialogue to lessen tension on the Korean peninsula."" Given the increasing concerns about North Korea's capacity to build nuclear bombs, this development was welcomed. But, as United States Department of State spokesman, P.J. Crowley, cautioned, ""North Korea talks a great game. They always do. The real issue is what will they do. If they are agreeable to returning IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] inspectors to their country, they need to tell the IAEA that.""In a New Year's message at the close of 2010, North Korea appeared to strike a conciliatory note as it called for dialogue with South Korea. North Korea was reported to have called for ""a lasting peace system on the Korean Peninsula,"" which it said should be made ""nuclear-free through dialogue and negotiations."" Heightened tensions have marked relations between the two Koreas since the sinking of a South Korean warship by the North earlier in 2010, and reached a nadir at the close of the year, following the shelling of Yeonpyeong Island (under South Korean jurisdiction) by the North. For its part, Seoul opted to take a more aggressive stance in relation to Pyongyang since these events by carrying out military exercises in the border zones and increasing its rhetoric. Now, the call for improved relations by Pyongyang may have been interpreted as a shift in stance, aimed at lowering tensions on the Korean peninsula. However, Pyongyang's message, which was publicized via North Korean state media, went onto to warn of increased military strength. The New Year's message said that North Korea's military would ""conduct intense combat training in an atmosphere of actual battle as required by the tense situation.""On Feb. 9, 2011, bilateral talks between the two Koreas were reported to have broken down.  Delegates from North Korea and South Korea had been meeting in  the border village of Panmunjom with the intent of working through a number of sensitive cross-border issues.  There were hopes that the security talks would ease tensions between the two Koreas, which reached a nadir after the shelling of a South Korean island by North Korean forces in November 2010.  Significantly, these discussions were intended to set the foundation for further, higher-level, negotiations.  However, the disintegration of these talks meant that there was no consensus on an agenda for future meetings.In July 2011, some good news was brewing in the realm of foreign relations. The United States and North Korea completed a set of exploratory discussions, which North Korea's envoy, Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye Gwan, characterized as positive.  Speaking of his meetings with United States Ambassador Stephen Bosworth, the Obama administration's leading representative on North Korean affairs, Kim Kye Gwan said, ""Yesterday and today we discussed comprehensively, with Mr. Bosworth, matters of mutual interest. The talks were very constructive and businesslike and we continue to maintain contacts.""  For his part, Ambassador Bosworth said, ""These discussions are designed to explore the willingness of North Korea to take concrete and irreversible steps toward denuclearization."" These bilateral talks were intended to be a precursor to the resumption of multilateral denuclearization  negotiations.  To that end, Ambassador Bosworth said that his country would enter consultations with  South Korea and other countries involved multilateral negotiations that have been ongoing for years, to consider how to proceed further with North Korea.Later in August 2011, though, prospects for a return to multilateral talks were dimmed when an imbroglio ensued between North Korea and South Korea.  The situation was spurred when shells from North Korea were fired close to the maritime border with South Korea.  In response, the South Korean navy  fired warning shots towards North Korea. According to South Korean sources, artillery shells from North Korea landed in the Yellow Sea close to Yeonpyeong Island, which is under Seoul's jurisdiction.  Further rounds were fired on the same day.  Defense officials from South Korea  surmised that the initial firing of shells may have been due to training exercises by North Korea.  Nevertheless, South Korea wasted no time in responding with warning shots. It should be noted that Yeonpyeong Island was in the global purview in late 2010 when North Korea fired shells in that direction, leaving four people dead and triggering the outrage of South Korea and its allies.As the month drew to a close, tension increased when five South Koreans were arrested for spying on behalf of North Korea.  South Korean prosecutors said that the five individuals conveyed sensitive  military and political information to the North over a period of two decades.  Among the sensitive material were satellite images of major military installations, as well as field manuals of United States forces in South Korea.  All five individuals were accused by South Korean authorities of violating the country's  national security law, engaging in espionage, and communication with an enemy.***Special Update:On Dec. 19, 2011, it was announced that North Korea's mercurial and autocratic leader, Kim Jong-il, had died. Blamed for keeping North Koreans on the brink of starvation, the nation on the edge of economic collapse, and the global community in a state of anxiety over the country's nuclear program, Kim Jong- il was believed to have suffered a stroke in 2008. Since then, his health was regarded to be in a state of decline.Known as ""Dear Leader"" to the North Korean people, the rule of Kim Jong- il can well be viewed as one of the remaining ""cults of personality"" in the modern world.Attention quickly turned to who would fill the power chasm. To that end, the known ""great successor"" to stand at the helm of the country was Kim Jong- un -- the son of Kim Jong-il, whom had been promoted to the rank of general in the Korean People's Army more than a year earlier.At home in North Korea, citizens were urged to hold steadfast in their loyalty to Kim Jong-un.  As reported by the New York Times, North Korean television broadcast images of the country's senior military leaders saluting Kim Jong-un  as he received mourners at a mausoleum, where the body of Kim Jong-il laid in state.  The particular imagery was ostensibly intended to show that Kim Jong-un had gained the allegiance of North Korea's powerful military. Ultimately, Kim Jong-un would have to consolidate his power both symbolically and practically, or he could be relegated to a figurehead role at the helm of a ruling  military cadre.  But speculation on that score came to a close at the end of the year when  Kim Jong-un was offically named supreme commander of the country's armed forces. That particular appointment was made in accordance with provisions set forth in Kim Jong-il's will.As the world community wondered about the effects of Kim Jong-il's death on the matter of international security, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported that North Korea test-fired a missile off its eastern coast; South Korean officials apparently believed the missile launch was unrelated to the news ofKim Jong- il's death, although there was no official statement from South Korea's defense ministry.That being said, South Korea wasted no time placing its armed forces on high alert and the country itself was placed on a crisis footing. Likewise, the government of Japan held an emergency security meeting and expressed hopes that the news of Kim Jong- il's death would not have an ""adverse effect on peace and stability on the peninsula."" The Chinese government expressed distress and ""deep condolences"" over the news, and reaffirmed Beijing's close ties with Pyongyang. From Russia, the foreign ministry said it did not expect changes in bilateral relationship with North Korea. Across the Pacific in the United States, President Barack Obama reportedly discussed the situation with South Korean President Lee Myung-bak and promised that its commitment to stability on the Korean Peninsula remained intact. A statement from the White House read as follows: ""We remain committed to stability on the Korean peninsula, and to the freedom and security of our allies.""Ironically, news of Kim Jong-il's death came only days after a bilateral deal was forged between the United States and North Korea to exchange 240,000 tons of food from the United States for North Korea's pledge to move towards denuclearization . The agreement was brokered during talks in China between Robert King, United States special envoy on North Korean human rights, and Ri Kun, director general for North American affairs at North Korea's Foreign Ministry, and was intended to set the tone for forthcoming multilateral nuclear negotiations. Six-party talks -- involving North Korea, South Korea, Japan, China, Russia, and the United States -- have stalled since late 2008.According to South Korea's Yonhap news agency, Washington and Pyongyang ""reached the agreement based on North Korea's pledge to implement initial measures of denuclearization that include a suspension of its uranium-enrichment program."" North Korea, which has been plagued by chronic food shortages, would soon received shipments of food aid, including biscuits and nutritional supplements for infants, rather than rice, which was requested by the North Koreans. United States officials have apparently been concerned that rice would be given to the country's military rather than used to alleviate the dire circumstances of the North Korean general populace.There was some speculation about the late Kim Jong-il's involvement in forging this agreement, given the timing of the death announcement. If Kim Jong-il's health was devolving to the extent that he had died from ""great mental and physical strain,"" then was it possible for him to be involved in such significant negotiations?Such speculation was only heightened when, on Dec. 20, 2011, South Korean authorities began to express skepticism about the public details pertaining to the death of Kim Jong-il during a field guidance tour. Indeed, the leader of South Korea's intelligence service said he had doubts about the time and location of the North Korean leader's death. National Intelligence Service head, Won Sei-hoon, reportedly told the members of a parliamentary committee that the very train Kim Jong-il used for travel -- and which was supposedly the venue of the North Korean leader's death -- was identified at Pyongyang's train station. As reported by the Korean Herald, Won Sei-hoon noted, ""There were no signs the train ever moved."" Certainly, if the train was not used for any travel, it was not possible that Kim Jong- il could have died aboard it while participating in the aforementioned field guidance tour, as officially declared by the North Korean authorities.The quasi-mystery surrounding the actual details of Kim Jong-il's death aside, North Korea was concentrating its efforts on shoring up the image of Kim Jong-un as the undisputed new leader of the secretive communist nation. As reported by the New York Times, North Korean television broadcast images of the country's senior military leaders saluting Kim Jong-un as he received mourners at a mausoleum, where the body of Kim Jong-il laid in state. The particular imagery was ostensibly intended to show that Kim Jong-un had gained the allegiance of North Korea's powerful military. Meanwhile, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported that Kim Jong-un had carried out one of his first measures of supreme power by ordering all North Korean troops to cancel their field exercises and return to their barracks.His military influence notwithstanding, Kim Jong-un had yet to assume leadership as the general secretary of North Korea's Workers' Party -- the political power base of the country. Since 2010, Kim Jung-un held the position of vice chairman of the Central Military Commission of the ruling party.Ultimately, Kim Jong-un would have to consolidate his power both symbolically and practically, or he could be relegated to a figurehead role at the helm of a ruling military cadre. But speculation on that score came to a close at the end of the year when Kim Jong-un was offically named supreme commander of the country's armed forces. That particular appointment was made in accordance with provisions set forth in Kim Jong-il's will.It was yet to be seen how Kim Jong-un would relate to international powers, who were themselves anxious to see North Korea would move substantially in the direction of denuclearization at a time of sensitive geopolitical tensions across the globe. Following the funeral for the late Kim Jong-il on Dec. 28, 2011, state media in North Korea delivered a message from the powerful National Defense Commission of that country making ot clear that there would be no change in foreign policy orientation from Pyongyang in the post Kim Jong-il era. The statement read as follows: ""We declare solemnly and confidently that the foolish politicians around the world, including the puppet group in South Korea, should not expect any change from us."" Indeed, during the memorial funeral service for Kim Jong-il, the North Korean head of state, Kim Yong-name made it clear that the country -- now under new leadership -- intended to ""march firmly along the path of Songun taught by great leader Kim Jong-il."" The term ""Songun"" refers to North Korea's ""military first"" policy. Clearly, the military imperatives of North Korea would prevail even in the post Kim Jong-il era.On Feb. 29, 2012, North Korea formalized its ""denuclearization for food"" agreement with the United States. The terms of the bilateral deal included the exchange of 240,000 tons of food from the United States for North Korea's pledge to move towards denuclearization. The agreement included provisions for a North Korean moratorium on nuclear tests, long-range missile launches and uranium enrichment at its Yongbyon nuclear center, and acceptance of United Nations inspectors who would monitor the implementation of the terms. North Korea's acquiescence on this matter raised the possibility of ending the diplomatic impasse, which had allowed its nuclear program to continue for years without international oversight.Of course it should be noted that the agreement was not a new one; in fact it first came to light in the days prior to the news of the death of former North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il late in 2011. The agreement was brokered in December 2011 during talks in China between Robert King, United States special envoy on North Korean human rights, and Ri Kun, director general for North American affairs at North Korea's Foreign Ministry.At the time, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported that Washington and Pyongyang ""reached the agreement based on North Korea's pledge to implement initial measures of denuclearization that include a suspension of its uranium-enrichment program"" in exchange for much-needed food. North Korea, which has been plagued by chronic food shortages, would soon received shipments of food aid, including biscuits and nutritional supplements for infants, rather than rice, which was requested by the North Koreans. United States officials have apparently been concerned that rice would be given to the country's military rather than used to alleviate the dire circumstances of the North Korean general populace.The agreement was intended to set the tone for forthcoming multilateral nuclear negotiations. Six-party talks -- involving North Korea, South Korea, Japan, China, Russia, and the United States -- have stalled since late 2008.For its part, the United States welcomed the North Koreans' movement on the breakthrough deal, deeming it ""important, if limited."" The United States Department of State spokeswoman, Victoria Nuland, took a cautiously optimistic saying, ""The United States still has profound concerns regarding North Korean behavior across a wide range of areas, but today's announcement reflects important, if limited, progress in addressing some of these.""Striking a similar tone, the director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Yukiya Amano, characterized the announcement ""an important step forward."" He continued, ""Pending further details, we stand ready to return to Yongbyon to undertake monitoring activities upon request and with the agreement of the agency's board of governors.""In the aftermath of a ""denuclearization for food"" agreement with the United States, there were high hopes that the deal would facilitate progress in multilateral negotiations on North Korea's nuclear program. Those high hopes were somewhat dashed by news that North Korea intended to launch a satellite into orbit.Pyongyang announced on March 16, 2011, that it would launch an ""earth observation"" satellite, or the Kwangmyongsong-3, using a long-range rocket. The event was intended to mark the 100th birthday of its late leader Kim Il-Sung. Of course, such a move would be contrary to the prevailing United Nations resolutions, which prohibits North Korea's use of long-range intercontinental ballistic missile technology, as well as the aforementioned ""denuclearization for food"" agreement, the latter of which requires North Korea to adhere to a moratorium on nuclear tests and long-range missile launches.Not surprisingly, all the other countries involved in multilateral negotiations -- South Korea, Japan, China, Russia, and the United States -- expressed dismay over this plan by North Korea. United States Department of State spokesperson, Nuland, pointed to this concurrence and urged North Korea to rethink the satellite launch saying, ""Obviously, we were heartened that every single one of the six-party talks participants made clear that they think that this would be an extremely bad idea and a violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions, so we are hoping and expecting that the DPRK will take that to heart."" The United States also noted it would be ""very hard"" to go forward with its planned food assistance if North Korea moved ahead with the plan to launch a satellite into orbit.The geopolitical complexity of the Korean peninsula became more complicated on March 21, 2012, when the White House in the United States announced that President Barack Obama intended to visit to the world's most heavily militarized border -- the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). The White House explained that the trip to the DMZ was intended to convey the president's support for the 30,000 United States troops stationed in South Korea, and to augment bilateral relations between Washington and Seoul. In a press briefing, Daniel Russel, Asia director for the White House National Security Council, said: ""The DMZ is the front line of democracy in the Korean Peninsula, and it's the symbol of the U.S. and [South Korean] resolve, as well as solidarity. So a visit by the president there to see and to thank the U.S. and the South Korean service members makes perfect sense.""After his visit to the DMZ, President Obama was set to attend a global summit aimed at reducing the risk of nuclear terrorism in the South Korean capital of Seoul. Ahead of the Nuclear Security Summit, President Obama reiterated his call for ""a world without nuclear weapons"" and advanced his foreign policy agenda that advocates non-proliferation and the reduction of nuclear weapons through increase diplomacy.In a speech to students at South Korea's Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, President Obama said the United States -- the only nation to have ever used nuclear weapons -- was fully committed to reducing its stockpile of nuclear arms. The United States leader said his country had a ""moral obligation"" to pursue strategic arms cuts. President Obama also drew thunderous applause from the audience of students when he said that, as a father, he did not wish to see his daughters growing up in a world with nuclear threats.""I say this as president of the only nation ever to use nuclear weapons,"" Obama said. ""I say it as a commander in chief who knows that our nuclear codes are never far from my side. Most of all, I say it as a father, who wants my two young daughters to grow up in a world where everything they know and love can't be instantly wiped out.""President Obama acknowledged his country's unique position in the world, but he noted that ""serious sustained global effort"" was needed to achieve his expressed hope for a nuclear weapons-free world.The issue of nuclear proliferation has been at the forefront of the international purview given the ongoing concerns about North Korea's nuclear arsenal. Addressing the matter of North Korea's nuclear ambitions, President Obama made it clear that the United States held ""no hostile intent"" to that country, but warned that there would be ""no rewards for provocation.""The United States president said: ""The United States has no hostile intent toward your country...We are committed to peace. And we are prepared to take steps to improve relations, which is why we have offered nutritional aid to North Korean mothers and children."" President Obama continued, ""But by now it should be clear, your provocations and pursuit of nuclear weapons have not achieved the security you seek -- they have undermined it. Instead of the dignity you desire, you're more isolated. Instead of earning the respect of the world, you've been met with strong sanctions and condemnation. You can continue down the road you are on, but we know where that leads. It leads to more of the same -- more broken dreams, more isolation, ever more distance between the people of North Korea and the dignity and the opportunity that they deserve.""President Obama reiterated the warning already issued by his government that the long-range missile launch to place a satellite in orbit would only result in isolation for Pyongyang.He said,  ""With respect to North Korea, we are going to be both sending messages to North Korea that they should not go forward with this missile launch, which would violate existing U.N. Security Council resolutions. And our hope is, is that we can resolve these issues diplomatically.""President Obama also joined South Korean President Lee Myung-bak in noting that North Korea would be subject to further sanctions if it did not cancel its launch plans. Making clear the options available for North Korea, President Obama addressed the leadership of that country saying, ""You can continue with the road you are on but we know where that leads...Today, we say: Pyongyang, have the courage to pursue peace.""For his part,  Kim Jong Un -- North Korea's new leader -- appeared to be following his father's footsteps in the realm of rhetoric as he deemed the  nuclear summit to be  ""a childish farce.""  Earlier, Pyongyang asserted that  denunciations of North Korea  would amount to a ""declaration of war.""Pyongyang was also signaling that it had no intention of pulling back from its missile launch to sent a satellite into orbit. Instead,  South Korean sources were reporting that North Korea  moved a long-range rocket to a launch pad close to the Chinese border.  As well, satellite imagery appeared to depict preparations for the launch, which Pyongyang had said would take place between April 12-16, 2012.  The guidance was that the rocket would follow a  trajectory that would take it close to south-western Japan.Accordingly, Japan's defense ministry made it clear that it had ordered the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) to intercept North Korea's rocket launch, if necessary, using its missile shield.  Japanese authorities also alerted rescue personnel that they would be mobilized to deal with potential disasters, should the  veer off course. Already, the South Korean government had said that it would  shoot down any North Korean rocket that strayed into its territory. As well, the United States was sea-based X-band radar into the Pacific to monitor the launch. Upset about the prospect of rocket debris affecting countries of the Pacific, President Benigno Aquino III of the Philippines called on Pyongyang to abandon the launch plans.It should be noted that the Obama administration in the United States canceled its food aid program to North Korea due to that country's decision to move forward with the satellite launch.  An official from the Pentagon was cited as saying: ""Why we're not providing that food assistance at this point is because our confidence in their ability to meet their agreements has been diminished. We do not use it as a lever to change their policies.""A week ahead of the timeline expected for the North Korean missile launch, President Kim Jong Un warned that any country dared to interfere with its plans  would face ""immediate, resolute and merciless punishment.""  In a statement published by  the Korean Central News Agency, the North Korean leader asserted: ""(Any country that) intercepts the satellite or collects its debris will meet immediate, resolute and merciless punishment.""  Pyongyang also warned South Korea against intercepting the rocket booster, should it stray into South Korean territorial waters.  Pyongyang promised that an interception by Seoul would bring about ""the end of everything in South Korea.""On April 10, 2012, the United States was reiterating its warnings to North Korea that the launch of a new missile would be ""a clear and serious violation"" of international agreements.  White House press secretary Jay Carney said in an interview with journalists: ""The proposed missile launch, if conducted, would represent a clear and serious violation of North Korea's obligations under two United Nations Security Council resolutions that explicitly prohibit North Korea from testing ballistic missiles.""By April 13, 2012, news emerged from North Korea that although that country attempted to launch its satellite into space, the long-range rocket failed to reach orbit.  Despite the spectacular failure of the mission, the attempted action was nonetheless widely condemned by the international community.  Notably, members of the Group of Eight industrial nation states issued a joint condemnation, noting that the launch was in clear violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions prohibiting intercontinental missile deployments.In a related development, South Korean officials were noting that new satellite imagery suggests that North Korea was preparing to carry out a nuclear test. The imagery depicted piles of earth and sand at the entrance of a tunnel at a nuclear site, where previous nuclear bomb testing was carried out in 2006 and 2009.  An anonymous source was quoted by Agence France Presse as saying: ""Recent satellite images led us to conclude the North has been secretly digging a new underground tunnel in the nuclear test site... besides two others where the previous tests were conducted.""  Given the aforementioned launch failure, there were some suggestions that North Korea might try to ""save face"" by moving forward with an even more provocative act -- quite possibly, a nuclear test.  Of course, such an act would be regarded as a clear move down the path of confrontation by North Korea's regional neighbors as well as Western powers.By the third week of April 2012, presumably as a cautionary move, South Korea  announced that it had deployed missiles with a range of 625 miles. The weapons would be able to strike nuclear targets inside North Korea.As April 2012 entered its final week, North Korea was ratcheting up the militaristic rhetoric as it threatened to  initiate military action against South Korean targets and characterized South Korean President Lee Myung-bak a ""traitor"" and ""scum."" In a statement, Pyongyang issued the following threat: ""The special actions of our revolutionary armed forces will start soon to meet the reckless challenge of the group of traitors.  Once the … special actions kick off, they will reduce all the rat-like groups and the bases for provocations to ashes in 3 or 4 minutes ... by unprecedented peculiar means and methods of our own style.""Meanwhile, reports suggested that North Korea was close to completing preparations for a  nuclear test. This move -- if successful -- would constitute North Korea's third nuclear test after two in 2006 and 2009. The global community was watching events unfold in North Korea closely as  Pyongyang may now have the capacity to conduct a test using highly enriched uranium for the very first time.  This development would presage North Korea's possible ability to  significantly build up its stocks of weapons-grade nuclear material.  As well, it would facilitate the manufacture of a nuclear warhead to mount on a long-range missile.  Should North Korea go forward with its third nuclear test, it would be a clear example of the limits of China's influence on the paranoid  regime ruling North Korea today.At the start of December 2012, North Korea announced plans to carry out a new satellite launch.  A failed attempt to launch an ""earth observation"" satellite ensued in April 2012 when the long-range rocket crashed into the sea after traveling only a short distance.Now, in December 2012, North Korea was planning to launch a second version of Kwangmyongsong-3 (called the Unha-3) into space from the Sohae Space Center in  North Phyongan Province. The official North Korean state news agency said the satellite launch was set to occur roughly between Dec. 10, 2012, and Dec. 22, 2012.The United States issued a warning that the long-range missile launch to place a satellite in orbit  would threaten global peace and security, and  only result in isolation for Pyongyang. The United States also noted, as it did in April 2012, that such a move would be contrary to the prevailing United Nations resolutions, which prohibits North Korea's use of long-range intercontinental ballistic missile technology.  In a written statement, United States Department of State spokesperson Victoria Nuland declared:  ""A North Korean 'satellite' launch would be a highly provocative act that threatens peace and security in the region...Any North Korean launch using ballistic missile technology is in direct violation of UN Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs) 1718 and 1874.""  Nuland also noted that her country would be consulting with key partner countries, such as South Korea, Japan, China, and Russia, to discuss further steps in regards to these proposed moves by North Korea.By Dec. 7. 2012, there were more signs that the rocket launch plan was going forward as fuel-injection work  was reported to be taking place, according to South Korean media. Days earlier on Dec. 4, 2012, North Korea confirmed its plans to go forward with the rocket launch as it conveyed plans to the International Maritime Organization -- the United Nations' shipping agency.  Typically, such notification to the International Maritime Organization in such instances. Further details about the launch were released including the news that the three-stage rocket was expected to fly on a southward path and would drop into the sea off the west coast of South Korea, ultimately  landing in waters to the east of the Philippines. Since the flight path would take the rocket close to Japan's Okinawa island, the government of Japan was  positioning missile defense interceptors in order to be prepared  for the rocket charting off course.  It should be noted that this long-range rocket has sufficient range to reach the western part of the United States.On Dec. 9, 2012, North Korean authorities announced that the rocket launch -- due to take place between Dec. 10, 2012 and Dec. 22, 2012 -- was being delayed due to technical difficulties.  However, by Dec. 11, 2012, those technical difficulties were apparently resolved as international news media outlets reported that North Korea had fired its long-range Unha-3 rocket rocket from its west coast. According to the South Korean Yonhap News Agency, some debris from the rocket fell into waters off the Philippines after passing over the Japanese city of Okinawa, consistent with the expected trajectory.The firing of the rocket was supposedly  intended to launch a satellite into space.  North Korea announced that its goal had been achieved and a satellite was placed in orbit.The North Korean state news agency claimed success in its goal, declaring: ""The launch of the second version of our Kwangmyongsong-3 [Unha-3] satellite from the Sohae Space Centre... on December 12 was successful. The satellite has entered the orbit as planned.""It should be noted that while United States officials confirmed there was an object launched into orbit, it also noted that the object appeared to be wobbling off course.  South Korean defense sources had a somewhat different view and suggested that the satellite  was not necessarily  wobbling off course or out of control.  The South Koreans said that the satellite may have been intended to be in a circular orbit but was instead an elliptical orbit.There were also some questions about the level of success achieved in this exercise by the North Koreans.  Some experts, such as Vassily Mikheev of Russia's Institute for World Economy and International Relations, have pointed to the fact that North Korean engineers used old technology to launch the satellite into orbit. Mikheev noted that Scud technology  was intended for small missiles, and therefore  not particularly reliable  for firing a three-phased operation.Of course, the conventional wisdom was that the entire exercise was a pretense, and intended to demonstrate North Korea's technological capacity to deliver a nuclear warhead on a intercontinental ballistic missile.Regardless of actual motivation, the move by North Korea was made in defiance of international warnings that Pyongyang refrain from such provocative activity, and certainly in clear violation of prevailing United Nations Security Council resolutions.  Accordingly, the United Nations Security Council wasted no time in condemning North Korea for its actions, and making note that the launch was""a clear violation of Security Council resolutions.""  China -- North Korea's closest ally -- expressed ""regret"" over North Korea's decision to fire the rocket while calling for restraint on the part of the international community in response.  But  the United States was already  warning that Pyongyang would face consequences for its ""highly provocative act that threatens regional security.""  There were suggestions that a new resolution by the United Nations Security Council was in the offing, but with China's position on such a measure unknown.Meanwhile, all expectations were that North Korea was likely going to carry out a nuclear test. In 2009, following a rocket launch that year, North Korea carried out its second ever nuclear test. North Korea's first nuclear test was carried out in 2006. Two rounds of sanctions were imposed on North Korea in response to those provocative actions. Now, with another rocket launch accomplished, it was anticipated that North Korea would again follow that path and carry out a third nuclear test. Of course, it should be noted that North Korea was pursuing expensive nuclear development and rocket delivery technology even as most of its population lived in a state of abject poverty. Thus, the notion of further economic sanctions was unlikely to deter the paranoid and reclusive regime, which has long privileged its military agenda ahead of domestic concerns.***Special Report:2013 Special Report:

North Korea -- a threat to global security?

Summary:       On Feb. 12, 2013, North Korea carried out its third nuclear test, earning the wide and vociferous condemnation of the international community.  North Korea cast the test as a restrained response and warned of further actions in the face of ""U.S. hostility.""  The nuclear test was not unexpected, coming on the heels of a rocket launch in December 2012, which led to the United Nations'  early 2013 decision to tighten sanctions against North Korea.  North Korea under its new leader, Kim-Jong-un, has increased the anxiety of the international community by intensifying its rhetoric and threatening even more provocative actions.       In the face of such provocation, the United Nations Security Council  convened an emergency meeting to consider measures against North Korea -- a country that has, to date, been undeterred by international action or prevailing international law.  Indeed, the very existence of sanctions has not stopped North Korea from repeatedly violating the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.  North Korea's lack of concern for international opinion was displayed in high relief in mid-February 2013 when the state-controlled newspaper declared the country's need for intercontinental ballistic missiles.  Anxieties over global security reached new heights as news reports began to emerge about Iran playing a role in North Korea's nuclear development program.       In March 2013,  the United Nations Security Council acted against North Korea by  unanimously adopting Resolution 2094, which censured North Korea for its February 2013 nuclear test and imposing an even stricter sanctions regime on that country. At that time, tensions were increasing on the Korean peninsular, with North Korea using sharp rhetoric to issue threats against South Korea, even ending its armistice with the South that brought an end to the hostilities between the two Koreas, and ultimately declaring it was in ""a state of war"" with South Korea.  North Korea also cut off its emergency hotline with South Korea; by April 2013, North Korea  decided to re-open its nuclear complex at Yongbyon  and ceased border crossing access for South Koreans into the jointly-administered Kaesong industrial zone, which has often been viewed as a symbol of cross-border cooperation. North Korea, meanwhile, declared its enmity with the United States, warning that strikes on American interests might be in the offing, and pointing to United States military interests in Japan and Guam, presumably indicated they might be on Pyongyang's target list.  The North Korean military additionally claimed to have ""ratified"" a possible attack on the United States.       But by May 2013, the political climate appeared to have cooled and North Korea withdrew  two intermediate range missiles it had placed earlier on its east coast.  Nevertheless,  North Korea went onto to carry out four short range missile tests in mid-May 2013.  It was not known if North Korea was trying to re-ignite geo-political tensions or if the tests were routine exercises intended to simply show military might.  A month later in June 2013, there was a bizarre mix of progress and retreat on the diplomatic front as the two Koreas  planned and then cancelled bilateral negotiations; however, North Korea then proposed direct talks with the United States.       In August  2013 through September 2013, the two Koreas finally agreed to re-open operations at the jointly-administered Kaesong industrial zone. But in the second week of September 2013, signs pointed to the fact that operations were being restarted at North Korea's Yongbyon reactor.  It seemed that regardless of calming of tensions, North Korea was going forward with the threat made in April 2013 about re-opening its Yongbyon facility.       Background:       On Jan. 22, 2013,  the United Nations Security Council unanimously approved a resolution authorizing tighter sanctions against North Korea over its December 2012 rocket launch, which  at the time spurred international condemnation.   North Korea angrily responded  to the move by promising further rocket launches and nuclear testing, and also warning of retribution against the United States, which it described as a ""sworn enemy.""  The following statement was issued via the official Korean Central News Agency: ""We do not hide that a variety of satellites and long-range rockets will be launched and a nuclear test of higher level will be carried out in the upcoming new phase of the anti-U.S. struggle, targeting against the U.S., the sworn enemy of the Korean people.""  Pyongyang soon expanded its threats to note that it would take action against South Korea if it participated in the United Nations sanctions regime.  China's  official Xinhua News Agency also reported that Pyongyang intended to walk away from multilateral six-part talks since ""the U.N. Security Council has been reduced into an organization bereft of impartiality and balance.""       North Korea has not been a stranger to strong rhetoric, and since the December 2012 rocket launch, all expectations were that North Korea would follow its previous pattern of behavior and carry out a nuclear test.  To that end, South Korea's Yonhap News referenced  South Korean intelligence sources in reporting that North Korea had completed technical preparations for a nuclear test.  Thus, the nuclear test and belligerent threats against the United States  and South Korea were, in many senses, not surprising reactions from North Korea.  The decision to brand the United Nations Security Council an impartial entity and walk away from multilateral talks was perhaps the more unexpected path taken by Pyongyang, since China -- North Korea's closest ally -- is a veto-wielding member of that body.       But  by the end of January 2013, North Korea took its rhetoric to another level when it promised action at an even ""higher level"" than a nuclear test.  The position of the North Korean leadership was reported in the Rodong Sinmun state newspaper as follows:  ""It is the people's demand that we should do something, not just a nuclear test, but something even greater. The U.N. Security Council has left us no room for choice.""       This bellicose language continued in February 2013 when  Pyongyang again threatened ""stronger measures""  than simply a third nuclear test in response to ""hostile"" sanctions by the international community.  A statement by North Korea's state news agency read as follows: ""The DPRK (Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea, or North Korea) has drawn a final conclusion that it will have to take a measure stronger than a nuclear test to cope with the hostile forces nuclear war moves that have become ever more undisguised.""  There was no indication as to what form those ""stronger measures"" might entail although there was some suggestion that North Korea might use enriched weapons grade uranium, rather than plutonium,  in an explosion of some sort.       The use of uranium  could indicate North Korea's intent to expand its nuclear arsenal through uranium enrichment.   It would also incur a high level of risk.  As noted by  Siegfried Hecker, former director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico  and a professor at Stanford University in California, in  Foreign Policy magazine: ""If a next test is well contained, then we may learn nothing about the device. However, one of the risks Pyongyang takes in trying to demonstrate a test at a higher level is that they may produce fissures that allow radioactive seepage or possibly cause a major blowout from the tunnel.""       North Korea's bellicose language was matched with provocative visual imagery.  At issue was the release of a  three-minute video on YouTube depicting a North Korean man's dream sequence in which the city of New York is destroyed, with the 1985 song ""We are the world"" playing in the background.   A caption, which was translated from Korean in The Guardian newspaper, reads as follows: ""Somewhere in the United States, black clouds of smoke are billowing.  It seems that the nest of wickedness is ablaze with the fire started by itself.""   It continues:  ""Despite attempts by imperialists to isolate and crush us … never will anyone be able to stop the people marching towards a final victory."" The video was reported to have been released by  North Korea's state-run media and while of amateur quality in some regards, it nonetheless represented a sharp threat against the United States and/or the interests of its allies.       Two dates that North Korea might be considering for a nuclear test were Feb. 16, 2013, the birthday of former leader, Kim Jong-il, or Feb. 25, 2013, the inauguration date of Park Geun-hye of South Korea.       North Korea's third nuclear test       On Feb. 12, 2013, seismic activity in North Korea suggested that officials may have selected an even earlier date to go forward with a third nuclear test.  The seismic shock activity emanated from the same area where North Korea had conducted its 2006 and 2009 nuclear tests. Kim Min-seok of the South Korean Defense Ministry indicated that country's belief, saying, ""We believe that North Korea has conducted a nuclear test.""  Meanwhile, the United States Geological Survey indirectly confirmed that the test had taken place as it noted the shock appeared to be one kilometer underground and was consistent with a nuclear blast.  According to Lassina Zerbo, the director of the international data center of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test Ban Treaty Organization, the magnitude of the test was twice as large as the 2009 nuclear test.  It should be noted that initial reports suggested the use of  plutonium in this nuclear test, which tends to be suited for use as a missile warhead.       North Korea itself soon confirmed that it had carried out  its third underground nuclear test, which it said involved a ""miniaturized"" nuclear device. As reported in a statement by the state-run  KCNA news agency: ""It was confirmed that the nuclear test that was carried out at a high level in a safe and perfect manner using a miniaturized and lighter nuclear device with greater explosive force than previously did not pose any negative impact on the surrounding ecological environment.""       North Korea claimed its third nuclear test  was an act of self-defense against ""U.S. hostility"" and warned that further  moves might be in the offing.  Via the state-controlled KCNA news agency, Pyongyang claimed  that the nuclear test  ""was only the first response"" taken ""with maximum restraint.""  Pyongyang warned that further actions were in the offing, saying: ""If the United States continues to come out with hostility and complicates the situation, we will be forced to take stronger, second and third responses in consecutive steps.""       International Response       The chorus of condemnation from the international community was broad and vociferous. United Nations  Secretary General Ban Ki-moon wasted no time in condemning North Korea's nuclear test, which he emphasized was a ""clear and grave violation"" of United Nations resolutions. NATO cast the nuclear test as an ""irresponsible act"" that posed a serious threat to world peace.  Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov demanded that North Korea  abandon its nuclear program and return to the negotiating table. China, North Korea's closest ally, demanded an audience with the North Korean ambassador in Beijing, while Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi said China was ""strongly dissatisfied and resolutely opposed"" to the nuclear test.   Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe declared the nuclear test to be a ""grave threat"" and vowed that it could not be tolerated.  In a statement, United States President Barack Obama argued for a swift response, asserting: ""The danger posed by North Korea's threatening activities warrants further swift and credible action by the international community. The United States will also continue to take steps necessary to defend ourselves and our allies.""  But perhaps the most scathing response came from Denmark's  Foreign Minister Villy Sovndal, who said: ""This [nuclear test] deserves only one thing and that is a one-sided condemnation.  North Korea is likely the most horrible country on this planet.""       The United Nations Security Council convened an emergency meeting later on Feb. 12, 2013 to discuss future measures. During that meeting, the permanent and rotating member nations of the United Nations Security Council  unanimously condemned North Korea's latest nuclear test and warned that ""appropriate measures"" would be in the offing.       Clearly, North Korea would be faced with the prospects of international action.  Even its closest ally, China, via its state-controlled media, had urged North Korea not to go forward with such a provocative action  and warned that North Korea would pay a ""heavy price""  if it proceeded with the test.  Of course, in the realm of international jurisprudence, heavy costs have come in the form of harsh sanctions by the United Nations Security Council, which have done little to curtail North Korea from going forward with its missile  program and nuclear development agenda.  Indeed, the very existence of sanctions has not stopped North Korea from repeatedly violating the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.       Belligerence and Brinkmanship       North Korea's lack of concern for international opinion was displayed in high relief when the state-controlled newspaper declared the country's need for intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).  Only two days after carrying out  its third nuclear test, North Korea displayed its brazen stance by declaring that it should own ICBMs since the  ""imperialists""  -- an apparent reference to the United States -- had a nuclear arsenal. According to a review in Rodong Sinmun, North Korea's main newspaper and an apparent mouthpiece for the North Korean government --  the country required ICBMs to augment its self-defense.  The article in Rodong Sinmun also declared that North Korea would be a formidable enemy in the face of adversity or any challenge, and warned that there ""can be no compromise in the last fight to herald the victory for independence for humanity.""  The diatribe also included the promise to  ""strike a blow to end imperialism.""       The North Koreans' efforts to develop  ICBM capacity were apparently  not being undertaken in isolation. According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, there  were suggestions that the Iranians might be assisting the North Koreans with the development of a rocket program.  Blog 38  at Johns Hopkins University noted that its analysis of satellite imagery taken in early 2013 showed that  preparations were being made for an impending test of a liquid-fueled rocket.  That satellite imagery  further showed that North Korea could conceivably test rockets larger than the size of the rocket deployed in late 2012 from a new launch pad.  As stated in the report published in Blog 38: ""Analysis of construction activities around the new launch pad has revealed evidence that Pyongyang's rocket program may be receiving assistance from Iran.""       Since Iran was already ensconced its its own controversial nuclear development program -- to the great consternation of the international community -- the news of a possible connection between Pyongyang and Tehran was being  met with alarm across the world.  Indeed, there was a growing sense of anxiety about global security as a result.  That being said, the general consensus was that North Korea had not, to date,  developed the ability to deploy a nuclear warhead on an ICBM.       In the last week of February 2013, researchers at Johns Hopkins University -- via  Blog 38 -- said that satellite imagery of the nuclear test facility show possible signs of human activity there, even after the third nuclear test.  They suggested that North Korea might be preparing for a fourth nuclear test.  As stated in Blog 38: ""It remains unclear whether renewed activity at the site is normal for the days after a nuclear detonation or if it is an indication of Pyongyang's intention to conduct another test in the near future.""  Sources from the Chinese government suggested that Pyongyang was waiting for possible action from the United Nations Security Council  before it makes a decision on   a fourth nuclear test.       Consequences       With news circulating in the first week of March 2013  that a draft  of a United Nations Security Council resolution against North Korea had been crafted, Pyongyang wasted little time in registering its anger.  On March 5, 2013, North Korea warned that it would end its 1953 armistice (ceasefire) that brought a conclusion to the conflict with South Korea, without officially ending the Korean War.  North Korea also demanded that the United States and South Korea end its ongoing military drills in the region, referring to them as a ""dangerous nuclear war targeted at us.""  Furthermore, the Korean People's Army warned that it would carry out stronger actions  in response to the ""hostile"" policies of the United States and South Korea. It was apparent that North Korea was prepared to take an aggressive stance in the face of international pressure.       On March 7, 2013, the United Nations Security Council unanimous adopted Resolution 2094 censuring North Korea for its February  nuclear test and imposing an even stricter sanctions regime on that country.   Included in those new sanctions were provisions to target the financing sources of North Korea's nuclear and missile technology, but there were additional penalties imposed on North Korea in the realm of banking, travel, transportation,  and trade.       As stated by United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Susan Rice, ""The strength, breadth and severity of these sanctions will raise the cost to North Korea of its illicit nuclear program. Taken together, these sanctions will bite and bite hard.""  South Korea's Ambassador to the United Nations, Kim Sook, said the time had come for North Korea to ""wake up from its delusion"" of becoming a nuclear state. He continued, ""It can either take the right path toward a bright future and prosperity, or it can take a bad road toward further and deeper isolation and eventual self-destruction.""  Meanwhile,  United Nations  Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the unanimous adoption of the resolution delivered a strong message to North Korea that its pursuit of nuclear weapons would not be tolerated by the international community.       In  addition to scrapping its non-aggression agreements with South Korea, North Korea responded to the news of international action by saying that it would be  cutting off the North-South hot-line. Installed in 1971, the hot-line was created to provide direct communication at  times of increased tensions and also to organize the transfer of persons and goods through the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone.  Clearly, the disabling of the hot-line was not only symbolic of the breakdown in bilateral relations between the two Koreas, there were also practical and security implications.       It should be noted that North Korea has also shockingly threatened to  launch pre-emptive nuclear attacks on the United States and South Korea in response to the joint military drills, which it said were proof of the United States' intent to go to war.  A belligerent North Korea said via its Foreign Ministry that the United Nations' action would ""compel"" that country to take ""countermeasures"" in short order.    Furthermore, it declared in a statement: ""Now that the U.S. is set to light a fuse for a nuclear war, the revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK will exercise the right to a pre-emptive nuclear attack to destroy the strongholds of the aggressors and to defend the supreme interests of the country."" North Korea even threatened to transform   Washington and Seoul into ""a sea in flames"" with ""lighter and smaller nukes.""       For its part, South Korea was undeterred and moving forward with the very joint military drills (with the United States) that earned outrage and threats from Pyongyang. Still, South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se said on March 11, 2013, that his country would try to re-engage with North Korea with an eye on shifting the climate from tension and threats to cooperation. In an address, Yun said his goal was to ""turn this era of confrontation and mistrust into an era of trust and cooperation with North Korea.""  Yun further asserted: ""The security situation on the Korean Peninsula for now is very grave as the unpredictability surrounding North Korea is rising following its third nuclear test.""       Escalating Tensions       As March 2013 was drawing to a close, North Korea increased its belligerent rhetoric and said that missile and artillery units were combat-ready and aimed at United States and South Korean targets.  In a statement broadcast on the  state-controlled Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), the Korean People's Army's Supreme Command said: ""From this moment, the Supreme Command puts all of its field artillery including strategic rocket units and long-range artillery units into the No. 1 combat ready  posture.""  The statement further delineated targets in South Korea and the United States -- from its military installations in the Pacific to Hawaii and the mainland.  Indeed, a North Korean spokesperson was on the record saying, ""The U.S. should not forget that the Anderson Air Force Base on Guam, where B-52s take off, and naval bases in Japan proper and Okinawa, where nuclear-powered submarines are launched, are within the striking range of [North Korea's] precision strike means.""  North Korea said that its motivation was driven by the priority ""to safeguard our sovereignty and the highest dignity [of leader Kim Jong Un] through military actions.""       The United States responded with its own statement as follows: ""North Korea's bellicose rhetoric and threats follow a pattern designed to raise tensions and intimidate others. While the United Nations Command, Combined Forces Command and U.S. Forces Korea continue to maintain the armistice, North Korea continues its provocative behavior and rhetoric. The Republic of Korea-U.S. alliance is strong and we remain committed to the defense of [South Korea].""       Then, on March 30, 2013, North Korea declared it was in a ""state of war"" with South Korea and that its the long-standing truce with the South had ended.  A statement from Pyongyang read as follows: ""From this time on, the North-South relations will be entering the state of war and all issues raised between the North and South will be handled accordingly. The long-standing situation of the Korean peninsula being neither at peace nor at war is finally over.""   In response, the South Korean defense ministry denounced the war threat and issued its own statement, which read as follows: ""Our military is maintaining full preparedness to leave no blind point in safeguarding the lives and safety of the people.""  As well, South Korean President Park Geun-hye noted that her country was taking the  threats from North Korea ""very seriously.""  She said, ""If there is any provocation against South Korea and its people, there should be a strong response in initial combat without any political considerations.""       For its part, the United States military command in South Korea dispatched a statement that read as follows:  ""North Korea will achieve nothing by threats or provocations, which will only further isolate North Korea and undermine international efforts to ensure peace and stability in Northeast Asia.""       Matching its words  with concrete illustrations, the United States was also displaying its military versatility by deploying B-2 and B-52 planes with nuclear capabilities over South Korea, while also flying F-22 Raptor fighter jets from Japan to South Korea's Osan Air base. As well, as noted below, the United States said it would deploy additional ballistic-missile interceptors along the country's Pacific Coast, with an eye on protecting the United States from a potential attack from North Korea.  As well, the United States  moved its  sea-based  X-Band radar platform, normally based in Hawaii, closer to the North Korean coast, with the intent of monitoring  potential attempts from North Korea to launch a long-range missile.  By April 2013, the United States  additionally decided to deploy an anti-missile system to Guam.       Tensions on the Korean Peninsular escalated on April 2, 2013 when  the state-controlled Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) of the North Korea announced that it would be re-opening its main nuclear complex at Yongbyon and restarting its nuclear reactor there.       The Yongbyon complex was home to both a uranium enrichment facility and a nuclear reactor; it  was closed as a part of a 2007 agreement between North Korea and a multilateral cadre, including China and the United States.  The agreement mandated the closure of the reactor at Yongbyon  in lieu of one million metric tons of heavy fuel oil as well as humanitarian aid benefits.   The agreement was only really in effect for a couple of years since  North Korea resumed the reprocessing of  fuel rods stored at the site in 2009, complaining that it did not receive the desired level of energy assistance.       This 2013 decision to open the Yongbyon complex and restart operations of the nuclear reactor was illustrative of  the intensification of dissonance on the Korean peninsular ongoing since late 2012.  But it was also a disturbing development as it showed that the new leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un, was prepared to take increasingly provocative actions.  As a result, the international community was now regarding the paranoid and alienated nation state of nuclearized North Korea through the valence of anxiety.       Reflecting this sentiment, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he was ""deeply dismayed"" by North Korea's decision to re-open the main nuclear complex at Yongbyon and restart the nuclear reactor.  He further condemned the provocative actions declaring: ""The current crisis has already gone too far. Nuclear threats are not a game. Aggressive rhetoric and military posturing only result in counter-actions, and fuel fear and instability.""       Secretary General Ban urged all partied to engage in urgent talks as  ""the only way to resolve the current crisis."" However, with North Korea cutting off its military hot-line with South Korea, canceling its armistice with that country,  using the rhetoric of war, and re-opening its Yongbyon facility, it seemed that authorities in Pyongyang were not in the mood for productive diplomatic engagement.       Indeed, a day later on April 3, 2013,  North Korea has ceased border crossing access for South Koreans into the jointly-administered Kaesong industrial zone. Since Kaesong has been viewed as a tacit symbol of the state of geopolitical relations and the last significant arena of cooperation between the two Koreas, the cessation of cross-border access at the industrial zone was regarded as a disturbing development.       By April 4, 2013, the state-controlled Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said the military had ""ratified"" an attack on United States interests.  The KCNA statement further noted that North Korean troops had been authorized to counteract American aggression with ""powerful practical military counteractions,"" including nuclear weapons, and involving ""cutting-edge smaller, lighter, and diversified nuclear strike means.""  The KCNA statement included the following warning: ""The moment of explosion is approaching fast. No one can say a war will break out in Korea or not and whether it will break out today or tomorrow.""  The expressed nuclear threat was the most blatant and belligerent exposition from the North Korean regime on global stability in recent memory.  Raising the  threat to another level, Pyongyang also told foreign embassies that it could not guarantee their safety in the event of conflict.       In a speech to the National Defense University in Washington, United States Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel noted that the recent actions of the North Koreans ""present a real and clear danger.""  Meanwhile, Russian  foreign ministry spokesperson, Alexander Lukashevich, observed that North Korea's actions may very well foreclose the notion of multilateral negotiations .  He cast Pyongyang's attempts to violate decisions of the United Nations Security Council"" as  ""categorically unacceptable,"" and issued the following warning: ""This radically complicates, if it doesn't in practice shut off, the prospects for resuming six-party talks.""       On April 5, 2013, Western officials were confirming reports that North Korea had moved a medium-range missile, known as a Musudan or Nodong B, to its east coast. It was unknown if the move was to be interpreted as a threatening gesture , with a warhead mounted on the missile, or part of the preparations for test firing.  There was growing suspicion  that North Korea might, in fact, be preparing to carry out yet another missile test. It should be noted that while this Musudan/Nodong B missile has a range of around 3,000 kilometers (1,875 miles), which would put all of South Korea, Japan, and possibly the United States' territory of Guam in its range; however, there was no test history to ensure precision. As noted by  Greg Thielmann, a senior fellow at the Arms Control Association,  ""A missile that has never even had a flight test is not an operational system and is not a credible threat."" Of course,  a missile launch might be in the offing for the purpose of acquiring that test history.       By April 10, 2013, South Korean sources said that North Korea appeared to be preparing to launch the Musudan mid-range ballistic missile that had been moved to the east coast, and warned that North Korea might even be preparing the fire the Musudan simultaneously with shorter range Nodong and Scud missiles.  The missiles launch could conceivably coincide with the celebration of the birthday of Kim Il-sung, the country's founder.       Meanwhile, the rhetoric from North Korea continued to be bellicose with North Korean state media asserting that the scenario on the  Korean Peninsula situation was ""inching close to a thermonuclear war,""  and authorities in Pyongyang warning foreign nationals in  South Korea to evacuate from that country.  The Obama administration in the United States, via White House spokesperson, Jay Carney, characterized North Korea's statements as ""unhelpful.""  Carney continued, ""This kind of rhetoric will only further isolate North Korea from the international community and we continue to urge the North Korean leadership to heed President Obama's call to choose the path of peace and to come into compliance with its international obligations.""       It should be noted that the foreign ministers of the so-called G-8 countries -- the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy,  Canada, Japan, and Russia -- have condemned North Korea's recent actions, and warned of consequences in North Korea conducts either a missile launch or a nuclear test.  On April 12, 2013, United States Secretary of State John Kerry traveled to South Korea and accentuated this multilateral warning, saying ""If Kim Jong-Un decides to launch a missile, whether it is across the Sea of Japan or some other direction, he will be choosing willfully to ignore the entire international community.""       A day later, Secretary of State Kerry  met with Chinese leaders to find ways to end the geopolitical crisis brewing on the Korean peninsular.  Following that meeting, Secretary Kerry said that the United States and China were both calling for North Korea to refrain from further provocative actions. It was clear that the international community was united in its stance against North Korea's recent acts of dangerous provocation.       Secretary of State John Kerry ended his Asian trip with a call for negotiations to end the dissonance and emphasizing the imperative of finding  a diplomatic solution. He said, ""The United States remains open to authentic and credible negotiations on denuclearization, but the burden is on Pyongyang. North Korea must take meaningful steps to show that it will honor commitments it has already made, and it has to observe laws and the norms of international behavior.""       Meanwhile, with an eye on decreasing the tensions between the two Koreas, South Korean President Park Geun-hye called for peaceful dialogue.  But North  Korea was quick to reject the overture, characterizing the offer of talks as a  ""cunning ploy.""  If that response was any indication, North Korea remained defiant in the face of international pressure.       Latest Developments       April 15, 2013 -- the  anniversary of North Korea's founder's birth -- passed fairly quietly, without a continuation of the bellicose war threats and even free of a huge military parade showcasing North Korean military might.  The hopes that North Korea might be digesting the call for talks, and that the heated geopolitical climate had cooled for the moment, dissipated as Pyongyang issued new threats of war.  A statement via state-controlled media was issued as follows: ""Our retaliatory action will start without any notice from now.""       It should be noted that South Korea  responded to the recent actions of North Korea by deploying two warships with  the Aegis missile defense systems on the east and west coasts.  As well, Japan deployed missile defense systems around Tokyo to defend against any missile threat by North Korea.       In an interview with NBC News broadcast on April 16, 2013, United States President Barack Obama said that while the intelligence available does not suggest that North Korea has the ability to successfully arm a ballistic missile with nuclear warheads, he yet believed his country needed to be prepared for all possibilities.  He said,  ""Based on our current intelligence assessments we do not think that they have that capacity. But we have to make sure that we are dealing with every contingency out there.  That's why I repositioned missile defense systems: to guard against any miscalculation on their part.""       Asked whether he believed the  North Korean leader, Kim Jung-Un, was mentally unstable, President Obama responded, ""I'm not a psychiatrist. And I don't know the leader of North Korea.""   However, President Obama characterized  North Korea's exposition of bellicose and vituperative war rhetoric as being similar to a childish tantrum, and unlikely to yield productive results.  He said, ""You don't get to bang your spoon on the table and somehow you get your way.""       President Obama seemed cognizant of the fact that the impasse was unlikely to end easily, although he did not foreclose the possibility of a diplomatic resolution.  He mused, ""All of us would anticipate that North Korea will probably make more provocative moves over the next several weeks... This is the same kind of pattern that we saw his father engage in, and his grandfather before that. If they want to rejoin the community of nations, that path is available to them.""       On April 18, 2013, North Korea's National Defense Commission issued a statement via the official Korean Central News Agency, demanding that the United States and South Korea withdraw ""all nuclear war making capabilities from the region,"" with an eye on future dialogue.  North Korea also called for  Washington and Seoul to apologize for its  aggression.       In response, a spokesperson for the  White House, Josh Earnest,  said that the Obama administration was committed to denuclearization of the Korean peninsular and was open to ""authentic and credible negotiations.""  Earnest noted that the  actions and rhetoric from North Korea ""actually indicate the opposite.""  He added, ""We also need to see some clear evidence that the North Koreans themselves are willing to live up to their international obligations, are willing to demonstrate their commitment to ending the nuclear program, something they've promised in the past.""       By April 21, 2013, North Korea was reported to have moved  two short-range missile launchers to the east coast.  According to a South Korean military source in a report by the South Korean Yonhap news agency, satellite imagery showed the transfer of  two mobile missile launchers suitable for short-range Scud missiles to the South Hamgyeong province.  Earlier in the month, as noted above, two mid-range Musudan missiles were  place on launchers on the east coast.  Collectively, these actions indicated that a missile launch might be in the offing -- possibly to mark the  anniversary of the founding of the North Korean military on April 25.  However, that date passed without any show of force.       In the last week of April 2013, South Korea called on North Korea to engage in  dialogue over the Kaesong industrial complex, which became a flashpoint in the ongoing crisis between the two Koreas.  Regarded as a symbol of cooperation between North Korea and South Korea, the decision by the North to block access to the jointly-run industrial complex was interpreted as a clear sign of deteriorating relations, devolving diplomacy,  and the slide towards confrontation.  That slide became more precipitous when  North Korea outright rejected the invitation to engage in  talks.  South Korea, therefore, responded by withdrawing its nationals from the  Kaesong industrial zone in the interests of safety.       On May 6, 2013,  CBS News reported that the two Musudan medium-range missiles, which had been moved to the east coast of North Korea weeks prior, were now removed from the launch site. Those missiles, as discussed above,  had sufficient range to reach Japan as well as the United States territory of Guam in the Pacific.       The movement of the missiles was being interpreted in some circles as a cooling of the heated tensions on the Korean Peninsular. Of course, with the start of the spring farming season, it was also possible that many members of the army were -- as they do each year --  necessarily turning their attention to the planting effort.       Regardless of the rationale, the removal of the Musudan missiles from the launch site conceivably indicated that the threat posed by North Korea was reduced at this time, if only on a temporary basis.  Indeed, since the Musudan is a mobile missile, it could well be transported back to the launch site in short order.  As noted by a senior United States official from the National Security Council in an interview with BBC News, it was ""premature to celebrate it as good news,"" given North Korea's record of unpredictable behavior to date. Striking a similar tone, George Little, a Pentagon spokesperson,  characterized North Korea's most recent stance as ""a provocation pause.""       May 2013 saw North Korea carry out a series of short-range missile tests from its east coast.  As global leaders attempted to bring down the level of tensions on the Korean Peninsular,  and even after North Korea pulled back its two medium range missiles from its launch pad, the firing of four -- albeit short range -- missiles was being regarded as a provocation.  It was not known if North Korea was trying to re-ignite geo-political tensions or if the tests were routine exercises intended to simply show military might. Regardless, United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon  urged North Korea to refrain from carrying out any further missile tests and ""resume dialogue.""       Presumably in an effort to show that the United States was fully prepared to defend itself from the potential nuclear missile threat posed by North Korea or any other belligerent nation state, the Missile Defense Agency along with the United States Navy on May 16, 2013  completed a successful test of a missile defense system as it destroyed a target launched in the Pacific Ocean.  According to reports from the  Department of Defense, a short-range ballistic missile target was launched  from the Pacific Missile Range Facility on the Hawaiian island of Kauai;  the USS Lake Erie was able to  detect and track the missile, then launch a blocking missile with a kinetic warhead, which successfully destroyed the target.  United States officials said the test operation in Hawaii demonstrated that the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense system was fully functional.       Negotiations Planned and Canceled       On June 6, 2013, North Korea proposed convening talks with South Korea over the jointly-administered Kaesong industrial zone, which had been shut down months earlier amidst heightened tensions.  The proposal  also included a provision to restart tours at the Mount Kumgang resort, which was suspended when a South Korea tourist was shot by a North Korean guard in 2008.       In regards to the more recent closure of the industrial complex,  more than 50,000 North Korean workers at Kaesong were withdrawn and South Koreans and supplies were banned entry as part of North Korea's illustration that it was in a ""state of war"" with South Korea.  As intimated above in the ""Background"" note, the Kaesong complex has often been viewed as a symbol of cross-border cooperation between the two Koreas and its closure augured negatively as regards the overall geo-political security on the Korean Peninsular. But with North Korea's Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea offering the overture of dialogue on Kaeosong and Mount Kumgang,  it was believed that an effort was being made to de-escalate tensions and move to a more constructive footing.       North Korea's Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea issued the following statement outlining its proposal of dialogue: ""We propose holding talks between authorities of the North and South for the normalization of operations at Kaesong and the resumption of tours to Mount Kumgang on the occasion of the anniversary of the June 15 joint declaration.""  South Korea's Ministry of Unification, which administers inter-Korean affairs, said the government in Seoul was ""considering the proposal in a positive light."" Earlier, South Korea made it clear that given the precipitous and dangerous decline in bilateral relations during the first part of 2013, it would not only consider government level engagement with North Korea.       One day later on June 7, 2013, South Korea accepted North Korea's offer of bilateral talks but insisted that rather than have them take place in the  North Korean border town of Kaesong, that the dialogue site be in the  truce village of Panmunjom in the demilitarized zone between the countries.  South Korea also  noted that it was interested in taking up a range of issues, including the Kaesong Industrial Complex, the tourist center at Mount Kumgang, and the notion of family reunions.  The North reacted to South Korea's stance in a rare show of cordiality  asserting the following via a statement: ""We appreciate the fact that the South side promptly and positively responded to the proposal made by us for holding talks between the authorities of both sides.""       It should be noted that the North Korean government in Pyongyang also said that if Seoul accepted its proposal, it would also re-establish the emergency hotline channels, which were severed earlier in the year, as noted above.       But optimism about diplomatic progress between the two Koreas plummeted on June 11, 2013, when despite the fact that preliminary talks on technical and administrative details were reported to have gone smoothly.  By June 13, 2013, more details emerged related to the cancellation of the negotiations.  The cause was attributed to the composition of the respective delegations at the negotiating table in the first ministerial level talks since 2007.       Originally, South Korean Unification Minister Ryoo Kihl-jae was slated to lead South Korea's delegation.  When South Korea requested that North Korea send Kim Yang-gon, an adviser to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un,  to the talks, North Korea declined.  Seoul then decided to dispatch  Vice-Unification Minister Kim Nam-shik to lead its delegation instead.  North Korea took offense to the apparent ""downgraded"" level of South Korean officials present  at the talks  and decided to withdraw completely.  North Korea placed the blame on South Korea for ""arrogant obstruction"" and ""deliberate disturbance"" resulting in the aborted negotiations.  North Korea further characterized South Korea's decision to change the composition of its delegation in this manner as ""the height of discourtesy and disrespect unprecedented in the history of the North-South dialogue"".       For its part, South Korea  said it was disappointed with North Korea's response.  South Korea also made it clear that  it would not be offering to participate in negotiations with North Korea at any point in the near future.  As noted by South Korean Prime Minister Chung Hong-won: ""In the past, we have made infinite concessions to the North, but the time has come to hold talks where both sides are represented by officials of the same level.""       At the start of July 2013, relations between the two Koreas seemed to be moving in a more productive direction when North Korea agreed to hold talks on the Kaesong industrial complex, only hours after South Korea suggested  the meeting.  It was hoped that this overture would end more positively than the situation in June 2013 when the proposed Kaesong discussions were halted over procedural disagreements, as discussed just above.  However, as of mid-July 2013, there was no immediate agreement reached on resuming operations at their joint Kaesong industrial complex.       With relations between the two Koreas at a stalemate of sorts in mid-June 2013 (subsequently improved in early July 2013, as discussed above), it came as something of a surprise when North Korea proposed direct talks with the United States.  North Korea's  National Defense Commission, headed by North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un, said it hoped for ""serious discussions... to secure peace and stability.""  The United States responded to this overture by saying it looked towards  ""credible negotiations,"" made clear that North Korea had to be compliant with United Nations resolutions and travel down the path of denuclearization.   At the start of July 2013, North Korea renewed its push for engagement with the United States when Choi Myung-nam, an international affairs director at the North Korean Foreign Ministry, said Washington should take Pyongyang's diplomatic offers seriously. It should be noted that while representatives of the United States and North Korea have held meetings sporadically, the two sides have not  engaged in high-level talks since 2009.       Meanwhile, in the third week of June 2013, North Korea was apparently building on its sudden appetite for diplomatic engagement as it expressed an interest in restarting international nuclear negotiations.  According to  China's foreign ministry, North Korean officials were now indicating that they wanted to ""peacefully resolve the nuclear issue.""  It should be noted that multilateral talks between North Korea, South Korea, China, Japan, Russia, and the United States over North Korea's controversial nuclear program collapsed in 2008.  North Korea's renewed interest in diplomatic engagement at the multilateral level came as a result of high-level strategic talks with Chinese officials in Beijing. It was to be seen if an actual return to the multilateral negotiating table was in the offing.       In mid-August 2013,  the two Koreas were  able to successfully reach an agreement to re-open the jointly-administered Kaesong industrial complex.  The accord between the two countries included a provision ensuring that Pyongyang would never again shut the industrial complex -- often viewed as a symbol of cross-border cooperation --  ""under any circumstances.""  Another key provision of the accord was the move to  ""internationalize"" the Kaesong industrial complex by hosting foreign visitors at the factory park. This element would effectively make it harder for  North Korea to take any unilateral action involving the facility.  Left unspecified at the time was a precise date for the reopening of the facility and the resumption of regular operations.       By September 2013  the two Koreas agreed on a ""trial"" start date of Sept. 16, 2013.  It should be noted that agreement was also forged in regard to exempting South Korean firms from taxes for the rest of 2013  to offset losses incurred during the period of months when the complex was closed.  Agreement was also made to facilitate easier access to the complex for South Koreans carrying out commercial responsibilities, and for the purpose of attracting foreign investors to the Kaesong Industrial Complex.       Nuclear site activity --       In mid-2013, despite the overtures of diplomatic engagement to the United States, and a stated interest in returning to multilateral talks, satellite imagery depicting a North Korean test site indicated possible preparations for a possible test of a nuclear device in the future.  Researchers at John Hopkins University's North Korean Blog 38 Forum reported that satellite imagery of the Punggye-ri nuclear test site showed that some construction was being carried out the site where  North Korea conducted nuclear tests in 2009 and 2013. Researchers at John Hopkins University said: ""This activity appears to have begun by late April 2013 and gathered momentum over the next few months.""  While there was no conclusive sense of what the increased activity at the Punggye-ri nuclear test site really meant, the researchers suggested that the construction could simply be a matter of repairs, or preparations for a future test.  As stated in the Blog 37: ""These activities do not appear to be part of preparations for a nuclear test in the near-term. Rather, they seem to be long-term projects ... that may be necessary for the conduct of future tests.""       In September 2013,  signs pointed to the fact that operations were being restarted at North Korea's Yongbyon reactor.  Of note was the fact that white steam was seen rising from the Yongbyon nuclear facility.  According to the Blog 38 North website of the United States-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University, the color and volume of the steam signaled that the reactor was getting close to being operational.  The blog entry read as follows: ""The white coloration and volume are consistent with steam being vented because the electrical generating system is about to come online, indicating that the reactor is in or nearing operation,"" said the Washington-based institute.""  It seemed that regardless of calming of tensions, North Korea was going forward with the threat made in April 2013 about re-opening its Yongbyon facility.       As stated by Jeffrey Lewis of Blog 38 in an interview with BBC News, ""The reactor looks like it either is or will within a matter of days be fully operational, and as soon as that happens, it will start producing plutonium."" He continued, ""They really are putting themselves in a position to increase the amount of material they have for nuclear weapons, which I think gives them a little bit of leverage in negotiations, and adds a sense of urgency on our part.""   Still, that sense of urgency was a relative one with the Institution for Science and International Security issuing a report in which it would yet take time before North Korea could use new plutonium in nuclear weapons.  The institute's report issued the following finding: ""Given that North Korea will likely need two-three years before it discharges irradiated fuel containing plutonium and another six to 12 months to separate the plutonium, there remains time to negotiate a shutdown of the reactor before North Korea can use any of this new plutonium in nuclear weapons.""       Note:  See below for  information on North Korea's nuclear capability and the United States' capability to respond to the threat posed by North Korea to its national security.       ***       Special Report:       North Korean ship carrying Cuban weapons intercepted by Panamanian authorities       An international imbroglio was in the making in mid-July 2013 when a North Korean ship carrying Cuban weapons was intercepted by Panamanian authorities. According to  Panamanian President Ricardo Martinelli, the ship was targeted by drug enforcement officials as it  traveled from Cuba and approached the Panama Canal. Of concern to the Panamanian authorities was the fact that the ship disappeared from satellite tracking systems after it left the Caribbean side of the Panama Canal. This situation raised the suspicions of Panamanian authorities who wondered why the ship's crew would de-activate the tracking system that conveys details of the vessel's location.       As stated by Panamanian President Ricardo Martinelli, ""We had suspected this ship, which was coming from Cuba and headed to North Korea, might have drugs aboard so it was brought into port for search and inspection."" When the vessel, Chong Chon Gang, was taken into port and subject to search and inspection, its  cargo of suspected missiles was uncovered. Of note was the fact that the weapons were discovered amidst a shipment of sugar.       The drama in the Panama Canal reached new heights, according to Panamanian President Martinelli, when the North Korean ship captain had a heart attack and tried to commit suicide, while a riot involving the ship's crew of 35 ensued.  The entire crew was subsequently taken into custody while the vessel and its shipments were seized. As well, President  Martinelli posted an image via his Twitter account depicting a large green object inside a cargo container, which he characterized as the suspected ""sophisticated missile equipment.""        Soon after the fracas unfolded, Cuba admitted that this stash of weapons was included in its shipment of 10,000 tonnes of sugar to North Korea.  Cuba explained that the weapons were obsolete Soviet-era arms from Cuba  being sent for repair in North Korea.  That explanation was plausible since North Korea possesses some expertise in the weapons arena. However, Panama called on the United Nations to lead an inquiry into the weapons materials to determine precisely what was stashed in the shipment.       Under the aegis of prevailing  United Nations sanctions, the transportation of all weapons to or from North Korea is prohibited.  Moreover, even a benign matter such as the transportation of weapons for repair to North Korea  would, nonetheless,  require a waiver from the United Nations Security Council.  It would seem that no such waiver was procured by Cuba or North Korea.       As well, regulations pertaining to the transfer of shipments through the Panama Canal required the declaration of military cargo, including  so-called ""obsolete"" weapons. Thus, an investigation into the matter was  underway, while the North Korean crew was faced with the prospect of charges of illegal weapons smuggling in Panama. As noted by President Martinelli, ""The world needs to sit up and take note: you cannot go around shipping undeclared weapons of war through the Panama Canal.""       It should be noted that North Korea issued a demand that its ship be returned and the crew of the Chong Chon Gang be released.  Panama was not acquiescing to this demand and, instead, was moving forward with the aforementioned investigation.       By the close of July 2013, woes for Cuba and North Korea over the infamous ship carrying weapons cargo only increased.  At issue was the report by Panamanian authorities that four new undeclared containers were found aboard the  Chong Chon Gang, quite likely in  violation of United Nations sanctions.  That determination, however, was yet to be made.       In February 2014 ,  Panama had released the  Chong Chon Gang and the  ship's owner was forced to pay a fine totalling almost $700,000 for violating navigation regulations (specifically those attending to the transporation of weapons).  As well,  three crew members were facing weapons trafficking charges, although the charges against the other 32 crew members were dropped.        At issue for the Panamanian government was the fact that the weapons  being smuggled were not ""obsolete defensive weapons"" as claimed by Cuba, but in fact several sophisticated weapons in perfect condition.  Indeed, it was soon revealed that the stash of weapons included two MiG-21 aircraft, 15 MiG engines and nine anti-aircraft missiles.       A preliminary report  by a panel of experts to the Sanctions Committee at the United Nations Security Council concluded that the Chong Chon Gang  violated prevailing United Nations sanctions against North Korea, which ban the transfer of weapons to that country.   Yet to be determined would be the type of penalties the United Nations Security Council would levy against Cuba.        ***       Special Entry

Satellite photos indicate North Korea producing fuel rods for nuclear reactor at Yongbyon --      On Dec. 24, 2013, the United States-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University in Washington D.C. reported that satellite imagery indicated that North Korea was producing fuel rods for its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon.       Months earlier in September 2013,  amidst progress on the diplomatic front as the two Koreas agreed to re-open operations at the jointly-administered Kaesong industrial complex, there was retrenchment on the matter of North Korea's nuclear program.  There were indications that operations were being restarted at North Korea's Yongbyon reactor. Of note was the fact that white steam was seen rising from the Yongbyon nuclear facility.        According to the Blog 38 North website of the United States-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University, the color and volume of the steam signaled that the reactor was getting close to being operational.  The blog entry read as follows: ""The white coloration and volume are consistent with steam being vented because the electrical generating system is about to come online, indicating that the reactor is in or nearing operation,"" said the Washington-based institute.""  It seemed that regardless of calming of tensions, North Korea was going forward with the threat made in April 2013 about re-opening its Yongbyon facility.      As stated by Jeffrey Lewis of Blog 38 in an interview with BBC News in September 2013, ""The reactor looks like it either is or will within a matter of days be fully operational, and as soon as that happens, it will start producing plutonium."" He continued, ""They really are putting themselves in a position to increase the amount of material they have for nuclear weapons, which I think gives them a little bit of leverage in negotiations, and adds a sense of urgency on our part.""         Still, that sense of urgency was a relative one with the Institution for Science and International Security issuing a report in which it would yet take time before North Korea could use new plutonium in nuclear weapons.  The institute's report issued the following finding: ""Given that North Korea will likely need two-three years before it discharges irradiated fuel containing plutonium and another six to 12 months to separate the plutonium, there remains time to negotiate a shutdown of the reactor before North Korea can use any of this new plutonium in nuclear weapons.""      But as of late December 2013, clearly no ""shutdown"" of the reactor was in the immediate offing.  Instead, the United States-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University was  reporting that satellite imagery showed that North Korea was producing fuel rods for its Yongbyon nuclear reactor.  The United States-Korea Institute  further concluded that one building at Yonbyon had been renovated to produce fresh fuel rods for the reactor, which appeared to be operational.  As well, another building was identified which could be used to produce fuel for a light-water reactor.        Via the Blog 38 North website, the United States-Korea Institute offered the following  assessment: ""The identification of these facilities indicates a more wide-ranging, extensive effort by North Korea to modernize and restart the Yongbyon complex."" The institute continued, ""Based on this analysis, it appears the North Koreans anticipated that future requirement before 2009 and knew the lead times required to produce the necessary fresh fuel. Once international inspectors were expelled in 2009, they moved forward with the renovation of the main pilot plant building as part of what was likely their contingency plan for reactivation.""      The ""good news"" for neighboring countries anxious about a nuclear-armed North Korea was the belief that Pyongyang holds possession of only 25 percent of the fuel rods necessary for the reactor to reach full power.      ***      Special Entry:      North Korea and South Korea exchange fire following North Korean threat of another nuclear test      On Feb. 27, 2014, North Korea fired four short-range missiles over the sea off its eastern coast -- essentially to the north of the border with South Korea. The South Korea Yonhap News Agency speculated that the missiles were Scud short-range missiles with a  capacity of traversing 125 miles and thus capable of reaching targets in South Korea but not as far as Japan.

On March 2, 2014, North Korea fired another two short-range missiles into the sea off the eastern coast of the Korean peninsula.  The South Korea Yonhap news Agency reported that the missiles likely flew about 300 miles and were believed to be  Scud-C models -- this time capable of reaching targets in both South Korea and Japan.     In the third week of March 2014, North Korea fired  a series of 30 short-range rockets into the sea off the eastern end of the Korean peninsula. The rockets were thought to be Soviet-era FROG rockets that have been in North Korea's possession since the 1960s, and seemingly flew for more than 35 miles before landing in the sea.  This launch of the 30 FROG missiles came after other such missile tests in the weeks prior, as discussed above.     In the last week of March 2014, North Korea test fired two medium range Nodong missiles, which landed in the ocean between North Korea and Japan.  The action essentially triggered a condemnation from the United Nations Security Council, which noted that the missile launches were a violation of prevailing United Nations resolutions, such as  Security Council Resolutions 1718  and  1874 that prohibit North Korea from carrying out ballistic or nuclear activity.  The United Nations Security Council also warned  of an ""appropriate response"" to come.  Undeterred, North Korea lashed back at the United Nations Security Council, characterizing its condemnation as  ""absolutely intolerable"" and justifying its own action as being a ""self-defensive"" move.     There were suggestions that North Korea was reacting to the  annual joint military exercises by United States and South Korean forces, which Pyongyang typically characterizes as acts of war and aggression.  Fueling the fire for North Korea was the flight of a United States nuclear-capable B-52 bomber  over South Korea.  South Korean authorities have put forth the theory that North Korea's missile launched constituted an ""armed protest"" against the joint South Korean-United States military drills that were taking place.     Perhaps exasperated by North Korea's provocative acts and  saber rattling, which were manifest most recently by the missile launches, China had already entered the equation.  Even before the launch of the medium range missiles in the last week of March 2014,  China hard earlier  declared a ""red line,"" saying that it would not allow  war or chaos on  the Korean peninsula, and  asserting that peace was possible only  via  denuclearization. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi was on the record saying, ""The Korean peninsula is right on China's doorstep. We have a red line, that is, we will not allow war or instability on the Korean peninsula."" Wang demanded that  all parties  ""exercise restraint"" and noted that ""genuine and lasting peace"" on the Korean peninsula was only possible with denuclearization.  He said, ""Confrontation can only bring tension, and war can only cause disaster.""  The Chinese foreign minister also endorsed the resumption of multilateral nuclear talks, saying, ""Some dialogue is better than none, and better early than later.""     This stance by China -- North Korea's most  important diplomatic and economic supporter -- suggested that Beijing was no longer willing to accept Pyongyang's theatrics on its doorstep.   Pressure on North Korea had already begun to intensify a month earlier in February 2014 when the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, urged global powers  to refer North Korea to the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court following a report that documented horrific crimes against humanity in that country.   While China was unlikely to join the human rights chorus against North Korea, it certainly seemed prepared to use its influence to compel  North Korea to return to the nuclear negotiating table.  Adding to the suggestion that dialogue might be at hand, Japan and North Korea were scheduled to engage in their first high level talks in years.     However, the nuclear negotiating table appeared to be a distant notion as March 2014 came to a close, and as North Korea threatened to go forward with a nuclear test.  As reported by the North Korean Central News Agency, North Korea said it would not foreclose the possibility of testing a ""new form"" nuclear weapon in defiance of international condemnation and in contravention of prevailing international law. While Pyongyang did not specify the type of nuclear weaponry it intended to test, the conventional wisdom has long been  held that North Korea was attempting to develop small and sophisticated nuclear devices that could be delivered by intercontinental ballistic missiles.     South Korea warned that if its neighbor to the north went forward with a nuclear test, there would be consequences in the offing.  As noted by South Korea Foreign Ministry spokesman Cho Tae-young, ""North Korea should bear in mind that if it ignores the stern demand from the neighboring countries and the international community and carries out a nuclear test, it will have to pay a price for it.""     On March 31, 2014, tensions on the Korean peninsula exponentially increased as North Korea and South Korea exchanged fire across its western maritime border.     According to South Korean authorities, this exchange of fire was presaged by North Korea's announcement that it would hold ""live fire"" military drills along its border zone with South Korea.  South Korea warned that there would be immediate retaliation if any ordinance touched its jurisdiction.  North Korea then fired more than 500 artillery rounds, some 100 of which landed in South Korean territorial waters.  As promised,  the South Koreans responded by firing  more than 300 rounds into  North Korean waters and scrambling F-15s on its side of the maritime border.     Known as the Northern Limit Line, the maritime border has been a well known flashpoint region between the two Koreas, and its very existence is a matter of dispute from the point of view of the North Koreans. The boundary was established after the end of the Korean War in the 1950s by the United Nations, but the line of demarcation has been accepted by North Korea.   It should be noted that North Korean artillery fire killed four South Koreans on the Yeonpyeong border island in the same disputed area in 2010.  In another egregious incident in 2010, North Korea torpedoed a South Korean warship in the disputed border region, sinking the vessel and killing 46 people.  Now, in 2014, it was again the locus of dissonance between the two Koreas as a result of the North's decision to hold military drills in this hotspot region.     It was to be seen if these were actions by North Korea were aimed at improving Pyongyang's negotiating position for the future as it attempted to stave off further sanctions that were likely to come, or, if they were intended to be blatant and irrational acts of provocation.  South Korean Defence Ministry spokesperson,  Kim Min-seok, intimated that Pyongyang's actions were being motivated by both factors as he said, ""We believe the North's maritime firing is a planned provocation and an attempt to test our military's determination to defend the Northern Limit Line and to get an upper hand in South-North relations.""     *** Note:  See below for  information on North Korea's nuclear test history, nuclear capability, and the United States' reaction to the threat posed by North Korea to its national security. ***     ***     Special Entry     North Korea test fires missiles ahead of South Korean visit by Chinese president     On July 2, 2014, North Korea fired a series of short-range rockets into the sea off its east coast. While the type of rockets could not be confirmed by South Korean sources that reported the event, they surmised that they were likely 300 mm rockets. Days earlier, North Korea fired two short range ballistic missiles.  It should be noted that while the short range rocket launch were not in violation of prevailing United Nations Security Council resolutions against North Korea, the firing of short range  ballistic missiles were, indeed, in violation of international law.     The apparent display of military might by North Korea came ahead of a visit by  Chinese President Xi Jinping to South Korea.  It was not known if the test firing of missiles was intended to intimidate China, which is North Korea's only major ally and home to a own far more sophisticated military. But with China being pressured by South Korea and the West to use its influence to curb North Korea's provocative actions, and return to the negotiating table as regards its nuclear and missile program, it was possible that North Korea was delivering the message that it would not be swayed by its closest ally, especially when that ally's leader was on a formal visit to South Korea.  In truth, Chinese   President Xi Jinping  was returning the courtesy of a visit to China by South Korean President Park Geun-hye; however, it was not likely that paranoid Pyongyang would interpret the visit in the most benign manner.     North Korea fires three short-range rockets ahead of Pope Francis' visit to South Korea     In mid-August 2014, North Korea fired three short range rockets from the port city of Wonsan; the rockets landed in the sea off the east coast of the Korean peninsula.  The incident coincided with Pope Francis' arrival in South Korea for a five day visit and ahead of scheduled joint military exercises between South Korea and the United States.  North Korea objects to those drills, charging that they are intended to prepare for war.  As such, North Korea has typically taken some sort of provocative action to protest the joint military activity.  In this case, North Korea reacted with the firing of the rockets as well as the issuance of a statement that read as follows: ""Given that the U.S. and the puppet forces of South Korea continue staging nuclear war exercises against us in particular, we will take countermeasures for self-defense which will include missile launches, nuclear tests, and all other programs.""  It was to be seen if North Korea would indeed follow up the rocket launches with nuclear tests, as indicated.

*** Note:  See below for  information on North Korea's nuclear test history, nuclear capability, and the United States' reaction to the threat posed by North Korea to its national security. ***    ***    Special Note    United States slaps sanctions on North Korea in response to alleged cyber-attack on Sony    At the start of 2015, the United States imposed new sanctions on North Korea in response to an alleged cyber-attack on  Sony Pictures Entertainment.  Of note was the fact that United States sanctions against North Korea were already in place as a result of Pyongyang's provocative and dangerous nuclear program.  This new tranche of sanctions was being imposed as a retributive  measure promised by the Obama White House in response to a cyber-attack on Sony Pictures, which the United States government charged was carried out by agents of North Korea. While some cyber-experts have cast doubts on the claim that North Korea was behind the cyber-attack, the United States government has held steadfastly to that claim.     The cyber-attack on Sony Pictures began when the so-called Guardians of Peace hacked and released data from Sony's computers, exposing embarrassing electronic mail correspondence. The group soon took its attack to new heights, threatening theaters intending to screen Sony's satirical comedy, The Interview, which featured a humorous assassination plot against the leader of North Korea. Those threats caused Sony to cancel its cinema release of the movie, ultimately earning the rebuke of United States President Obama who suggested that decision by Sony was ""a mistake.""  To that end, Sony later reversed its decision and    released the film in some theaters and in online formats.    Meanwhile, North Korea's response to the hacking drama plaguing Sony was confusing.  Powers in that country at first praised the cyber-attack, casting it as a ""righteous deed,""  and even implying it might be the work of its own agents; later,  they denied culpability altogether.  However, as noted above, the United States made clear that it placed the blame for the Sony cyber-attack on North Korea, with Obama administration officials warning of  a ""proportional response"" in the offing.    By late 2014, there was speculation that a disruption or ""blackout"" of Internet service in North Korea may have been part of the package of consequences promised by the Obama administration against North Korea.  However, the United States government refused to acknowledge whether or not it was responsible for cutting off Internet connectivity in North Korea.     By contrast, at the start of 2015, the Treasury Department in the United States was utterly forthright  when it publicly named  three entities as well as 10 North Korean government officials in its  sanctions announcement.  The United States Treasury's list of targets included  individuals working in Iran, Syria, China, Russia and Namibia. The three entities covered by the sanctions were as follows: The Reconnaissance General Bureau -- North Korea's primary intelligence organization; the Korea Mining Development Trading Corporation (Komid) -- North Korea's primary arms dealer; and Korea Tangun Trading Corporation -- a defense research  agency.  It should be noted that the targets of the new sanctions were not necessarily linked to the cyber-hacking attack on Sony Pictures.  Instead, it appeared that the United States was simply augmenting its sanctions regime already in place against North Korea.  The intent was to isolate North Korea's defense industry as a deterrent against future cyber-attacks.    For his part, President Barack Obama signed an executive order on Jan. 2, 2015, officializing the sanctions, while the White House released a statement that read as follows:  ""We take seriously North Korea's attack that aimed to create destructive financial effects on a U.S. company and to threaten artists and other individuals with the goal of restricting their right to free expression. Today's actions are the first aspect of our response.""  The White House added,  ""This step reflects the ongoing commitment of the United States to hold North Korea accountable for its destabilizing, destructive and repressive actions, particularly its efforts to undermine U.S. cyber-security and intimidate U.S. businesses and artists exercising their right of freedom of speech.""    ***    Special Note    U.S. Ambassador to South Korea brutally attacked; North Korea calls the violence justified    In the first week of March 2015, United States Ambassador Mark Lippert was brutally attacked by a pro-North Korean activist in the South Korean capital of Seoul.     Ambassador Lippert, who was serving as the United States envoy to South Korea, was attending a breakfast aimed at a discussion of the reunification of the two Koreas. During the breakfast, the assailant pushed Lippert onto a table and slashed his face with a knife, seriously injuring him.  The ambassador was then rushed to the hospital and endured 80 stitches and several hours of surgery to close his facial wound. South Korean doctors later said that Lippert narrowly survived the injury.    The assailant was soon identified as as pro-North Korean activist,  Kim Ki-jong, who was known to authorities due to a previous attempt to attack Japanese Ambassador Toshinori Shigeie, for which he received only a suspended sentence. As well, there was a long record of Kim Ki-jong's participation in anti-American protests.   In South Korea, activists with pro-Pyongyang sensibilities are few in number; however, they hold passionate beliefs about the contribution of foreign powers to the divisions between the Koreas.       South Korean  President Park Guen-hye condemned what she cast as an ""attack on the South Korea-U.S. alliance.""  However, the incident did not reflect well on her, the South Korean government, or South Korean security authorities. Indeed, there were vital questions arising about (1) the level of security at the high-level breakfast, and (2) the fact that the assailant -- with his known history -- was not only free, but permitted to attend a diplomatic breakfast attended by high ranking officials.    Meanwhile, North Korea entered the fray, lauding the act of violence and characterizing it as ""just punishment for U.S. warmongers.""  On behalf of the United States, Secretary of State John Kerry asserted that his country  would not be ""intimidated or deterred by threats or by anybody who harms any American diplomats.""  For his part, Ambassador Lippert exhibited great resilience, writing after surgery via the social media outlet, Twitter,   ""Doing well and in great spirits... Will be back ASAP to advance US-ROK [Republic of Korea] alliance!""    ***

Special Note   Talks between two Koreas ends in agreement to de-escalate tensions after exchange of fire and North Korean move to ""war footing""   On Aug. 20, 2015, North Korea shelled across the border, prompting South Korea to retaliate with several rounds of artillery fire.   Reports indicated that North Korea carried out the initial burst of shelling in retaliation for anti-Pyongyang rhetoric that has been broadcast on loudspeakers from South Korea.  The broadcasts have generally be regarded as a type of psychological warfare against Pyongyang and intended to counteract the North's nationalist propaganda.   South Korea responded to North Korea's shelling, as noted here, by firing rounds of artillery.  North Korea did not immediately return fire, opting instead to warn South Korea to cease its broadcasts, which it viewed as a declaration of war, along the border area within 48 hours. North Korea warned that if South Korea did not heed its warning, it would take military action.  However, South Korean authorities said that the broadcasts would not be stopped, thus prompting the exchange of multiple rounds of fire -- none of which ended at this time with  any casualties.   The exchange of fire came after two South Korean soldiers died in a landmine blamed on  North Korea earlier in August 2015, and before annual joint military exercises between the United States and South Korea that North Korea regularly condemns as an act of aggression. As a result of these incidents and the impending joint military exercises, tensions were now markedly intensified between the two Koreas.  Given this unstable landscape,  South Korea moved to evacuate residents from   Yeoncheon in  the western sea  border. South Korea's National Security Council was also set to convene an emergency session.   Then, on Aug. 21, 2015,  in a disturbing escalation of tensions, the  North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, placed his country on ""war footing."" North Korean state media reported that after an emergency meeting of the central military commission, King Jong-un had ordered that North Korean troops be ""fully ready for any military operations at any time.""  While North Korea has often indulged in fiery militaristic rhetoric, this instance was regarded as more alarming since an exchange of fire had just taken place.   On Aug. 23, 2015, South Korean President Park Geun-hye released a statement in which she said that the anti-Pyongyang broadcasts would continue unless North Korea apologized for the landmine incident that killed two South Korean soldiers.  She said, ""We need a clear apology and measures to prevent a recurrence of these provocations and tense situations. Otherwise, this government will take appropriate steps and continue loudspeaker broadcasts.""  The program of cross-border broadcasts actually ended in 2004 but resumed in recent times as a result of North Korean aggression.  It was to be seen  how North Korea would respond to the South Korean leader's demand, and if  high level bilateral talks between the two sides -- presumably with an eye on decreasing tensions -- would yield productive results.    A day later on Aug. 24, 2015, following marathon negotiations between the two Koreas in the in the so-called  ""truce village"" of Panmunjom inside the demilitarized zone (DMZ), the two Koreas released a statement indicating they had reached an agreement to de-escalate tensions.  According to the statement, North Korea expressed ""regret"" over the deaths of two South Korean soldiers in the aforementioned landmine incident, stopping just short of taking responsibility for the loss of life.  North Korea also agreed to end its war footing, which had actually commenced in earnest.  For its part, South Korea agreed to end its cross-border loudspeaker broadcasts.  Also of note was the fact that North Korea and South Korea agreed to future  discussions on a range of issues, with an eye on diffusing tensions and improving bilateral ties.   The agreement could only be regarded as a positive development on the Korean peninsula, especially given the volatile personality of nuclear-armed North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un.  But Pyongyang officially applauded the agreement, with the state news agency noting that it had moved the  inter-Korean relations from a catastrophic path  on to ""the track of reconciliation and trust."" North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un, also lauded the accord between the two Koreas, calling it  ""a landmark occasion.""    On the other side of the border, South Korean President Park Geun-hye enjoyed a political boost from her handling of the North Korean crisis, according to survey data that showed a spike in her job  approval rating.   Of significance was the fact that the 1950-1953 war between the two Koreas ended with an armistice and not a peace treaty . As such, any escalation of tensions or movement to military action is generally regarded with gravity and alarm by countries of the region of eastern Asia.

***  Special Entry  New activity detected at North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear site; Pyongyang confirms resumption of nuclear operations and warns of attack on U.S. --  Only weeks after North Korea and South Korea reached an agreement to tamp down cross-border hostilities, evidence of activity at North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear site was emerging.  At issue in mid-September 2015 were reports from the Johns Hopkins University's 38 North Blog, which monitors North Korea, that concluded that there was fresh activity taking place at two areas of Yongbyon -- specifically, at the 5 MWe reactor hall  and at the  Radiochemical laboratory, both of which are central sites in the  production of plutonium needed for the manufacture of nuclear weapons.  Of note was satellite imagery  indicating increased movement of  vehicles  around the 5 MWe reactor hall, as evidenced by heavy tire tracks around the ground floor of the building.  The imagery depicted tracks leading to the spent-fuel receiving building where nuclear fuel enters the reprocessing facility, and others tracks around  the support building where trucks would unload their materials.  There was also imagery at the Radiochemical laboratory where plutonium is chemically separated from uranium and other radioactive materials, for the purpose of building nuclear weapons.  As would be expected, the kind of activity at the  5 MWe reactor hall  and at the  Radiochemical laboratory in Yongbyon raised alarm bells across the globe.  While it remained impossible to determine whether Pyongyang was producing plutonium and  no conclusion could be drawn regarding the reason for increased  activity in Yongbyon,  the information nonetheless left the international community concerned that North Korea was increasing its weapons building capacity.  There remained a remote possibility that the activity could be due to renovations or maintenance; there was also a possibility that North Korea was replacing  contaminated equipment from the 5 MWe reactor and transporting it to the reprocessing complex for decontamination. Nevertheless, the general consensus was that Pyongyang was, more than likely,  ramping up its nuclear production and further developing its stockpile of nuclear weapons.  As noted by Director General Yukiya Amano of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), ""These [activities] appear to be broadly consistent with the DPRK's statements that it is further developing its nuclear capabilities.""  On Sept. 15, 2015, Pyongyang removed all doubt about its nuclear activities, confirming that the Yongbyon nuclear site had indeed resumed operation.  The reactor at Yongbyon provided plutonium for North Korea's nuclear weapons program but was shut down in 2007.  In 2013, following North Korea's third nuclear test, the government in Pyongyang made clear that the reactor would be restarted.  Now, in 2015, it was apparent that Pyongyang was making good on that threat.   According to the state-run news agency, known by the acronym, KCNA, North Korea was aiming to increase its nuclear weapons arsenal and improve the quality of nuclear weapons in its possession.  With North Korea already in possession of approximately 12 atomic bombs, nuclear weapons experts surmise that now that the reactor at Yongbyan has resumed operations, the North could conceivably produce enough plutonium for one nuclear bomb each year.  Of significance, though was the fact that those bombs were unlikely to be small enough to be fit a nuclear warhead, although there were recent claims to the contrary by Pyongyang (as discussed directly below).  It should be noted that North Korea was not simply delivering the message that it was expanding its nuclear weapons stockpile.  North Korea was also making an explicit threat to use its nuclear bombs to attack enemy states; to that end, North Korea asserted that it would face hostility from the United States ""with nuclear weapons any time.""  That particular threat was to be understood along with North Korean claims that it had effectively manufactured a device small enough to fit a nuclear warhead  on a missile that presumably could be launched at the will of the leadership in  Pyongyang.   There remained, however,  skepticism regarding the North's actual progress in regard to miniaturization.    Distance is another key consideration.  As has been the case in the past, North Korea's threats to attack the United States was being interpreted in the context of the plausibility.  Could a North Korean missile actually reach American soil?  While a missile could certainly reach South Korea, there were question marks about it reaching a longer distance.  For example, the medium-range missile, known as a Musudan or Nodong B  has a range of around 3,000 kilometers (1,875 miles), which would put all of South Korea, Japan, and possibly the United States' territory of Guam in its range.  But since there was no  test history to ensure precision (an issue addressed below), such a threat had to be regarded with some skepticism.   As noted by  Greg Thielmann, a senior fellow at the Arms Control Association,  ""A missile that has never even had a flight test is not an operational system and is not a credible threat.""  With this fact in mind,  the successful launch of a missile was unlikely to transpire without testing of the type that would be discernible to the entire world.  While that knowledge should ideally calm immediate anxieties about global stability,  the news that  North Korea intended to launch a rocket to transport its Songun Korea satellite into space was being received with alarm.   Typically, North Korea's  space and satellite announcements  function as a ruse for its nuclear military activities.  Specifically, North Korean claims of satellites being launched into space have long been  interpreted as euphemisms for  long-range missile tests.   North Korea has in its possession the long-range Unha rocket, which was launched into space in 2012 but billed as a satellite.  All signs pointed to a repeat test of this type --  regardless of the fact that North Korea was prohibited from conducting ballistic missile technology tests under prevailing United Nations Security Council Resolutions.   Given North Korea's record of defiance in regard to international law, there was little chance that warnings would stop Pyongyang from going down the road of a long-range missile test.  To be determined was the matter of whether or not North Korea's rocket technology was sufficiently advanced as to be able to strike Hawaii or the western coast of the mainland United States.  With the  70th anniversary of the foundation of the ruling Workers Party in the offing, this collective news about North Korea's nuclear activity and ambitions sparked the anxiety of the world, which was now bracing for another provocative act by Pyongyang.  ***  Special Report:     North Korea underlines role as global security pariah with long range missile test on the heels of alleged hydrogen bomb test  In January 2016, North Korea claimed to have successfully carried out  its first underground test of a hydrogen bomb at its Punggye-ri nuclear site.  A significant 5.1 magnitude tremor was detected in the region, with monitors quickly noting that it was not caused by natural seismic activity.  Pyongyang soon released a statement via state media, which declared: ""The republic's first hydrogen bomb test has been successfully performed at 10:00 am on Jan. 6, 2016.""  North Korean state media went on to make claims about the development in strident propaganda-laced language, as  it added:  ""People of the DPRK are making a giant stride, performing eye-catching miracles and exploits day by day.""  It should be noted that a hydrogen bomb test would indicate a marked augmentation of North Korea's nuclear capabilities, were it to be confirmed.  However, nuclear experts quickly discounted North Korea's claim, pointing to the fact that the blast was not large enough to be an actual thermonuclear explosion.   In an interview with BBC News,  James Acton,  one of the directors of the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said of the blast, ""It tentatively appears too small to be a hydrogen bomb.""  Likewise, in an interview with international media, Bruce Bennett, a defense analyst with the Rand Corporation, made the following observation:  ""The bang they should have gotten would have been 10 times greater than what they're claiming.""  Bennet also noted that if a full thermonuclear device was utilized by North Korea, the blast should have generated a seismic measurement of ""around seven on the earthquake scale.""  The general consensus seemed to be that North Korea had not tested a  genuine thermonuclear device, but very  likely utilized modifications and tested a boosted fission device.  But North Korea had also claimed that its device was miniaturized.  It should be noted that there was little information available to either prove or disprove North Korea's miniaturization claims.  That aspect could potentially be alarming for the global community since a nuclear device needs to be small enough to be fitted onto a missile for delivery purposes (vis a vis ground launchers which would have a more limited delivery capability).  A hydrogen bomb should be distinguished from an atomic bomb as the former uses fusion technology and would be capable of far more damage and decimation that an atomic bomb, which uses fission technology.    Of course, it should be noted that even an atomic bomb would be capable of catastrophic destruction, as evidenced by the horrific effects of the atomic bombs that struck the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II.   Since then, the very threat of any country using a nuclear bomb has been the most pressing global security concern, which guides international policy-making.  The Obama administration in the United States wasted no time in casting doubt on North Korea's claim of  a successful hydrogen bomb test.   While State Department spokesperson,  John Kirby, said, ""The U.S. government judges North Korea to have conducted a nuclear test yesterday,""  he indicated that  analysis indicated that the test was not actually that of  a hydrogen bomb.   White House spokesperson,  Josh Earnest,  emphasized that his country had no reason to change its view of the threat posed by North Korea.  Indeed, he essentially suggested that there was no reason to believe that North Korea actually had made notable strides in nuclear technology to the extent that it was now capable of producing and testing a hydrogen bomb.  He said,  ""Nothing that has occurred in the last 24 hours has caused the United States government to change our assessment of North Korea's technical and military capabilities.""  Even if the test was not that of a true hydrogen bomb, it would nevertheless mark the fourth nuclear test carried out by North Korea since 2006 and could only be understood as a blatant act of defiance,  a flagrant violation of existing United Nations Security Council Resolutions against North Korea, and a grave threat to global security.  There was no shortage of condemnation from the international community.  United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon characterized North Korea's latest nuclear test  as ""deeply troubling"" and warned that it was ""profoundly destabilizing for regional security.""  Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said that the nuclear test  also constituted a violation of international law, as he added, ""This test once again violates numerous Security Council resolutions despite the united call by the international community to cease such activities.""  South Korea blasted North Korea for  challenging global peace and violating international law.  Japan's government said the test was a threat to Japan and could not be tolerated.   Russia's ambassador to the United Nations, Vitaly Churkin, said that his country was hoping that  ""cool heads"" would prevail  and that Russia would recommend a ""proportionate response"" to the nuclear test.   China -- North Korea's closest ally -- said that it ""firmly opposed"" the test and noted that it occurred ""irrespective of the international community's opposition.""  Precisely because of its position as North Korea's closest ally, all eyes were on China, hoping that country could make progress communicating with the difficult North Korean regime.   However, China seemed to sidestep that responsibility, with its Foreign Ministry simply urging North Korea to adhere to its denuclearization promises and avoiding further provocative action.  A statement from that ministry read as follows: ""Achieving denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and safeguarding the peninsula's peace and stability accords with all parties' mutual interests, is the responsibility of all parties, and requires all parties to put forth efforts.""  The United States reacted to that statement by urging China to relinquish its ""business as usual"" relationship with North Korea and with United States Secretary of State John Kerry making the following statement in a news conference:  ""China had a particular approach that it wanted to make, that we agreed and respected to give them space to implement that,"" Kerry told reporters after the phone call. ""Today, in my conversation with the Chinese, I made it very clear that has not worked and we cannot continue business as usual.""  Not surprisingly, the broader international community made clear that North Korea would suffer consequences.  To this end, the United Nations Security Council issued a condemnation of North Korea, excoriating that country for being  ""a clear threat to international peace and security"" and saying  it would prepare a new tranche of punitive measures to be levied against North Korea for its latest act of belligerence.  Those news punitive measures would very likely come in the form of a new Security Council resolution.  That action was strongly backed by Japan, with the Japanese ambassador to the United Nations, Motohide Yoshikawa, saying,  ""The authority and credibility of the Security Council will be put in question if it does not take these measures.""   In an address to the United Nations Security Council, United States Ambassador  Samantha Power urged the body to impose ""a tough, comprehensive, and credible package of new sanctions,"" and  to ensure ""rigorous enforcement of the resolutions it has already adopted.""  Meanwhile, individual countries were wasting no time in taking unilateral action against North Korea.  At the top of the list of those countries was South Korea, which vowed that it would resume its frontier broadcasts of propaganda to the North in retaliation for its latest nuclear test.  It should be noted that the broadcasts have been the source of grave tensions between the two Koreas, leading to the deterioration of already-dismal ties between the two countries in recent times.    South Korea also increased in military readiness,  raised in cyber attack alert level, and canceled tours of the  Demilitarized Zone on the border.  Cho Tae-yong, a South Korean national security official,  warned that his country was ready to react to further provocations and acts of belligerence by the North as he said, ""Our military is at a state of full readiness, and if North Korea wages provocation, there will be firm punishment.""  As one of South Korea's closest allies, the United States deployed a  B-52 bomber to be flown over South Korea as  a show of force.   There was also some speculation about the deployment of an aircraft carrier to the Korean peninsula, according to South Korea's Yonhap News Agency; however, no further details were available at the time of writing...  For its part,  North Korea increased its troop deployments in front-line units along the border with South Korea.   Moreover, North Korea appeared undeterred by international condemnation.  Indeed, North Korean leader, King Jong-un,  called for his country to expand its  nuclear arsenal.  As reported in the state-controlled media, ""(Kim) called for bolstering up both in quality and quantity the nuclear force capable of making nuclear strikes at the U.S.-led imperialists any time and in any space ... if they encroach upon the sovereignty of the DPRK and make threatening provocations.""  State media in North Korea noted that Kin Jong-un had called   the ""detonation of more powerful H-bomb in the future.""  This alarming statement from North Korea  motivated  South Korean President Park Geun-hye to state that ""provocations"" by the North should result not simply in new sanctions, but in fact  tougher measures than before.  She said,  ""We are cooperating closely with the United States and allies to come up with effective sanctions that will make North Korea feel bone-numbing pain, not only at the Security Council but also bilaterally and multilaterally.""  The South Korean president also urged China to use its influence with North Korea productively as she said, ""I am certain that China is very well aware if such a strong will isn't followed by necessary steps, we will not be able to stop the North's fifth and sixth nuclear tests and we cannot guarantee true peace and stability.""  In the United States, there was no patience to wait for coordinated multilateral action.  In a rare moment of bipartisanship, the   House of Representatives voted decisively to pass legislation intended to expand punitive sanctions against North Korea.  It should be noted that even as the nuclear experts and global powers dismissed North Korea's claims of carrying out a hydrogen test,  the United States was also dismissing an earlier claim by North Korea that he had fired a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM).   At issue was videotaped footage released by North Korea presumably intended to support its claim that its ballistic missile technology was sufficiently developed so as to launch a nuclear warhead from a submarine.  According to North Korea, the submarine test took place in December 2015; however, analysis from experts indicated that the videotaped footage may have been  doctored.  According to the South Korea's military, the video  was very likely edited with Scud missile footage from 2014.  Likewise, experts at the  James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS) in California in the United States concluded that the footage was heavily modified.   John Schilling from the 38 North Korea monitoring website at John Hopkins University went further in noting that the footage actually indicated a failed launch and thus suggested that North Korea was not making as much technological progress in this realm as claimed.  He said, ""The failed launch, combined with testing from a barge shows that North Korea still has a long way to go to develop this system.""  He added, ""An initial operational capability of a North Korean ballistic-missile submarine is not expected before 2020.""  On Feb. 7, 2016, only weeks after its alleged hydrogen bomb test, North Korea again violated prevailing United Nations Security Resolutions and carried out a long range rocket test.   North Korea  issued a statement in which it claimed that a new Earth observation satellite, the Kwangmyongsong-4, was sent using an Unha launch vehicle from the Sohae space center in North Phyongan province and placed into orbit.  According to Pyongyang, the rocket launch was for the peaceful purpose of placing a satellite into orbit; however, typically, Pyongyang makes this type of claim in order to mask the fact that it was actually testing ballistic missile technology.  Such long range missile tests are typically understood as ways of trying to refine its ability to target an enemy nation with a nuclear bomb using ballistic missile delivery systems.   Of significance was the fact that the first stage of the rocket was prepared in such as way as to self-destruct after separation, and thus limit the ability of foreign powers to analyze the rocket debris.  That being said, the rocket's second stage was thought to have landed in the marine waters close to Luzon Island in  the Philippines -- more than 2,00  kilometers away from  its North Korean launch pad.  That distance would undoubtedly worry foreign powers, which would use their capabilities to try to locate the second stage rocket debris.   At the same time,  defense officials in the United States have disputed North Korea's claim of a successful satellite launch,  noting that in fact the device was actually  ""tumbling in orbit"" and  not capable of meaningful function.  Nevertheless,  even an unsuccessful launch of a rocket into space would provide North Korea with the opportunity to test the reliability of its rocket systems.  That alone would grant North Korea technological insight.  Moreover, the fact that North Korea had carried out the test in defiance of international law set off alarm bells across the globe.   Given the threat posed by North Korea in the aftermath of such provocative activity in 2016, United States officials made clear that they would accelerate plans to  implement a missile defense system.  Meanwhile, as was the case following the alleged hydrogen test, the United Nations Security Council reacted with a vociferous condemnation and again threatened to move forward with new punitive sanctions. But a tone of frustration appeared to come from Japan, whose envoy to the United Nations, Motohide Yoshikawa, complained that the Security Council's existing sanctions had  ""not stopped North Korea from developing nuclear weapons.""  As such,  the Japanese envoy demanded tougher measures against North Korea.  United States Ambassador Samantha Power appeared to concur, as she declared,  ""There can be no business as usual.""  The truth of the matter was that , as before, China appeared to have little appetite to move in that direction.  ***  Editor's Note on North Korea's Nuclear Test History:  In October 2006, North Korea said it intended to test a nuclear weapon.  Despite strenuous urging by the international community, including China, that North Korea not follow this course, North Korea carried out a test of a nuclear weapon. The international community responded to North Korea's announcement with widespread condemnation and a punitive United Nations Security Council resolution endorsing financial and security sanctions.  Resolution  1718 called for  the inspections on cargo going to and from North Korea to search for weapons, a ban on the sale or transfer of materials related to North Korea's unconventional weapons program, and a freeze on the transfer of funds connected with North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs. The resolution was passed under Chapter Seven, Article 41, of the United Nations Charter; however, absent from Resolution 1718 was the Chapter Seven provision that would enforce the sanctions via military force. For its part,  the North Korean government in Pyongyang decried Resolution 1718,  and warned that subsequent pressure by the United States would be regarded as  ""a declaration of war.""  April 2009 saw North Korea take provocative action by launching a communications satellite into space via rocket.  That claim was widely viewed as obfuscation of a missile test.  Then a month later in May 2009, less than three years after the earlier underground nuclear test, North Korea conducted a second such test, arguing the merits of its right to a military deterrent. Days later, North Korea announced its withdrawal from the armistice that ended the Korean War.  At the international level, the United Nations Security Council noted that the 2009 nuclear test by North Korea was a violation of Security Council Resolution 1718, which prohibits Pyongyang from carrying out nuclear tests.  In response, the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1874 in June 2009 -- a month after the underground nuclear test.  The resolution was passed under Chapter Seven, Article 41, of the United Nations Charter, and imposed further economic and commercial sanctions on North Korea.  Additionally,  it encouraged United Nations member states to search North Korean cargo in the effort to enforce those sanctions.  It should be noted that the nuclear tests in 2006 and 2009 constituted unassailable violations of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1718  and  1874, which exist in tandem with Article 41 of Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter and compel compliance by all member states. They are binding under international law.   The 2006 and 2009 nuclear tests were also breaches of  the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.  The apparent nuclear test on Feb. 12, 2013 would also stand as a flagrant violation of that treaty.  In March 2013, the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 2094 censuring North Korea for its February  nuclear test and imposing an even stricter sanctions regime on that country.  The United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the unanimous adoption of the resolution delivered a strong message to North Korea that its pursuit of nuclear weapons would not be tolerated by the international community.  Still, North Korea responded in April 2013 by cutting off its connections with South Korea, ending its armistice, threatening to re-open its Yongbyon nuclear reactor, and issuing brazen threats against South Korea and the United States.  By May 2013, the political climate appeared to have cooled.  In June 2013, there was a bizarre mix of progress and retreat on the diplomatic front as the two Koreas  planned and then cancelled bilateral negotiations; however, North Korea then proposed direct talks with the United States.  In August  2013 through September 2013, the two Koreas finally agreed to re-open operations at the jointly administered Kaesong industrial zone. But once again, there was a mix of progress and retreat as by September 2013, signs pointed to the fact that operations were being restarted at North Korea's Yongbyon reactor.  The first part of 2014 was marked by a flurry of brazen activity by North Korea in the form of ballistic missile tests, threats of a ""new form"" nuclear test, and the exchange of fire with South Korean forces in the flashpoint disputed maritime region. Later in 2014, North Korea fired short range missiles on various occasions coinciding with visits to South Korea by world leaders, such as Chinese President Xi Jinping and Pope Francis.  In early 2015, with joint military exercises looming between the United States and South Korea, North Korea launched anti-ship missiles from hover ships. North Korea's news agency  published images showing  the hover ships launching a so-called ""cutting-edge anti-ship rocket"" that would be used to secure the contested marine border with South Korea.  At the time, there was speculation as to whether Pyongyang's moves were  acts  of belligerence aimed at improving North Korea's negotiating position for the future, or, if they were intended to be blatant and irrational acts of provocation.  On Jan. 6,  2016, North Korea carried out its fourth nuclear tests in flagrant violation of prevailing United Nations resolutions.  With Pyongyang claiming to  have successfully  carried out  its first underground test of a miniaturized hydrogen bomb, the focus was not so much on Pyongyang's intent as it was on the international community's response.  Could the United Nations Security Council members close ranks and produce a new resolution?  And even if it was able to do so, would that document be any more capable of preventing North Korea from continued violations of international law?   The answers to those questions remained elusive at the time of writing.  ***  Editor's Note on North Korea's Nuclear Capability:  The main question is whether or not North Korea can make good on its threats against the United States are its allies.  It was clear that both South Korea and Japan were within range of potential North Korean missile attacks.   North Korea's medium-range Nodong 1, a single-stage liquid-propelled weapon based on Soviet ""Scud"" technology, could reach Japanese and South Korean targets, according to an International Institute for Strategic Studies overview of North Korea's missile program.  However, that technology was not known for its targeting prowess and was thus not to be regarded as a ""precision strike"" mechanism.  Obviously, at an even further distance, the Nodong 1 could not really be regarded as a serious threat against Guam. It was possible that North Korea could  deploy its multi-stage intermediate range ballistic missile, the Taepodong, against the United States base on Guam, but the record for the Taepodong was not stellar, even failing during flight testing.  In April 2013, North Korea moved a medium-range missile, known as a Musudan or Nodong B, to its east coast. It was  not known if there was a warhead mounted on the missile, or, if the movement of the missile was part of the preparations for yet another missile test. While this Musudan/Nodong B missile has a range of 3,000 kilometers (1,875 miles), which would put all of South Korea, Japan and possibly Guam in its range, there was no reliable test history to ensure precision.  A missile launch would ostensibly be aimed at acquiring that flight test history, thus driving South Korea to deploy warships with missile defense systems to the coasts.  It should be noted that the Kn-o8 missile was believed to have enough range to hit United States terrain such as Alaska, Hawaii, and Guam.  This missile was actually displayed at a recent North Korean military parade.  However, there were some suggestions that the missile was not yet viable, with some experts even suggesting it was only a ""mock-up"" missile.  The longer range option for North Korea would likely be the multi-stage rocket, the Unha-3, which was used to launch a satellite into space  in late 2012. Theoretically,  the Unha  -- with its range of 10,000 kilometers -- could deliver a nuclear warhead-sized payload as far as Alaska or Hawaii or even California.  However,  as noted by the Center for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS), previous launches of Unha-based rockets have not been terribly successful, raising questions about the technology's reliability.  Moreover,  unlike most intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICMBs) which use  solid fuel, the Unha-3 is powered by liquid fuel, which cannot  be stored for long periods inside the rocket.  Accordingly, the Unha-3 was a liquid-fueled rocket, it would have to sit on a launch pad for lengthy periods of time for fueling, leaving it essentially vulnerable to a strike. For all these reasons, the CNS has concluded that while the Unha was evidence of North Korea's missile capability, it was  not deemed to be ""a reliable system capable of delivering a nuclear weapon to the continental United States.""  Still,  the navy of South Korea obtained first stage debris from the 2012 Unha launch and concluded that North Korea had made some technological strides.  Notably, the missile showed a capacity for steering thanks to the use of small auxiliary engines instead of jet vanes.  Another consideration as regards North Korea's progress on nuclear development was the use of uranium versus plutonium in nuclear testing.  It is widely believed that North Korea  used plutonium as fissile material for nuclear tests undertaken in 2006 and 2009.  But there were suspicions by experts that  North Korea might have used uranium in its recent (February 2013) nuclear test. The use of uranium  could indicate North Korea's intent to expand its nuclear arsenal through uranium enrichment.  In 2013, the general consensus  was that North Korea had not  (yet) developed the technology to manufacture a  miniaturized nuclear device small enough to fit on a ballistic missile, which would be needed to carry out a nuclear attack on the United States.  North Korea has carried out nuclear weapons tests and has made it clear that future tests were in the offing. But producing a nuclear explosion was not the same as producing a nuclear device small enough to fit on the top of a missile that could be delivered across an extensive range of territory.  Indeed, not only do nuclear warheads have to be small enough to fit on a missile, they also have to be able to durable enough to withstand intense heat, as well as the vibration of re-entry, and they need to possess the precision to arrive at their intended targets.  As noted by  Greg Thielmann, a senior fellow at the Arms Control Association, ""Based on the testing we've seen and some other assumptions about North Korean abilities, we don't think they're ready to arm an ICBM with a nuclear warhead yet even if they had an ICBM, which they don't yet.""  That being said, a new assessment of North Korea's nuclear capability conducted by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA)  of the Pentagon  concluded with ""moderate confidence"" that North Korea had, for the first time, learned how to manufacture a nuclear weapon small enough to be delivered via a ballistic missile.  The precise language used by the Defense Intelligence Agency was as follows: ""North currently has nuclear weapons capable of delivery by ballistic missiles however the reliability will be low.""  The assessment,  portions of which were publicized in a report by the New York Times on April 11, 2013, was a sobering and disturbing revelation at a time of heightened tensions on the Korean peninsular.  Related to this report was emerging insight derived from debris from the rocket used by the North Koreans to launch a satellite into space in December 2012.  The United States Navy was able to retrieve the front section of the rocket for study by experts, thus contributing to assessments about possible warhead designs by the North Koreans. According to media reports, that front section of the satellite rocket offered scientists evidence that North Korea was manufacturing the missile's cone at dimensions suitable for a nuclear warhead, and intended to function on a long-range missile capable of re-entry to the earth's atmosphere from space.  Anxieties over this possible benchmark by the North Koreans were likely to be assuaged by the general view that such a nuclear weapon would likely be hampered by low reliability -- a plausible deduction given North Korea's poor record of developing accurate weapons and its limited test history of missiles in its possession. As well, even if North Korea did make technological strides and was now able to make a deliverable warhead, it would still have to be able to withstand intense heat and the vibration of re-entry, and would to be sufficiently tested for target precision, as noted above.  To that end, North Korea has no test history of a re-entry vehicle and without that functional technology, it cannot deliver a warhead.  In  recent years, North Korea has made claims of miniaturization.  Indeed, in January 2016, North Korea claimed that  successfully carried out its first underground test of a miniaturized hydrogen bomb.  While experts have discounted North Korea's claim of thermonuclear strides, and concluded that North Korea more likely tested a boosted fission device rather than a hydrogen bomb, there was  not enough verifiable data available to prove of disprove the miniaturization assertion by North Korea.  It should be noted that in a report to the United States Congress at the start of May 2013,  the United States Department of Defense made clear that North Korea was aiming to move closer to its goal of striking the United States  with a nuclear-armed missile.  There was no estimate as to when North Korea might achieve that capability; however, the report surmised that progress on this front would be dependent on North Korea's degree of investment in its military program.  And to that end, North Korea was believed to be committed to becoming a nuclear powerhouse, irrespective of its domestic challenges of famine, starvation, and economic strife. The report emphasized the view that North Korea's key strategic aim was to deploy  ""coercive diplomacy"" to force the international community to accept its nuclear ambitions.  No reference in this report was made of the aforementioned conclusions of the DIA.  For its part, the United States government has long maintained the position that it has the ability to protect the homeland. To that end, in mid-March 2013, the Obama administration in the United States said it would deploy additional ballistic-missile interceptors along the country's Pacific Coast, with an eye on protecting the United States from a potential attack from North Korea. The deployment of  additional ballistic-missile interceptors  would increase the number (currently based in California and Alaska) from 30 to 44. As well, the United States  moved its  sea-based  X-Band radar platform, normally based in Hawaii, closer to the North Korean coast, with the intent of monitoring  potential attempts from North Korea to launch a long-range missile.  The radar system also possesses the capability to search and track targets, as well as communicate with interceptor missiles at overseas bases that can shoot down  missiles.  By April 2013, the United States  decided to deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense system to Guam.  The anti-ballistic missile interceptor system and the X-Band radar platform  do not  guarantee protection against a possible North Korean attack; however, they are intended to deter Pyongyang, which has been known to have only a limited intercontinental ballistic missile arsenal.  Experts have concluded that  North Korea simply does not have the military capability to carry out a nuclear strike on United States territory.  In May 2013, in an effort to show that the United States was fully prepared to defend itself from the potential nuclear missile threat posed by North Korea or any other belligerent nation state, the Missile Defense Agency along with the United States Navy  completed a successful test of a missile defense system as it destroyed a target launched in the Pacific Ocean.  According to  the  Department of Defense, a short-range ballistic missile target was launched  from the Pacific Missile Range Facility on the Hawaiian island of Kauai;  the USS Lake Erie was able to  detect and track the missile, then launch a blocking missile with a kinetic warhead, which successfully destroyed the target.  United States officials said the test operation in Hawaii demonstrated that the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense system was fully functional.  Should a confrontation actually emerge, North Korea would be helped by the fact that its  army is the fifth largest in the world; however,  it is also inexperienced having not seen combat since 1953, and having been deprived of the superior and sophisticated training available to the smaller South Korean military, or the extensive United States military industrial complex.  As well, a great deal of North Korea's military equipment is outdated in comparison to Western powers.  That being said, even outdated military equipment can still (presumably) function and thus North Korea poses  a real and serious threat to global security.  Retired United States Admiral Dennis Blair, a former head of the United States Pacific Command and  director of national intelligence in the Obama administration, cautioned against taking a sanguine stance in response to the North Korean threat posed in 2013.  He said in an interview with Bloomberg News, ""I'm not relaxed about this one...I think this one's more dangerous.""  Most experts on North Korea posit the view that Pyongyang is not really prepared to ignite a conflict that would ensure its own destruction; however, they note that Kim Jong-un's inexperience could lead to misunderstanding and miscalculations with potentially catastrophic consequences.  For example, regardless of its intended target, a missile launched by the North that appears to be headed towards South Korea or Japan -- accidentally or otherwise -- would clearly yield a response from those countries or the United States.  That response could itself be a catalyst for a deadly confrontation among players armed with no shortage of conventional weapons,  not to mention nuclear bombs.  Indeed, Admiral Samuel J. Locklear, the top United States commander in the Pacific, said during testimony before the Senate Armed Services committee on April 9, 2013, that while the United States would not opt to shoot down a North Korean missile aimed for open waters, interceptors would be used to defend against a North Korean missile perceived as threatening the interests of the United States or its allies.  It was an unknown matter as to how a paranoid regime like North Korea would itself respond to such defensive action.  Meanwhile, as noted by then-United States Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel of his country's ability to respond to threats posed by North Korea: ""We have every capacity to deal with any action that North Korea would take, to protect this country and the interests of this country and our allies."" At the same news conference with Hagel,  General Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the United States military Joint Chiefs of Staff,  would not say if he believe North Korea had been able to make a nuclear warhead small enough to fit onto a ballistic missile; however, he warned that the United States need to be prepared for the worst possible scenarios.  Dempsey said: ""They [the North Koreans] have conducted two nuclear tests. They have conducted several successful ballistic missile launches. And in the absence of concrete evidence to the contrary, we have to assume the worst case, and that's why we're postured as we are today.""  In 2014, North Korea was showing little restraint on the matter of ballistic missile tests and was now threatening to carry out another  nuclear test -- this one of a ""new form"" variety.  Once again, in keeping with Martin Dempsey's prudent warning mentioned just above -- in the absence of clear data regarding North Korea's nuclear capabilities and recent technological strides, the global community interested in security and stability would do well not to dismiss North Korea as simply indulging in saber rattling.   The 2016 nuclear test carried out by North Korea would underline this warning in stark terms.  In 2016, following North Korea's claim of having produced a hydrogen bomb, along with its launch of the  Kwangmyongsong-4  satellite  into space, questions about North Korea's intercontinental ballistic missile technology, capable of delivering a nuclear bomb, again surfaced.  Of note was the question of whether or not North Korea could dispatch a nuclear-armed missile to a target in another country, such as Japan or the United States.  As before this question focused on the matter of whether or not  North Korea's  intercontinental ballistic missile technology was capable of transporting a nuclear payload accurately over  a long distances.   In truth, only intense testing for reliability could guarantee such an end and North Korea's test history remained limited.  But even satellite launch -- even failed ones -- provide data for missile technology experts and that fact cannot be ignored.  Still, North Korea would have to be able to successfully develop a  miniaturized nuclear weapons that could fit on the top of a rocket, and it would also have to be stable enough to withstand intense heat and  re-entry into the atmosphere.   There were some fears being expressed by United States experts that North Korea had made strides in the miniaturization process; however, the government of the United States has insisted this was not the case.   The ""re-entry"" aspect was also unsettled as some experts have suggested that North Korea  may well have developed a ""re-entry vehicle.""  Of course the remaining problem for North Korea was that there was little guarantee that its missiles could be delivered with reliability and accuracy.  Given these considerations, back in 2015, the United States National Security Council spokesperson, Patrick Ventrell, issued the following statement:  ""Our assessment of North Korea's nuclear capabilities has not changed. We do not think that they have that capacity.""  He added, ""However, they are working on developing a number of long-range missiles, including intercontinental ballistic missiles, that could eventually threaten our allies and the homeland.""  That warning could only be understood as even more pertinent in 2016.   ***  Special Entry:  Events pertaining to North Korea's 2016 nuclear activities  Deteriorating relations on Korean Peninsula

Relations on the Korean peninsula deteriorated in the period in early 2016 when North Korea carried out a hydrogen bomb test and launched a satellite into space, the latter of which was generally regarded as a ruse for a ballistic missile test.   The two actions were regarded as virulent acts of provocation, committed in flagrant contravention of international law,  and thus constituted a threat to regional -- if not global -- security, .    Tensions on the Korean peninsula deteriorated further in February 2016 when South Korea decided to suspend operations at the  Kaesong industrial zone, which has been jointly administered by the two Koreas and viewed as a venue for cooperation.  South Korea made the move in response to North Korea's provocative and belligerent actions, as noted just above.  But North Korea itself reacted by evicting all South Koreans from the   Kaesong industrial zone  and accusing South Korea of effectively ""declaring war.""   The Democratic People's Republic of Korea's (DPRK)   Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea released a statement that read as follows: ""Unpardonable is the puppet group's act of totally suspending the operation in (Kaesong), finding fault with the DPRK's H-bomb test and launch of a satellite."" United States says it rejected peace treaty proposal by North Korea because it did not include denuclearization provisions In February 2016, the United States Department of State said that it had recently  rejected a peace treaty proposal by North Korea because it did not include provisions for  denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula.  in response to a question posed during a Wall Street Journal interview, John Kirby, the spokesperson for the United States Department of State,  acknowledged that the White House agreed to go forward with  peace talks with North Korea, which would broadly encompass many issues including North Korea's nuclear program.  However,  North Korea was not interested in peace talks that included a discussion of its nuclear arsenal, and then on Jan. 6, 2016, went forward with its claimed hydrogen bomb test.  That move effectively ended the diplomatic track.  Of significance, according to  Kirby, was the fact that North Korea initiated the contact over a proposed  peace treaty.  As noted by Kirby,  ""To be clear, it was the North Koreans who proposed discussing a peace treaty."" United States and China reach agreement on draft resolution expanding sanctions against North Korea over nuclear activities In late February 2016,  in response to North Korea's provocative nuclear activities in contravention of international law, the United States and China arrived at an agreement  intended to expand United Nations Security Council sanctions against that country.  In the aftermath of North Korea's hydrogen bomb test in January 2016,  Washington D. C. and  Beijing have been ensconced in  rigorous negotiations aimed at drafting a  draft resolution. The two sides were not in complete agreement about what types of initiatives should be undertaken,  with Beijing favoring dialogue and advocating non-proliferation, and with Washington D.C. pushing for more stringent punitive  measures, including curbs on Pyongyang's ability to access the global financial system.  Other provisions being explored included mandatory inspections on cargo passing from or to North Korea, a  ban on all supplies of aviation and rocket fuel to North Korea,  and a ban on the transfer to North Korea of any item that could be used for military purposes. Despite the distance on some of these items, Washington D. C. and  Beijing were finally able to find concurrence and craft the draft resolution, which they hoped would be introduced and  voted on in the full 15-member United Nations Security Council at the start of March 2016.  Of significance was the fact that the resolution was passed into international law. Significantly, North Korea reacted to  the Security Council resolution by casting it as a ""criminal act"" orchestrated  by the United States and vowed to continue its nuclear proliferation activities. A government spokesperson said in an interview with the state-controlled KCNA media said, ""Our response will involve the full use of various means and tools including a strong and ruthless physical response."" North Korean leader instructs military to be ready to use nuclear weapons and makes miniaturization claims; U.S. discusses missile defense shield  protection with South Korea In the first week of March 2016, North Korea's leader,  Kim Jong-un, declared that his country's nuclear weapons should be made  ready for use ""at any time"" and  in a ""pre-emptive attack"" mode.   According to state media in North Korea, King Jong-un called on the military to adjust its posture so that it could launch pre-emptive strikes upon demand.   As stated by Kim Jong-un, North Korea  ""Now is the time for us to convert our mode of military counteraction toward the enemies into a pre-emptive attack one in every aspect.""  He added that North Korea ""must always be ready to fire our nuclear warheads at any time"" due to the threat posed by the country's enemies. Kim Jong-un identified those enemies, as follows: ""At an extreme time when the Americans... are urging war and disaster on other countries and people, the only way to defend our sovereignty and right to live is to bolster our nuclear capability.""   There were some suggestions that this move by North Korea, which was accompanied by a volley of short-range missile launched into the sea, constituted a belligerent response to the tough sanctions imposed by the United Nations on North Korea for its recent provocative nuclear activities.   As is usually the case with North Korea,  the move could only mean an escalation of tensions on the Korean peninsula. The United States Pentagon reacted with the spokesperson issuing the following statement: ""We urge North Korea to refrain from provocative actions that aggravate tensions and instead focus on fulfilling its international obligations and commitments.""  As well, the United States convened talks with South Korea aimed at possibly deploying an American missile defense shield to the South Korea.  To that end, the discussion would focus on the feasibility financially and environmentally of installing the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system in South Korea, along with its effectiveness in potentially shooting down short and medium-range ballistic missiles, thus destroying incoming warheads.  Of note was the fact that the THAAD was already installed in Hawaii and Guam to protect the United States from potential attacks from North Korea. Those defense systems would be of paramount importance given North Korea's claims on March 9, 2016, that its scientists had made technological strides and developed miniaturized nuclear warheads that could be fitted on ballistic missiles.   Of significance was the fact that North Korea state media has  published photographs of Kim Jong-un  at the testing event of a multiple launch rocket system, and also posing with what was claimed to be miniaturized weapon.  It should be noted that there was no verification of North Korea's claims in these regards although the release of the images was clearly geared to proving its claims.

",941663,"A newEbolaoutbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo is suspected to have killed 19 people and infected nearly two dozen others so far.

The country reported 39 suspected, probable or confirmed cases of the virus between April 4 and May 13, theWorld Health Organizationsaid.

These included 19 deaths, the agency added in a statement today.

And 393 people who identified as contacts of Ebola patients are being followed up - as experts try to prevent the spread of the epidemic.

The news has sparked concern just a few years after the virus swept across West Africa between 2014 and 2016, killing more than 11,300 people.

                     New Ebola outbreak kills 17 people in Congo just two years after disease wiped out 11,000 in west Africa                   

Information about the recent outbreak in Bikoro, Iboko and Wangata health zones in Equateur province is still limited, according to the WHO.

At present, the outbreak does not meet the criteria for declaring a ""public health event of international concern"", which would trigger the formation of an emergency WHO committee.

The latest statement comes after the DRC and UN agencies began deploying emergency teams of specialists over the weekend in a bid to prevent the spread of the outbreak,

The WHO obtained 4,000 doses of an experimental Ebola vaccine and was preparing for deployment in Congo, its Africa director, Matshidiso Moeti, told Reuters by telephone yesterday.

                     British tourists warned about Madagascar plague epidemic which has claimed 94 lives                   

Only two cases have so far been confirmed in a laboratory.

Moeti said hundreds of contacts had been traced of those who had fallen sick - a necessary precursor to deploying the vaccines.

She added that two of those contacts had got to the provincial capital, Mbandaka. The biggest worry since the epidemic was identified has been that it could spread there.

""We're concerned because this is a city of 1 million people,"" she said

Congo first reported the outbreak, centred on the village of Ikoko Impenge, near the town of Bikoro, on Tuesday. Some deaths occurring as early as January have not yet been linked to the epidemic.

                     Hopes for AIDS cure rise as nine-year-old HIV patient goes into remission despite stopping medication                   

""It is evident that two or three months earlier, some cases of hemorrhagic fever and some deaths occurred,"" Moeti said.

""Work is under way to determine the beginning of this epidemic.""

Officials are racing to prevent the virus from spreading out of control, as previously happened in West Africa when it killed thousands of people.

Congo has suffered a number of previous Ebola epidemics.

But owing to remote geography and poor transport links, they tended to fizzle out rather than spread to become a national crisis.

But the latest epidemic's proximity to the Congo River, a major transport route and lifeline both to Congo's capital, Kinshasa, and to neighbouring Congo Republic's capital, Brazzaville, makes it more likely the virus could break out into a wider area.

The disease - most feared for the internal and external bleeding it can cause in its victims due to damage done to blood vessels - has already spread to three locations covering 37 miles or more in Equateur province.

Congo's nine neighbours have been put on high alert in case Ebola crosses a border, especially to Republic of Congo or Central African Republic.

""The WHO is strengthening its presence, positioning a dozen epidemiologists who will be divided on the axes of Mbandaka, Bikoro and Iboko to investigate alerts,"" its Congo representative, Allarangar Yokouide, earlier said.

The WHO said on Friday it hoped to deploy an experimental Ebola vaccine to tackle an outbreak.

Ebola is among the most lethal diseases known to man. There is no vaccine, no cure, and it kills up to 90 per cent of sufferers.

The virus is infectious, with early symptoms including the sudden onset of fever fatigue, muscle pain, a headache and asore throat.

These may be followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, symptoms of impaired kidney and liver function and both internal and external bleeding.

With an incubation period between two and 21 days, it is possible for people to be infected with the virus without knowing it.

Ebola is spread through direct contact with infected body fluids.

                     Ebola nurse Pauline Cafferkey returns to Sierra Leone for the first time after contracting disease, to get 'closure'                   

TheWHOsays: ""Ebola is introduced into the human population through close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals such as chimpanzees, gorillas, fruit bats, monkeys, forest antelope and porcupines found ill or dead or in the rainforest.

""Ebola then spreads through human-to-human transmission via direct contact (through broken skin or mucous membranes) with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people, and with surfaces and materials (e.g. bedding, clothing) contaminated with these fluids.""

It adds that the 2014-2016 outbreak in West Africa was the ""largest and most complex Ebola outbreak since the virus was first discovered in 1976"".",7,"At present, the outbreak does not meet the criteria for declaring a ""public health event of international concern"", which would trigger the formation of an emergency WHO committee.

Now global health officials will be deploying a new tool, a vaccine against the virus that is still not licensed. Four-thousand doses have been shipped to the DRC with another 4,000 to follow soon. NPR's Nurith Aizenman reports.             

NURITH AIZENMAN:                 This vaccine was first tested in 2015 in the waning months of the massive Ebola epidemic in West Africa. Ira Longini is a biostatistician at the University of Florida who helped run that trial. Thousands of people were given the vaccine.             

IRA LONGINI:                 Not a single person that was vaccinated got infected.             

NURITH AIZENMAN:                 They did what's called a ring vaccination. For every infected person, officials locate everyone who was in close proximity and then everyone who had close contact with them. That's the ring.             

IRA LONGINI:                 Then all those people in the ring are vaccinated as quickly as possible.             

NURITH AIZENMAN:                 The vaccine wasn't just judged 100 percent effective if you get it. Even if not everyone in the ring is vaccinated, it cuts down overall transmission by about 75 percent.             

IRA LONGINI:                 Yeah, that is a big deal. It's very unusual.             

NURITH AIZENMAN:                 But by the time these results came in, the outbreak in West Africa was basically over. And since then, apart from a few very small flare-ups, there hasn't been occasion to use the vaccine. Also, it's still awaiting final licensing. That takes a while. So governments need to give special permission for it to be used. But Tarik Jasarevic, a spokesman for the World Health Organization, which is coordinating the vaccination effort, says the DRC has moved quickly to cut through the paperwork.             

TARIK JASAREVIC:                 This time around, the approvals have been done very fast.             

NURITH AIZENMAN:                 That's because of some worrisome signs about this outbreak, which is in the north.             

TARIK JASAREVIC:                 So we are talking about a remote area of small villages with no paved roads, with very difficult access. But it is on the shore of the river where there is important transport.             

NURITH AIZENMAN:                 Transport that leads to a much larger city, which means...

",1084351,"The Senate on Tuesday adopted various resolutions to prevent an outbreak of ebola virus in Nigeria.

Part of the resolutions was to urge two ministers to be pro-active in preventing an outbreak of the disease already ravaging the East African country of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

The World Health Organisation (WHO) on Monday said it has been authorised to use an experimental vaccine to combat an outbreak of Ebola in the DRC, where at least 19 people have been killed by the virus.

To forestall an outbreak in Nigeria, as experienced in Nigeria in 2014, Oluremi Tinubu (Lagos-APC) presented a motion on the issue on Tuesday.

Mrs Tinubu flashed back to the 2014 situation where a carrier immigrant from Liberia transferred the disease to Nigeria.

She said, ""The Senate recalls with great distress that an infected immigrant who arrived Nigeria on the 23rd of July was the index case of the ebola virus in Nigeria. With varying symptoms ranging from fever to diarrhoea, there were a total of 869 contacts and 20 laboratory confirmed cases were recorded.

""The Senate is be reminded that the tide was stemmed by quick response of the Nigerian government vid declaration of emergency, collaboration of federal and states Ministries of Health, use of incidence management approach, identification and follow up contacts.

""The Senate is saddened that in spite of quick measures taken, the epidemic claimed eight lives including those of medical personnel who put their lives at risk to contain the disease.

""The Senate is disturbed that recent reports of media outlets and the World Health Organisation show that the disease is back in neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo with 19 dead and 39 casualties recorded so far.

""The Senate is further reminded that DRC is 445 kilometres by air from Abuja, is easily accessible via a flight from Lagos that takes less than three hours.

""Senate also notes report of WHO stating that Nigeria and other African countries are at modest risk of spread.

""The Senate is worried that unless we prepare our hospitals properly equipped with the ebola vaccine where necessary, this is an epidemic we might be unable to take up and will only cause untold hardship.

""The Senate is further worried that if we do nothing, given our population, we may well be on our way to creating a global situation.""

Adopting the three recommendations in the motion, the Senate urged the Minister of Interior to take necessary steps to check immigration

It also urged the Minister of Health to ensure alertness to combat disease in whatever cases may rise and get the ebola vaccine ready for an emergency while advising Nigerians who travel to other African countries to ensure utmost level of care to avoid getting infected.

In an additional prayer by Chief Whip, Olusola Adeyeye, the Senate called for a quick resolution of the ongoing crisis in the health sector.",13,"""The Senate is worried that unless we prepare our hospitals properly equipped with the ebola vaccine where necessary, this is an epidemic we might be unable to take up and will only cause untold hardship.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I`m Judy Woodruff.

On the ""NewsHour"" tonight: two very different scenes in the Middle East. Amid celebrations of the U.S. Embassy opening in Jerusalem, more than 50 Palestinian protesters are killed along Israel`s border with Gaza.

Then: one on one with the health and human services secretary, Alex Azar. We discuss what the Trump administration is doing to tamp down prescription drug prices.

And putting a face on the anxiety, depression, and other mental health problems millions of college students struggle with every day.

EMILY TANG, MIT Student: I would just sit there, wrapped in a blanket. The achievement of the day was, I, you know, got out of bed. And everything felt like there was a layer of cotton or fog or something wrapped around my brain.

JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more on tonight`s ""PBS NewsHour.""

(BREAK)

JUDY WOODRUFF: Scenes of celebration mixed with deadly violence today, as the United States opened its new embassy in Jerusalem.

Israeli security forces shot dead dozens of Palestinians in Gaza who were attempting to cross the border there. Health officials there said more than 2,000 others were wounded. Blanket denunciations swept across the Arab and Muslim world, blasting both the U.S. Embassy move and the killings. Thousands marched in Istanbul, decrying what many called a massacre. And Turkey`s government announced that it would recall its ambassadors to Israel and the United States.

For its part, the Trump White House said Israel has the right to defend itself, and said responsibility for the killings -- quote -- ""rests squarely with Hamas,"" the Palestinian militant group that controls Gaza.

Special correspondent Jane Ferguson reports for us tonight from Gaza City.

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

JANE FERGUSON: Cheers erupted as President Trump`s daughter Ivanka and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin opened the new U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem, timed to coincide with the 70th anniversary of the founding of the state of Israel.

IVANKA TRUMP, Assistant to President Trump: On behalf of the president of the United States of America, we welcome you officially, and for the first time, to the embassy of the United States here in Jerusalem, the capital of Israel. Thank you.

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

JANE FERGUSON: U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman led the festive ceremony, as the American delegation looked on. President Trump hailed the move as a great day for Israel, and in a taped message from Washington, he applauded a campaign promise fulfilled.

DONALD TRUMP, President of the United States: For many years, we failed to acknowledge the obvious, the plain reality that Israel`s capital is Jerusalem.

JANE FERGUSON: Control of Jerusalem has been at the heart of the Israeli-Arab conflict ever since the United Nations drew the boundaries for a Jewish state in 1947.

The city is sacred to Christians, Muslims and Jews. One-third of its residents are Palestinian. They claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state of their own.

Mr. Trump insisted the U.S. is still dedicated to peace between Israelis and Palestinians.

DONALD TRUMP: Our greatest hope is for peace. The United States remains fully committed to facilitating a lasting peace agreement.

JANE FERGUSON: But adding to the religious strain, a pair of controversial American Christian pastors known for their deeply anti-Muslim rhetoric led prayers.

John Hagee and Robert Jeffress are vocal supporters of the president. Jeffress has decried Islam as heresy from the pit of hell, and has disparaged Mormonism and Judaism as well.

JARED KUSHNER, Senior Presidential Adviser: I am so proud to be here in Jerusalem, the eternal heart of the Jewish people.

JANE FERGUSON: The president`s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who was charged with brokering peace talks, said he`s hopeful the move will help bring a solution to the long-running conflict.

JARED KUSHNER: We have shown that the United States of America can be trusted.

JANE FERGUSON: Finally, Israel`s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared it a glorious day.

BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, Israeli Prime Minister: Thank you, President Trump, for having the courage to keep your promises. Our brave soldiers are protecting the borders of Israel as we speak today.

JANE FERGUSON: But on those borders, that protecting meant deadly violence across the Palestinian territories, and scenes of bloodshed set against the Jerusalem celebrations.

In Gaza, tens of thousands gathered near the border with Israel, trying to make it over the fence. The Palestinians are calling for their right of return to the ancestral homes they lived in before Israel was founded, an event called the Nakba, or Catastrophe, by Palestinians.

MAN: We are now next to the Israeli border, next to our occupied village. The Israelis stole our village and dismissed us from our village.

JANE FERGUSON: From Ramallah on the West Bank, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas denounced Israel and its reaction to the protests.

MAHMOUD ABBAS, Palestinian Authority President (through translator): Today`s massacres continue against our people in the Gaza and on the West Bank. This is not an embassy. It`s a U.S. settlement outpost.

JANE FERGUSON: These protests have been going on for six weeks, but today, amid the embassy move, anger here reached new levels. The crowd that has shown up today is significantly larger than they have seen in recent weeks, which they have been calling for, but they are, as you can see, occasionally rushing the fence.

The Israelis are not showing any patience for that. They have been firing sniper rounds. And we have seen ambulances leaving the area with the injured. Dozens of protesters have been brought just to this one medical spot, and all of them have been shot in the leg.

So many people arrived with gunshot wounds, many were forced to lay on the ground outside in agony, waiting to be taken to hospital.

With another day of protest declared for tomorrow, the bloodshed in Gaza will go on long after the celebrations in Jerusalem.

Judy, as of now, the death toll is at least 55 here, the deadliest day since the 2014 war.

JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Jane, were the Palestinians expecting these protests to be so large, for there to be such a large turnout?

JANE FERGUSON: They were expecting that. They have been calling on people to come out.

Now, we drove around Gaza City this morning just ahead of the protests, almost every single shop shut down. Now, there`s been a big push to get people out to these protests to make sure that that the numbers were big, today in particular, with the embassy move going on in Jerusalem.

That said, on Sunday, we did hear news that the head of Hamas had gone to Egypt at the very last minute to somehow broker a deal to try to prevent what happened today from happening.

We have heard that an offer was made of perhaps being able to ease the blockade, ease the closing of the border with Egypt, the Rafah crossing. Whatever was offered was clearly not accepted, it was acceptable to Hamas.

And, as a result, today, we saw the protests go on as expected.

JUDY WOODRUFF: So, an indirect attempt to negotiate with Israel.

Jane, we have seen some reporting -- even though the Palestinians are saying that all this protest is spontaneous, we have also seen reporting saying that, on the Gaza side, loudspeakers were encouraging young people to rush the fence. What do you know about that?

JANE FERGUSON: Well, there`s certainly been a big encouragement to get people going to these protests.

And all political parties and armed groups are keen to make sure there`s a huge turnout, and that includes Hamas. Hamas, of course, very much so want to be able to use these protests for political leverage.

This is something of a new tactic to have unarmed protests of this level, of this size, so it`s certainly an important tactic. They know that so long as these protests are unarmed, they will be all the more potent and all the more politically useful.

But we have seen, when we`re out there, those rushing the fence are unarmed, in the sense that they`re not carrying guns and weapons as such. We have seen young people with stones in hand and homemade slingshots. They burn tires to create smoke to sort of give themselves cover.

They haven`t really been able to get to the fence itself or in any way threaten the Israeli soldiers there with being able to really come over it, but every time that they approach the fence, they are fired upon.

JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Jane, you were telling us you have been -- clearly, there have been a lot of casualties. You were telling us you have been to field hospitals there to see the injured, a lot of gunshot wounds, and you were telling us many of them below the knee?

JANE FERGUSON: Absolutely.

You know, along with those 55 dead today, we have also had a massive number of casualties. The authorities here say over 2,700 people. Most of the people, according to medical sources, who have been injured have received gunshot wounds to the lower leg.

Now, when I was in a field hospital very, very close to where the protesters were pushing towards the fence with Israel, we saw an enormous amount of casualties coming in, and 90 percent of them had gunshot wounds to the leg, mostly below the knee.

Israeli snipers are shooting people in the leg whenever they get close to the fence, and that`s causing widespread, widespread gunshot wounds that we`re seeing on many, many protesters. And that`s why those casualty figures are fairly significant, because those gunshot wounds are leading to all sorts of complications like amputations.

JUDY WOODRUFF: What a story.

And, Jane Ferguson, we thank you so much for following it.

JANE FERGUSON: Thank you.

JUDY WOODRUFF: It was also a momentous day in Iraq following a weekend parliamentary election that has left a firebrand cleric leading the vote count.

As Nick Schifrin reports, the U.S.-backed incumbent prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, is running third in most districts and a distant fifth in Baghdad.

NICK SCHIFRIN: Supporters of Muqtada al-Sadr flooded the streets of the Baghdad district named for the Shiite cleric`s family. They celebrated a former symbol of sectarianism and resistance who`s transformed himself into a populist leader on the verge of leading Iraq.

Iraq`s electoral commission has released results from 90 percent of the country, showing a startling apparent upset. Sadr`s nationalist alliance, Saeroun, as the front-runner, and Sadr himself as expected kingmaker.

Sadr rose to prominence after the U.S.-led overthrow of Saddam Hussein. In 2004, Sadr`s Mahdi Army fought a brutal, bloody insurgency against coalition forces, demanding they withdraw from the country. His men also targeted Sunni Iraqis, helping spark the civil war that ripped through Iraq in 2006.

Recently, he rebranded himself as a nationalist, anti-U.S. and anti- Iran. He tapped into widespread disappointment that neither country helped improve Iraqi lives. And he campaigned against endemic corruption. His allies were communists and secular parties, and he wants a government of technocrats.about

MUQTADA AL-SADR, Iraqi Political Leader (through translator): We are moving to a free and independent Iraq. We`re going to move to an Iraq safe from corruption, terrorism and militias.

NICK SCHIFRIN: In second place, the Iranian-backed Hadi Al-Amiri, and in third place, the U.S.-backed current Prime Minister Haider Al-Abadi. In a national address, Al-Abadi called on Iraqis to respect the results.

HAIDER AL-ABADI, Iraqi Prime Minister (through translator): We are ready to work and cooperate on forming the strongest government for Iraq, free of corruption, hateful confessionalism and unsubjected to a foreign agenda, a government which is capable of preventing a return of terrorism and keeping the country away from sliding into marginal conflicts.

NICK SCHIFRIN: For four years, Iraq`s been fighting ISIS, but the vote was remarkably peaceful, and defined by bread and butter issues. Iraqi unemployment is soaring.

The country needs $80 billion of reconstruction. Two million, mostly Sunnis, are displaced. But turnout was low, and skepticism high. Some Baghdad residents are skeptical this political upset can upset a corrupt system.

MAN (through translator): Nothing will be changed. The same misery for the country.

NICK SCHIFRIN: If his bloc is the confirmed winner, Sadr won`t become prime minister. But 15 years after the U.S. invasion, the man once described as the U.S.` top enemy in Iraq will be responsible for shaping Iraq`s destiny.

For the ""PBS NewsHour,"" I`m Nick Schifrin.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Back in this country: The Supreme Court has ruled that states have the power to legalize sports betting. The case came from New Jersey, a state that fought for years to legalize sports bets at casinos and race tracks.

Brenda Flanagan of NJTV News has that background.

DENNIS DRAZIN, Monmouth Park: My intention, unless somebody stops us, to be up and running in two weeks. If the legislation or the governor says slow down, I`m going to listen to them.

BRENDA FLANAGAN: Dennis Drazin runs Monmouth Park, a racetrack that expanded its bar and lounge to accommodate sports wagering, betting New Jersey would win its decade-long court battle to overturn the federal ban on legalized sports betting in most states.

Major League sports fought New Jersey all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which today ruled that ban is unconstitutional, a David vs. Goliath victory for the former legislator who filed Jersey`s lawsuit.

RAYMOND LESNIAK, Former New Jersey State Senator: Fighting every step of the way, having no one believe that I could win, and now finally coming home with a victory, and the benefits to the state, it`s sweet, a sweet feeling.

BRENDA FLANAGAN: The high court ruled 6-3 that states could not be forced to regulate sports betting at the same time they were barred from legalizing it. Nevada was the only state that could offer a full slate of sports wagering options under the 1992 federal ban. Meanwhile, illegal sports betting flourished.

But the Supreme Court ruling just created a whole new legal marketplace.

RUMMY PANDIT, Executive Director, Lloyd D. Levenson Institute of Gaming, Hospitality and Tourism: The illegal market is about -- is estimated close to $150 billion. Vegas last year, where this is legal, had about $250 million in revenues in sports wagering. So, we anticipate that we in Atlantic city, once it`s up and running, could be anywhere close to $150 million.

BRENDA FLANAGAN: It`s tough to gauge economic impact because individual states must enact their own sports betting statutes. Six, including New Jersey, already have laws on the books; 13 others have introduced legislation.

The NFL`s still playing defense on this issue, stating: ""We intend to call on Congress again, this time to enact a core regulatory framework for legalized sports betting. We also will work closely with our clubs to ensure that any state efforts that move forward in the meantime protect our fans and the integrity of our game.""

Drazin says that, in two weeks, Monmouth park will start taking limited hand bets on future wagers, like the Super Bowl, perhaps, while New Jersey enacts a regulatory framework. DraftKings is maneuvering to offer a mobile online platform in New Jersey. Some analysts expect legalized sports betting here by July 4.

For the ""PBS NewsHour,"" I`m Brenda Flanagan in Newark, New Jersey.

JUDY WOODRUFF: In Indonesia, where the Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for a suicide bomb attack at a police building. It happened in Surabaya, the country`s second biggest city. The attack was carried out by a family of militants, including an 8-year-old; 10 officers and civilians were wounded.

Indonesia`s president pushed for a new anti-terror bill.

JOKO WIDODO, Indonesian President (through translator): This morning, another suicide bomb happened in Surabaya. This is the act of cowards, an undignified and barbaric action. And I want to urge everyone, we will fight terrorism and we will eliminate the root cause of it.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Today`s attack follows bombings yesterday by another militant family at three churches in the city. At least 13 people were killed.

Powerful winds, dust and rainstorms have swept across Northern India, killing at least 43 people. It comes less than two weeks after similar weather killed 134 people and injured hundreds more. Winds reached about 70 miles per hour in parts Sunday. They uprooted trees, demolished buildings, and overturned vehicles.

The World Health Organization now has permission to use an experimental Ebola vaccine in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Officials reported 39 Ebola cases in the country between April 4 and yesterday, including 19 deaths. Still, the WHO says the outbreak doesn`t meet the criteria for a public health event of international concern.

The WHO also announced today an effort to rid the world of trans fats by 2023. The organization will provide guidance to countries on removing the heart-clogging additives out of their food supplies.

The former head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control says the initiative was a matter of life and death. He spoke in Geneva.

DR. THOMAS FRIEDEN, Former Director, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: The bottom line here is that this is the beginning of the end for industrially produced trans fats. The days of trans fats are numbered. Governments of the world now have the tools and the knowledge and the responsibility to protect their people from this toxic chemical.

JUDY WOODRUFF: The WHO estimates that eating trans fats leads to more than 500,000 deaths from heart disease every year.

The U.S. is now exploring into different ways to deal with sanctions violations by a Chinese telecom giant. The government banned exports to ZTE last month over its dealings with Iran and North Korea. But President Trump now says he wants to give the company a way back into business.

In a tweet today, he noted ZTE buys a big percentage of parts from U.S. manufacturers, adding the move is -- quote -- ""reflective of the larger trade deal we are negotiating with China.""

Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross spoke in Washington.

WILBUR ROSS, U.S. Commerce Secretary: ZTE did do some inappropriate things. They have admitted to that. The question is, are there alternative remedies to one that we had originally put forward? And that`s the area we will be exploring very, very promptly.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Mr. Trump`s message, tweeted yesterday, drew condemnation from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. Florida Republican Senator Marco Rubio said he hoped the president wasn`t -- quote -- ""backing down to China.""

Stocks jumped early today on hopes of easing trade tensions between the U.S. and China, but they finished mixed. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 80 -- 68 points, that is, to close at 24899. The Nasdaq rose eight points. And the S&P added two.

Prosecutors in Missouri have dropped tonight one felony charge against Governor Eric Greitens. It is for invasion of privacy of a woman he has admitted to having an affair with. They plan to refile with a special prosecutor. Greitens still faces charges related to his alleged use of his former nonprofit donor list to solicit campaign donations.

The White House says first lady Melania Trump has been hospitalized after a procedure for a benign kidney condition. A spokeswoman said the procedure was successful with no complications, but didn`t elaborate on her specific kidney condition.

Late today, the president went to visit Mrs. Trump at Walter Reed Hospital, outside Washington, where she will likely stay for the rest of the week.

Meanwhile, former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is recovering from surgery for pancreatic cancer. Reid`s family said the doctors caught the cancer early and that the prognosis for his recovery is good. The retired Nevada Democrat will now go through chemotherapy.

And famed actress Margot Kidder has died. The Canadian-born star was best known for playing intrepid reporter Lois Lane, opposite Christopher Reeve, in the 1978 film ""Superman"" and its three sequels. Kidder had been living in Montana in recent years and spent much of her time in political activism. Margot Kidder was 69 years old.

Still to come on the ""NewsHour"": the health and human services secretary on the president`s plan to reduce prescription drug prices; putting a spotlight on college students` mental health; Capitol Hill staffers speak out about sexual harassment; and much more.

And now to the president`s point man on prescription drug costs and what Mr. Trump proposed last week to lower prices.

His plan aims to improve competition for drugs, in part by speeding generic drugs to market, give Medicare-approved insurance plans more power to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies over the prices of just some drugs, use trade deals to force other countries to pay for drugs they buy from the U.S., with the hope that it would lower -- would lead to lower costs here, and potentially require drug-makers to disclose their list prices as part of advertising.

But the president backed away from what he once called for as a candidate: allowing Medicare to use its full power and leverage to negotiate prices directly with drug-makers.

Alex Azar is the secretary of health and human services, and he joins me now.

Mr. Secretary, thank you very much for being with us.

ALEX AZAR, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary: Thanks, Judy.

JUDY WOODRUFF: So, as we just said, you have outlined a number of things you`re doing, but what -- people are pointing to what the president said as a candidate and even as president.

He said, look, the biggest negotiating power is from the federal government itself. It buys more drugs than anybody else. Why not have an overall -- overall, let Medicare negotiate with drug companies?

ALEX AZAR: That is completely what the president`s plan would do.

This has been a great misunderstanding or misrepresentation that`s happened out there. What the president has called for is, in the two biggest parts of the Medicare program where we pay for drugs, Medicare Part D, which is that retail pharmacy program for senior citizens, to increase the power of the drug plans that we currently have negotiating for our seniors, give them the power to better negotiate, just like commercial plans do.

And then take this whole other segment, Part B, which is the drugs that you would get that your physician administers when you`re in the physician`s office, for the first time in history, negotiate and use the power of Medicare to negotiate discounts in Part B.

So, actually, this is bigger and broader than anything that has ever been proposed before in Medicare, using the full power of Medicare to negotiate against pharma companies.

JUDY WOODRUFF: But aren`t you picking and choosing? You`re talking about Part B and you`re talking about Part D.

And, by the way, I`m sure many in our audience don`t quite -- unless they`re into Medicare, may not understand the differences. Wouldn`t it have been simpler, bigger and more effective to say all of Medicare can negotiate with these pharmaceutical companies, that that`s where the real clout would be?

ALEX AZAR: So, this actually pretty much includes every drug that we pay for in Medicare for seniors, the ones you buy at your pharmacy -- that`s that retail drug program -- and the drugs that you would have infused, for instance, by the doctor in the office. That`s that Part B.

This brings full-power negotiation, the power of the federal government, to all of those drugs. That`s our goal, all of those drugs.

The only critique has been really what -- frankly, it`s been a bit of a tired, cheap talking point -- has been this idea that I, as secretary, should do the negotiating directly, rather than companies that know how to do this.

Well, a couple of things. First, this is the same government that often brings you $400 toilet seats when it comes to procurement, so not the best at doing negotiations and procurement.

Second, Peter Orszag, who was the head of the Congressional Budget Office and then President Obama`s head of the Office of Management and Budget, he, OMB and CBO, under that leadership concluded that direct negotiations wouldn`t bring any material savings to the program.

But what we`re doing will, because we`re introducing more tools to negotiate, and we`re bringing negotiation to this other big segment of those drugs you get that the doctor administers to you for the first time ever.

I pay list price right now. Isn`t that amazing?

JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you`re saying this is the equivalent of doing what the president talked about during the campaign?

ALEX AZAR: It`s better. It is fulfilling the president`s commitment to negotiate and bid better, but even more.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me ask you about a couple of other elements. You have got a whole list of proposals here.

One of the things you`re talking about is requiring pharmaceutical companies to list the prices of drugs in their advertising. There are already skeptics out there saying, wait a minute, do you really think that this is going to work?

What makes you think that will work?

ALEX AZAR: Well, we fundamentally believe that, as a citizen, when you`re watching a TV ad that is trying to entice you to go to your doctor`s office and ask that doctor for a drug, that you are owed as part of a fair balance information, to know how much the drug costs.

What are they trying to get for that drug? I think it`s material to know if the drug that you`re being pitched is a $100 drug or a $50,000 drug.

God help you if a senior citizen watches an ad and pays for a doctor`s appointment to find out that it`s a $50,000, unaffordable drug that he or she couldn`t get. I just think that`s fair information they ought to have.

And so, today, I have called on America`s pharma industry to begin voluntarily disclosing list prices in their ads. We`re going to work the regulatory process, but they can start that now.

JUDY WOODRUFF: But do you -- how many of them do you think are going to take that -- take you up on that and do it?

ALEX AZAR: Well, we`re going to get there one way or the other, so I hope they will get there now.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Another part of this proposal, increasing -- you say increasing competition, lowering out-of-pocket costs.

What does that mean?

ALEX AZAR: Yes.

So, right now, so many people pay so much out of pocket for their medicines, especially as we now have these higher-deductible health care plans and as insurance companies have pushed more of the cost burden on to us.

When we walk into the pharmacy, we`re asked to pay such a higher percentage. So, we have got proposals for our Medicare plan to reduce how much our senior citizens will pay out of pocket.

And we have actually asked for Congress to put a cap on the amount of out of pocket a senior would ever have to pay during a year.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Total.

ALEX AZAR: Total.

We have asked for low-income senior citizens to pay nothing for generic drugs out of pocket. And we have already changed how we reimburse our drugs for those physician-administered infusion drugs. We have changed the reimbursement that pulls down the out-of-pocket for seniors by $320 million a year already.

JUDY WOODRUFF: This all requires congressional approval, though, right?

ALEX AZAR: Very little of it does.

Some of those changes to benefit design it just mentioned would require congressional approval. But the vast, vast majority of what we`re doing, I have the power to implement.

The secretary of HHS has a shocking amount of power by the stroke of a pen. And we intend to exercise it.

JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, another element of this, proposing to use trade deals to force foreign governments to pay more for the drugs they buy from U.S. pharmaceutical companies.

Some people are saying, OK, that sounds like a great idea, but how do we know those -- that these pharmaceutical companies are actually going to use that extra money to lower prices here in the United States?

ALEX AZAR: And I think that`s a fair question.

It`s not necessarily to lower it. It`s to ensure they`re paying their fair share.

JUDY WOODRUFF: All right.

ALEX AZAR: In the U.S., we need to pay less. And there are a host of initiatives we have had -- that we have to bring better negotiation and reduce list prices in the U.S. We have got to pay less. Our point is, they should be paying more of their fair share.

And I have already met with Ambassador Lighthizer, the U.S. trade representative. And he`s working on strategies on how we could take this to our trading partners, who ought to be paying more, and use the full weight of the U.S. government`s trading power to try to get them to pay more.

But the main thing we have got to do in the U.S. is bring our prices down.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Two more quick things.

One comes from critics. They point out you, Alex Azar, come to this position in government having been the head of the U.S. operations for Eli Lilly, one of the big pharmaceutical companies.

They`re saying, all right, if they didn`t do enough to lower prices then, how we can trust that you`re going to do it now?

ALEX AZAR: Yes, I could say judge me by our actions and the plans that we have and that we are putting out there, the most comprehensive plan to address drug pricing and bring them down of any president, Democratic or Republican, ideas in here that conservatives and liberals have never thought of.

How? Because we have experts at the table who know how this system works, know the levers that actually impact. I have been on the inside of it. I have worked in that system.

And one of the things that I love about being in the government, I can change the system. The rational actors, the pharma companies, every incentive in the system is towards higher prices. The system has to change.

The president has given me the -- he has given me the mandate to work the change that system.

JUDY WOODRUFF: One final question, in brief, health care coverage overall.

This administration, of course, has been moving to dismantle Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act. We learned this week that number of -- the rate of working-age Americans without health insurance has risen to 15.5 percent since 2016, and that things are worse in those states, those, I think, 19 states that decided not to expand Medicaid.

My question is, does this suggest that what the Trump administration is doing is leading to less health coverage? In other words, you`re ending up doing the opposite of what you wanted to do with health care coverage in this country.

ALEX AZAR: Absolutely not.

In fact, the Affordable Care Act plans are unaffordable and they`re lacking in choice for individuals. And it`s shoving these 28 million forgotten men and women out of that individual market. It`s pricing them out of that market.

What we`re trying to do is bring them low-cost plans that they can afford, and then work with Congress to actually replace the system with a better one.

And I want to use all of my administrative authority to try to make affordable insurance available for people. But within the contours of the individual market that the Obamacare created there, it`s pricing people out.

We had 6.7 million Americans pay $3.1 billion in the Affordable Care Act taxes to not buy insurance they couldn`t afford.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Big subject. We would love to have back on to talk about this in greater detail.

Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar, thank you very much.

ALEX AZAR: Thank you, Judy.

JUDY WOODRUFF: It is a particularly tense time on college campuses these days with final exams.

Many universities are trying to deal more explicitly with depression and anxiety among their students.

One school, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or MIT, found itself in the midst of a so-called suicide cluster several years ago that took the lives of six students and a faculty member.

Jeffrey Brown recently went to MIT to meet a professor and some students who are making a difference with their own efforts to bring mental health issues out from the shadows.

Here`s part one of Jeffrey`s report.

JEFFREY BROWN: Bright, accomplished, ambitious, also, at times, anxious, deeply depressed, sometimes even hopeless.

They are students at MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts, now part of a project to give a face and voice to a growing mental health crisis.

DANIEL JACKSON, Massachusetts Institute of Technology: It`s a global epidemic. It was this huge, pervasive problem, not just at MIT, but I believe in all kinds of places like MIT, that we needed to address.

JEFFREY BROWN: Daniel Jackson is a computer science professor at MIT. Several years ago, he began seeing a phenomenon on campus that took him out of his area of expertise.

DANIEL JACKSON: More and more students were coming to me, usually telling me that they wanted to talk about a problem set or an assignment. And when I sat down with them and talked to them, I would discover that the real problem was that they had some mental health issue that was holding them back and preventing them from doing the work. And it was tragic and pervasive.

JEFFREY BROWN: Do they say it to you, or you intuited, or how did that come out?

DANIEL JACKSON: Well, normally, we`d start talking about the problem set, and I would ask them a question like, how much time have you spent on this? Why is it proving so difficult?

And then often, they`d say something like, well, actually, I haven`t spent any time on it because I can`t motivate myself, or I can`t get out of bed in the morning, or I don`t feel like life is worthwhile.

And then the bells would start ringing in my head, and I realized I would need to chaperone them over to mental health and try and help them.

JEFFREY BROWN: MIT is one of the world`s most prestigious universities tough to get into, tough to succeed at.

But what was happening here was part of something bigger. According to a 2017 study of American colleges, nearly 40 percent of students said they felt so depressed in the prior year that it was difficult to function; 61 percent said they`d felt -- quote -- ""overwhelming anxiety.""

And suicide remains the second leading cause of death overall for college-aged people. Jackson also felt a deeply personal loss with the suicide of a friend on the faculty.

He decided to turn to his outside passion, photography, to help bring a stigmatized, private problem into the open.

DANIEL JACKSON: It struck me that the people who were suffering from depression and anxiety were still, as it were, in the dark. We have made great strides in destigmatizing depression, but we still really just talked in terms of numbers. We talked about abstractions of mental health issues, and we would say, this is normal, and there are so many people who suffer from it.

JEFFREY BROWN: Jackson put up posters around campus asking people to share their stories, and eventually interviewed and photographed some two dozen students, as well as faculty and staff members.

Emily Tang is now finishing her junior year, after depression forced her to take a two year leave of absence.

EMILY TANG, MIT Student: I would just sit there wrapped in a blanket. The achievement of the day was, I got out of bed. And I wasn`t eating. It was like one meal a day, and then that was usually like, you know, somebody had bought something and come home, and been like, eat this, please.

Everything felt like there like was like a layer of cotton, or fog, or something wrapped around my brain, and I just -- like, everything was just so blah.

JEFFREY BROWN: The essays and portraits were first published in the campus newspaper, The Tech. They`re now collected in a book, ""Portraits of Resilience.""

DANIEL JACKSON: I hoped to capture the personality and charisma of the person that I was interviewing, the strength and the vulnerability. And I wanted to make photos that weren`t sensationalist, but that captured something of the depth of the individual.

JEFFREY BROWN: The black-and-white portraits reveal a range of emotion.

Haley Cope is a senior in women and gender studies.

HALEY COPE, MIT Student: I can look at my experiences through the lens of my faith, and I can look at the experience of depression as a cross that I bear. And that gives a completely different view of the experience that I`m still grappling with.

JEFFREY BROWN: Victor Morales battled depression as a student and after graduating.

VICTOR MORALES, MIT Student: Depression, you know, whether it`s the good or the bad, whether it`s the happiness or the tears, for me, my depression was numb. It -- I felt nothing.

JEFFREY BROWN: The essays tell of different experiences and potential causes: genetic predisposition, traumas in their lives, a chronic health condition. And then there`s the stress on today`s students.

DANIEL JACKSON: I think life is much harder for students today than it was when I was a student. There`s so much pressure to perform. There are so many reductionist, numeric measures of success.

And this isn`t MIT. This is everywhere, whether it`s counting the number of Facebook likes you have, the number of times you`re retweeted, your GPA, your internship salary. Kids now have resumes when they`re in high school.

JEFFREY BROWN: Right, measurements of how they`re doing.

DANIEL JACKSON: That`s right.

JEFFREY BROWN: And maybe failing.

DANIEL JACKSON: That`s right. Well, in fact, I believe it`s not possible to succeed in this environment, because if you`re measuring yourself day by day by all these short-term ratings, eventually, you won`t measure up.

JEFFREY BROWN: Jackson`s answer, focus on the strengths and perseverance of people battling sometimes crippling depression, and the importance of friendships and loved ones to help them get through.

DANIEL JACKSON: Well, I thought of it as a way of making a gallery of people who could stand up and say, this is me, and I`m proud of my experience. Not only am I not ashamed by what happened to me, but I`m proud to tell my story and to show that it`s possible to struggle with depression or anxiety, whatever other mental health condition, and reach the light at the end of the tunnel.

JEFFREY BROWN: Jackson`s book was recently given to all first-year students.

For the ""PBS NewsHour,"" I`m Jeffrey Brown on the campus of MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Since the MeToo movement began last fall, seven members of Congress have resigned or retired after sexual harassment allegations.

There is near universal agreement that the system for investigating such accusations on Capitol Hill is deeply flawed. Yet Congress has not addressed their own rules.

Our Lisa Desjardins is here with this story -- Lisa.

LISA DESJARDINS: That`s right.

Still today, Judy, if you complain of harassment on Capitol Hill, you face a 90-day waiting period and a system that everyone agrees is stacked against victims.

Now, the House passed a bill three months ago to change this, overhaul it. But it has been frozen in the Senate.

We talked to three former staffers who are pushing for change this, among many hundreds who say this is an outrage.

Their names are Rebecca Weir, Anna Kain, and also Ally Steele.

They haven`t done much television. It was Anna`s first interview. She`s the staffer whose abuse led to the retirement of Congresswoman Elizabeth Esty.

They began by telling their stories, starting with Ally Steele.

ALLY COLL STEELE, Former Congressional Staffer: Yes, so my experience was when I was an 18-year-old intern. And it was my first experience really in a real job.

You know, I had heard some rumors about this member who ultimately groped me at the national -- Democratic National Convention in Boston at an evening event.

And, really, the message that was sent to me was that this was the cost of doing business. I was a young woman in politics, partly because, as I told people about my experience, I learned that this wasn`t a surprise to many people, that this behavior generally and from this particular member was somewhat of an open secret.

LISA DESJARDINS: You two are nodding. What do you think? Is that similar?

ANNA KAIN, Former Congressional Staffer: Yes.

I think, for me, it was -- I think the prevalence of harassment on the Hill is definitely very much an open secret.

My story -- the second year that I worked for Congresswoman Esty, I -- a colleague who I had dated the year before became her chief of staff in 2014. And that began about 14 months of pretty consistent harassment, which was sexual harassment. It was personal and professional beratement, and kind of explosive screaming fits in the office that once included him punching me in the back in the office.

And a year after I left the office, on May 5, 2016, he called me 53 times in a matter of just a few hours and threatened to find and kill me.

And I think that event was so significant to me because it was quite literally what scared me into both coming forward, but also recognizing the extent to which I was abused in the office throughout the entire second year that I had worked there.

LISA DESJARDINS: So, when you had a complaint, Anna, did you know where to go right away? What did you do?

ANNA KAIN: I did nothing, both because of -- I was being threatened by my then chief of staff from coming forward.

I had worried about the member that I worked for`s career and reelection. We had trainings on things like chemical leaks, but I had never participated in a sexual harassment training, which I think sends a very strong message to staffers about what is important and what is even worthy of being part of the conversation.

LISA DESJARDINS: Rebecca?

REBECCA WEIR, Former Congressional Staffer: My own personal experience was with my own member of Congress, a man who I respected.

It was the August recess. I had been working on a proposal. I went into his office. I said -- I made the proposal. He was open to it, which was great. I was feeling really good about it. And, as I got up to leave, he stopped me, and said: ""My God, Rebecca, you just look amazing today. Just really stunning. Would you mind twirling for me?""

I was stunned by the request, but I didn`t really know what to do. I was young and inexperienced. And I complied. He`s my member of Congress, and here he is asking me to do something. So I just -- I did it. Felt awful about it immediately after.

I went and sat down at my desk, tried to regroup, when I get a phone call from our Washington office, saying: ""Hey, Gary,"" my member of Congress, ""just called, and he said you were to have a bonus immediately. Don`t know what you did, but congratulations.""

Of course, I knew exactly what I had done.

LISA DESJARDINS: You felt like an object.

REBECCA WEIR: Totally. I felt like a prostitute. I mean, here I am getting paid not because of, you know, my professional, you know, accolades or my worth, but because of how I looked and how I made him feel.

LISA DESJARDINS: Is there a reason you think Congress and the power structure there is different?

REBECCA WEIR: I think there`s a couple systemic problems with just how the Hill functions, and as opposed to traditional employers.

You have -- especially on the House side, where there`s turnover every two years -- problem number two is that it is so individualized, either by party or by state, region. And so it`s -- there`s not really, again, a comprehensive approach to this.

LISA DESJARDINS: Each office, each member of Congress is in control of the rules for their office.

REBECCA WEIR: Correct. Each member of Congress is really the employer. It`s not -- you`re not working for Congress. You`re working for your member.

ALLY COLL STEELE: People come to Washington, D.C., because they want to work on the Hill. You will work really hard, as we have all mentioned, to get to the next level.

So there is a real desire to be there, and I think a willingness to put up with behavior in general that shouldn`t -- shouldn`t be accepted.

LISA DESJARDINS: How do you take this idea that, even after all these conversations, those who are elected to run this country have not been able to change a system that they all admit is flawed in their own offices?

ALLY COLL STEELE: I was really moved by what the House did in January. As a former Hill staffer, I was a little cynical about Congress` ability to quickly get things done.

But they did. They responded really quickly to this moment and with a bill that makes a lot of really important changes. And so it`s been dismaying to see it held up in the Senate for so long.

ANNA KAIN: Yes, I think it`s very frustrating that the Senate won`t act on -- to pass reform on this issue.

I think it`s been made very clear that this isn`t a Republican or Democratic issue. This isn`t a men`s issue or a women`s issue. I think this is -- and this isn`t a vague or hypothetical issue either. This is a very practical issue that affects day to day the people -- the safety and well-being of the people who work for these representatives.

And I think they have -- they absolutely have a responsibility to act.

LISA DESJARDINS: There are some people who say this conversation has actually gone too far, and that now things which are very minor are being considered to be harassment.

How do you respond to that?

ALLY COLL STEELE: In terms of Congress acting on this legislation, I don`t have a concern that it`s going too far at all. I think, in fact, it`s simply making changes that are long overdue.

REBECCA WEIR: I don`t think it`s gone too far. It`s never a bad thing for people to reflect on their own privilege, their own status, their own power, and try and see their interactions through a different lens.

And I think all these little things, we`re not talking about them individually. You know, an insensitive comment here, you know, whatever there, that`s not what we`re talking about. It`s them together, taken as a whole, really encage us and inhibit us from going forward and finding our full potential. That`s what we`re talking about.

LISA DESJARDINS: Are you worried about current staffers on the Hill? Where would you recommend they go to complain? Is it even clear yet that they have a place to go?

ALLY COLL STEELE: Well, I think that the -- that`s why it`s so important for the Senate to act right now, is that it is unclear what the current environment is for women who experienced misconduct on the Hill.

And if I were a current staffer on the Hill, I`m not sure that I would know whether reporting was going to come at a risk of retaliation.

ANNA KAIN: Ultimately, this is a conversation that should be had, and I think it should be had out loud.

And I think, in order for anything to change either legislatively or culturally, we just need to keep talking about it and having these conversations.

LISA DESJARDINS: Ally Steele, Anna Kain, Rebecca Weir, thank you very much for talking with us.

REBECCA WEIR: Thank you for having us.

ANNA KAIN: Thank you.

ALLY COLL STEELE: Thanks.

JUDY WOODRUFF: From the president`s announcement the U.S. will reconsider sanctions on a Chinese phone company to the opening of the American Embassy in Jerusalem, there`s a lot of news today with potentially far-reaching political fallout.

To discuss it all, I`m joined by Amy Walter of The Cook Political Report and Susan Page of USA Today.

Politics Monday. Welcome to both of you.

So, Amy, this festive celebration today in Jerusalem. The president promised, I`m moving that embassy to Jerusalem. It`s happened, celebrating there, but a few miles away big protests on the part of the Palestinians, more than 50 dead. What about the political calculus for the White House?

AMY WALTER, The Cook Political Report: Yes, I think that this was clearly something that the president, like many things he talked about on the campaign trail, campaign promise that he wants to show Americans he can keep.

And this is especially important for a group of voters that have been the most consistently supportive of the president, and that`s evangelical voters, who have seen this decision to move the capital -- the embassy -- excuse me -- to Jerusalem as really a high point in the president`s tenure.

We talk a lot about these evangelical voters and how do they find a way to square the president`s behavior with his presidency, and I think it really is on things like this, where, on the policies, they see somebody that is supporting them and fighting for them in a way they haven`t seen in other presidents, even Republican presidents who were more outwardly religious.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Susan, how do you see the upsides, downsides politically?

SUSAN PAGE, Washington Bureau Chief, USA Today: It`s certainly true, as the White House side, that other presidents had promised to do this or had supported the idea, and then not followed through.

But the reason they didn`t follow through was because, once you`re actually president, you can see the costs involved, the costs involved in these deadly protests we saw in Gaza, also the costs involving in the U.S. role going forward as an honest broker in the Middle East.

That is now gone. I think it`s unlikely that the Palestinians will be willing to see the United States as an honest broker in negotiations for the rest of the Trump presidency.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, another development we have seen in the last few days was an international component, Amy.

And that is the president`s surprising tweet over the weekend that he wants to negotiate a better deal for this Chinese telecom giant called ZTE. He`s now -- the administration now worried they`re losing a lot of jobs. They want to renegotiate everything.

So, the question is -- this is the president who talks about America first, America first, but here he`s worried about Chinese jobs.

AMY WALTER: Right.

Whenever we talk about President Trump, we try to talk -- people like us talk about policy and we try to put it in this nice little context of what it`s going to mean.

I think, for so many voters, what they do is they see President Trump through the prism of his personality, not his policies. And so for plenty of voters out there who supported the president, they said, he`s a businessman, he`s a negotiator, he`s going to figure it out. This is how you negotiate. You give them a little, they give you a little, and you finally come out with a better deal.

So they are not going to see this as, wait a minute, you`re giving away something to the Chinese, especially something that has far-reaching consequences when it comes to security issues?

And then, if you`re opposed to the president, you say, well, we told you so, right? This is a guy who said he was going to be a great negotiate, he doesn`t know what he`s doing, he`s giving away jobs, or at least he`s putting more emphasis on Chinese jobs, and not as concerned about security as he should be.

But, at the end of the day, the policy piece is really filtered through whether you believe that he`s going to be able to deliver on his promise.

SUSAN PAGE: Let me disagree with you.

AMY WALTER: OK.

SUSAN PAGE: Which is that I can see a campaign ad in the making, saving Chinese jobs? And if you can see an ad in a place that didn`t get manufacturing jobs back, the way the president promised when he campaigned there in 2016, and instead protected Chinese jobs, and with a very controversial way, a company that is linked to the Chinese government, that has been identified as posing a cyber-security threat.

Their products cannot be sold on U.S. bases because of -- for fears for how they can be manipulated.

So I think this is a perplexing step by the president. And I would be, I guess, surprised if he ends up following through on it. I wouldn`t be surprised if they pull back in a major way from what he promised to do.

JUDY WOODRUFF: I noticed he`s tweeting today trying to clarify.

AMY WALTER: But isn`t that`s what we have seen all along, right?

The tariffs come out, and then the tariffs have caveats. And then the decision comes out on Twitter, and then it gets sort of cleaned up afterwards. I think this has been part of the course.

But even -- I think it`s going to take something pretty significant, in other words, a real bite out of people, whether it`s the tariffs. We heard that there`s going to be all this uproar in the heartland because farmers are upset about these tariffs, these people who supported the president.

And yet you don`t see a real loss of support from the president there. When I talk to some of the folks out there, the sense is, we trust him to do the right thing.

Now, if that turns out not to be true, then I would agree with you. But I think for now there`s still a sense that we hired him to do this kind of job, for the people who support him. If you don`t like him, it doesn`t matter what he does. You`re never going to give him credit for anything.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Speaking of the heartland, Susan, the voters were actually -- they`re starting to speak. We`re starting to see primary contests out there.

Last week, you had, what, West Virginia, Indiana, Ohio, North Carolina, tomorrow, a primary in Pennsylvania and elsewhere.

Are we seeing any patterns here? I know it`s early. It`s still may, the election finally in November, but are we learning anything from this?

SUSAN PAGE: I think we`re seeing a lot of Democratic energy both in the primaries and especially in the special elections.

The special elections, even the ones the Democrats didn`t win, they perform so much better than they did two years ago. It`s given Democrats, I think, a lot of hope that this is a good year for them.

Pennsylvania, a state that has a primary tomorrow, an important state to look at, because you remember they had to change all their congressional lines because of a gerrymandering case. They have had some Republicans retire.

They have got, I think, 18 congressional districts. And I think that maybe five of them, according to The Cook Political Report, might be flippable for Democrats. They might pick up five seats just in Pennsylvania. They need to pick up 23 to win control of the House. Picking up five seats would get you a long way there.

AMY WALTER: And adding on to that, the candidates who may be the nominees here on the Democratic side, they are women in every single one of those districts.

So you could see a state that right now has zero women in the delegation actually having five potentially in the delegation. And, you know, one of the story lines of this year is the energy among women voters, the candidates.

A lot of these women who are running here are first-time candidates. They have never done anything like this before. They were brought out of the woodwork by the last election.

JUDY WOODRUFF: And a lot of them going up against incumbents, who are historically tough to beat, but a lot of story lines we will be following in the months to come.

Amy Walter, Susan Page, Politics Monday, thank you.

SUSAN PAGE: Thank you.

AMY WALTER: You`re welcome.

On Sunday, the World Health Organisation (WHO) announced that it will be administering experimental vaccines to help combat the spread of the Ebola virus in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.WHO says it will be working with the ministry of health, Gavi and Médecins Sans FrontiÃ¨res (MSF) to conduct ring vaccinations in the affected health zones.The organisation will administer the vaccination to healthcare workers and anyone else who has been potentially exposed to Ebola. According to WHO's Spokesperson, Tarik JaÅ¡areviÄ‡, there have been 39 reported Ebola cases from April 4 through May 13.The announcement comes after Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus visited the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to determine the significance of the Ebola outbreak in the north-west of the country.In a statement released on Sunday, WHO announced that they will be providing resources to the area in order to combat the virus. The measures include providing vaccinations to prevent the disease and administering supplies to support infected individuals. In the report, WHO states that it will also be ""working with the Ministry of Health to gather and test samples, conduct contact tracing and improve data collection and management"" to learn more about the outbreak.Tedros said that he is impressed by the government's response to the outbreak and that they are ""investing in rapidly establishing the key elements of Ebola containment.""The vaccine, which is called recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus-Zaire Ebola virus (rVSV-ZEBOV) is still experimental, but according to WHO's website, it proved successful in a trial in Guinea in 2015. People who received the vaccine did not get infected 10 or days more after receiving it, while there were 23 Ebola cases reported in the same time frame among individuals who did not receive the vaccine.According to WHO, Ebola is a haemorrhagic fever that is spread through direct human-to-human contact. 

Although not confirmed, the disease is thought to be carried in fruit bats and can be transmitted through blood or bodily fluids between wild animals and humans. Early symptoms of the virus can appear two to 21 days after infection and include fever, muscle pain, headache and sore throat. Later symptoms include ""vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, symptoms of impaired kidney and liver function and internal and external bleeding"", according to WHO. In some cases the virus can lead to death.The disease first appeared simultaneously in South Sudan and the DRC in 1976. In 2014-2016, the disease plagued West Africa leaving countries such as Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia with more cases and deaths from the virus than they ever had. WHO described the outbreak as, ""largest and most complex Ebola outbreak since the virus was first discovered."" In those three countries, there were an estimated 28 610 cases and 11 308 deaths during the outbreak.Although the DRC was not plagued by this particular, it faced an outbreak of its own in 2012, with 57 reported cases and 29 reported deaths, meaning that there was a 51% mortality rate. According to JaÅ¡areviÄ‡, this is the ninth Ebola outbreak in DRC and that it is ""endemic"" to the country.JaÅ¡areviÄ‡ said that the origin of this outbreak is unknown, but there are epidemiologists investigating it. In order to prevent the spread of the disease, WHO recommends that individuals take caution when handling dead animals. The organisation also recommends that meat should be cooked ""thoroughly"".In regards to human-to-human contact, the organisation says that healthy individuals should use gloves and proper equipment when in contact with infected individuals. They also recommend frequent handwashing, safe sexual practices and careful burial of the dead.",4,The organisation will administer the vaccination to healthcare workers and anyone else who has been potentially exposed to Ebola.,0.44494280219078064,7.152579784393311,2

",320609,"The World Health Organization (WHO) and a broad range of partners are in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) working with the Government to contain an outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Bikoro health zone, Equateur Province. The outbreak was declared three days ago.

WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus will travel to the DRC over the week-end to take stock of the situation and direct the continuing response in support of the national health authorities.

As of 11 May, 34 Ebola cases have been reported in the area in the past five weeks, including 2 confirmed, 18 probable (deceased) and 14 suspected cases. Five samples were collected from 5 patients and two have been confirmed by the laboratory. Bikoro health zone is 250 km from Mbandaka, capital of Equateur Province in an area of the country that is very hard to reach.

“WHO staff were in the team that first identified the outbreak. I myself am on my way to the DRC to assess the needs first-hand,” said Dr Tedros. “I’m in contact with the Minister of Health and have assured him that we’re ready to do all that’s needed to stop the spread of Ebola quickly. We are working with our partners to send more staff, equipment and supplies to the area.”

A multidisciplinary team including WHO experts, along with staff from the Provincial Division of Health and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), arrived in Bikoro on 10 May. This first group of responders is now gathering more data to understand the extent and drivers of the epidemic. The team will also set up an active case search and contact tracing, establish Ebola treatment units to care for patients, set up mobile labs, and engage the community on safe practices. WHO will also work with national authorities in planning further public health measures such as vaccination campaigns.

“WHO is supporting the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in coordinating this response; this is the country’s ninth Ebola outbreak and there is considerable expertise in-country,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “However, any country facing such a threat may require international assistance. WHO and its partners including MSF, World Food Programme (WFP), UNICEF, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and the Congolese Red Cross, UNOCHA and MONUSCO , US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US-CDC), the International Organization for Migration (IOM), are all stepping up their support.”

The response plan to the outbreak includes surveillance, case investigation, and contact tracing; community engagement and social mobilization; case management and infection prevention and control; safe and dignified burials; research response including the use of ring vaccination and antivirals; and coordination and operations support.

“It is too early to judge the extent of this outbreak,” said Dr Peter Salama, WHO Deputy Director-General for Emergency Preparedness and Response. “However, early signs including the infection of 3 health workers, the geographical extent of the outbreak, the proximity to transport routes and population centres, and the number of suspected cases indicate that stopping this outbreak will be a serious challenge. This will be tough and it will be costly. We need to be prepared for all scenarios.”

In its latest Disease Outbreak News, WHO lists the risks to surrounding countries as moderate. WHO has however, already alerted those countries and is working with them on border surveillance and preparedness for potential outbreaks. WHO does not at this time advise any restrictions on travel and trade to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.Current operations: The first multidisciplinary team comprised of experts from WHO, Médecins Sans Frontières and the Provincial Division of Health arrived in Bikoro on 9 May to strengthen coordination and investigations. More deployments of epidemiologists, logisticians, clinicians, infection prevention and control experts, risk communications experts and vaccination support teams should arrive in Bikoro on Saturday.

WHO is working with Government and key partners – including Médecins Sans Frontières, World Food Programme, the International Federation of the Red Cross, UNICEF and US-CDC – to strengthen coordination of the EVD response at the national level and in the affected Bikoro health zone and is calling on its development partners to ensure a strong, comprehensive and rapid response to support the DRC Government to prevent and control the spreading of the disease.

Two mobile labs are planned to be deployed on 12 May.

Current bed capacity includes 15 beds in Bikoro. MSF is currently establishing isolation on site and has also deployed four mobile isolation units (5 beds each).

WHO is coordinating a major flight plan with UNHAS/WFP to deploy experts, equipment and materials to the field and is working closely with other health partners to prevent further geographical spread, improve surveillance data and reduce deaths by improving treatment of Ebola patients in Bikoro and the epicentre of Ikoko-Impenge.  The cost of the air bridge for 3 months is estimated at US$ 2.4 million.

A logistician is expected to arrive in Bikoro this afternoon/evening to arrange accommodation/staff logistics. Additional information on access, transportation, and logistics requirements will be communicated tomorrow.

WHO is in the process of sending (Saturday) medical supplies to Bikoro to support the Ebola response, including:

Personal Protective Equipment kits (PPE)Interagency Emergency Health Kit (IEHK)boxes for transportationbody bags

WHO is helping with surveillance of cases by setting up community-based data collection to complement information provided by health facilities.
